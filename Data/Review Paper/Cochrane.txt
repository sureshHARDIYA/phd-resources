AB: Abstract - Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a serious disorder characterised by persistent postexertional fatigue and substantial symptoms related to cognitive, immune and autonomous dysfunction. There is no specific diagnostic test, therefore diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose CFS. The prevalence of CFS varies by type of diagnostic criteria used. Existing treatment strategies primarily aim to relieve symptoms and improve function. One treatment option is exercise therapy. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for adults with CFS compared with any other intervention or control on fatigue, adverse outcomes, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, mood disorders, sleep, self‐perceived changes in overall health, health service resources use and dropout. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group controlled trials register, CENTRAL, and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014, using a comprehensive list of free‐text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished and ongoing studies through the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to May 2014. We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, from all diagnostic criteria, who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). To facilitate interpretation of SMDs, we re‐expressed SMD estimates as MDs on more common measurement scales. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included eight RCTs with data from 1518 participants. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured effect at the end of the treatment and at long‐term follow‐up, after 50 weeks or 72 weeks. Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapies such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, and one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control, including treatment as usual, relaxation or flexibility (eight studies); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (two studies); cognitive therapy (one study); supportive listening (one study); pacing (one study); pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Most studies had a low risk of selection bias. All had a high risk of performance and detection bias. Exercise therapy compared with 'passive' control Exercise therapy probably reduces fatigue at end of treatment (SMD −0.66, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.31; 7 studies, 840 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence; re‐expressed MD −3.4, 95% CI −5.3 to −1.6; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain if fatigue is reduced in the long term because the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD −0.62, 95 % CI −1.32 to 0.07; 4 studies, 670 participants; re‐expressed MD −3.2, 95% CI −6.9 to 0.4; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants). Exercise therapy may moderately improve physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long‐term effect is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Exercise therapy may also slightly improve sleep at end of treatment and at long term. The effect of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life and depression is uncertain because evidence is missing or of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with CBT Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to fatigue at end of treatment (MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐1.49 to 1.89; 1 study, 298 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or at long‐term follow‐up (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.28; 2 studies, 351 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96; 1 study, 321 participants). The available evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between exercise therapy and CBT in physical functioning or sleep (low‐certainty evidence) and probably little or no difference in the effect on depression (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise therapy compared to CBT improves quality of life or reduces pain because the evidence is of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with adaptive pacing Exercise therapy may slightly reduce fatigue at end of treatment (MD −2.00, 95% CI −3.57 to −0.43; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and at long‐term follow‐up (MD −2.50, 95% CI −4.16 to −0.84; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 307 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The available evidence suggests that exercise therapy may slightly improve physical functioning, depression and sleep compared to adaptive pacing (low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported quality of life or pain. Exercise therapy compared with antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressants, reduces fatigue and depression more than antidepressant alone, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. The one included study did not report on adverse reactions, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, sleep or long‐term results. Authors' conclusions Exercise therapy probably has a positive effect on fatigue in adults with CFS compared to usual care or passive therapies. The evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of CBT, adaptive pacing or other interventions. All studies were conducted with outpatients diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria, or both. Patients diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects. Plain language summary Exercise as treatment for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome What is the aim of this review? People with chronic fatigue syndrome have long‐lasting fatigue, joint pain, headaches, sleep problems, poor concentration and short‐term memory. These symptoms cause significant disability and distress. We wanted to find out whether exercise therapy can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis). Key messages People who have exercise therapy probably have less fatigue at the end of treatment than those who receive more passive therapies. We are uncertain if this improvement lasts in the long term. We are also uncertain about the risk of serious side effects from exercise therapy. What was studied in the review? We explored whether exercise therapy can reduce chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms. We searched for studies comparing the effect of exercise therapy with treatment as usual or other therapies. What are the main results of the review? We found eight studies with 1518 participants. The studies compared participants who received exercise therapy to participants who received treatment as usual or more active treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Participants had exercise therapy for 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured the effect of the therapy at the end of the treatment and also long term, after 50 or 72 weeks. Participants exercised at different levels of intensity using variations of aerobic exercising such as walking, swimming or cycling. Exercise therapy compared to treatment as usual or relaxation Participants who have exercise therapy probably have less fatigue at the end of treatment, and they may have moderately better physical functioning. We are uncertain if these improvements last long term because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Participants who have exercise therapy may have slightly better sleep, both at the end of treatment and long term. We are uncertain about the risk of serious side effects and the effects of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life, and depression. This is because we lack evidence or because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to cognitive behavioural therapy Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to participants’ fatigue at end of treatment or in the long term. Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to participants’ physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long‐term effect on physical functioning is uncertain. No studies looked at the effect of exercise therapy on depression at the end of treatment, but it probably has little or no long‐term effect. We are uncertain about the risk of side effects. We are also uncertain about the effects on pain, quality of life, or sleep. This is because we lack evidence or because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to adaptive pacing (living within limits) Participants who have exercise therapy may have slightly less fatigue and depressive symptoms and slightly better physical functioning and sleep at the end of treatment and long term than participants who have adaptive pacing. We are uncertain about the risk of serious side effects. We are also uncertain about the effect on quality of life or pain. This is because we lack evidence or we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy is better than antidepressants at reducing fatigue. We are also uncertain of its effect on depression, side effects, pain, physical functioning, quality of life or sleep. This is because we lack evidence or we are very uncertain about the evidence. Why is this review important? Exercise therapy is recommended by treatment guidelines and often used as treatment for people with chronic fatigue syndrome. People with chronic fatigue syndrome should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment based on robust research evidence and whether exercise therapy is effective, either as a stand‐alone intervention or as part of a treatment plan. It is important to note that the evidence in this review is from people diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria. People diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects.

AB: Abstract - Background Normal aging is associated with changes in cognitive function that are non‐pathological and are not necessarily indicative of future neurocognitive disease. Low cognitive and brain reserve and limited cognitive stimulation are associated with increased risk of dementia. Emerging evidence now suggests that subtle cognitive changes, detectable years before criteria for mild cognitive impairment are met, may be predictive of future dementia. Important for intervention and reduction in disease risk, research also suggests that engaging in stimulating mental activity throughout adulthood builds cognitive and brain reserve and reduces dementia risk. Therefore, midlife (defined here as 40 to 65 years) may be a suitable time to introduce cognitive interventions for maintaining cognitive function and, in the longer term, possibly preventing or delaying the onset of clinical dementia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for maintaining or improving cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in midlife. Search methods We searched up to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG). We ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP at  www.apps.who.int/trialsearch , to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people between 40 and 65 years of age (80% of study population within this age range). Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention ‐ including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality ‐ that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. Data collection and analysis For preliminary screening of search results, we used a 'crowd' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened remaining citations against inclusion criteria; independently extracted data; and assessed the quality of the included trial, using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We used GRADE to describe the overall quality of the evidence. Main results We identified one eligible study that examined the effect of computerised cognitive training (CCT) in 6742 participants over 50 years of age, with training and follow‐up duration of six months. We considered the study to be at high risk of attrition bias and the overall quality of the evidence to be low. Researchers provided no data on our primary outcome. Results indicate that there may be a small advantage for the CCT group for executive function (mean difference (MD) ‐1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.85 to ‐1.29; participants = 3994; low‐quality evidence) and a very small advantage for the control group for working memory (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15; participants = 5831; low‐quality evidence). The intervention may have had little or no effect on episodic memory (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.04; participants = 3090; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence from only one study. We are unable to determine whether computerised cognitive training is effective in maintaining global cognitive function among healthy adults in midlife. We strongly recommend that high‐quality studies be undertaken to investigate the effectiveness and acceptability of cognitive training in midlife, using interventions that last long enough that they may have enduring effects on cognitive and brain reserve, and with investigators following up long enough to assess effects on clinically important outcomes in later life. Plain language summary Computerised cognitive training for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in midlife Background The terms 'cognition' and 'cognitive function' describe all the mental activities related to thinking, learning, remembering, and communicating. Normal changes in cognition become evident with aging. Also, diseases may affect cognition, principally dementia, which becomes increasingly common with increasing age from about 65 years onwards. Researchers have shown a great deal of interest in trying to prevent cognitive decline and dementia. It is known that being mentally active throughout life is associated with lower risk of dementia. Therefore, it is has been suggested that encouraging mental activity in midlife (which we define in this review as 40 to 65 years of age) might be an effective way of maintaining good cognitive function as people age. Cognitive training involves a set of standardised tasks intended to 'exercise the brain' in various ways. Programmes of cognitive training are often delivered by way of computers or mobile technology so that people can perform activities on their own at home. Increasingly, these are provided in commercial packages that are advertised to the general public. We wanted to know whether computerised cognitive training is an effective way for people between 40 and 65 years of age to maintain good cognitive function as they age. What we did We searched the medical literature up to 15 March 2018 for trials that compared the cognitive function of people 40 to 65 years of age who had taken part in computerised cognitive training lasting at least three months versus a control group that had not done so. For the comparison to be as fair as possible, it should have been decided randomly whether participants were assigned to the cognitive training group or the control group. We were primarily interested in overall measures of cognition. The choice of three months of intervention was somewhat arbitrary, but we thought it unlikely that shorter periods of training could have long‐lasting effects. What we found We found that a lot of shorter studies had been conducted, but only one study met our criteria for this review. It took place in the UK and included two different types of online cognitive training. The control group participated in an online game that was not expected to have cognitive effects. This training lasted six months, and study authors measured cognition at the end of the training period. Resarchers randomised 6742 people in the study, but the dropout rate was high. We thought this put the results at high risk of bias; therefore we considered the quality of evidence provided by this study to be low, meaning that further research might well lead to different results. This study did not measure overall cognitive functioning ‐ which we were most interested in ‐ but it did measure some subtypes of cognitive function. The cognitive training group did slightly better on a test of reasoning, and the control group did very slightly better on a test of working memory, which is a very short‐term type of memory. No evidence suggested that the groups differed in memory measured by a word‐learning test. Our conclusions We were not able to tell whether taking part in computerised cognitive training in midlife has any lasting effects on cognitive function. We think this is an important question that should be investigated further in trials that test cognitive training over three months or longer. It will also be important for researchers to try to find the best ways to keep people motivated to persist with training.

AB: Abstract - Background People living in humanitarian settings in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) are exposed to a constellation of stressors that make them vulnerable to developing mental disorders. Mental disorders with a higher prevalence in these settings include post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform (e.g. medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS)), and related disorders. A range of psychological therapies are used to manage symptoms of mental disorders in this population. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies versus control conditions (wait list, treatment as usual, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or no treatment) aimed at treating people with mental disorders (PTSD and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform, and related disorders) living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), and PsycINFO (OVID), with results incorporated from searches to 3 February 2016. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any unpublished or ongoing studies. We checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies versus control conditions (including no treatment, usual care, wait list, attention placebo, and psychological placebo) to treat adults and children with mental disorders living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane procedures for collecting data and evaluating risk of bias. We calculated standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous data, using a random‐effects model. We analysed data at endpoint (zero to four weeks after therapy); at medium term (one to four months after therapy); and at long term (six months or longer). GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the quality of evidence for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and withdrawal outcomes. Main results We included 36 studies (33 RCTs) with a total of 3523 participants. Included studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia. Studies were implemented in response to armed conflicts; disasters triggered by natural hazards; and other types of humanitarian crises. Together, the 33 RCTs compared eight psychological treatments against a control comparator. Four studies included children and adolescents between 5 and 18 years of age. Three studies included mixed populations (two studies included participants between 12 and 25 years of age, and one study included participants between 16 and 65 years of age). Remaining studies included adult populations (18 years of age or older). Included trials compared a psychological therapy versus a control intervention (wait list in most studies; no treatment; treatment as usual). Psychological therapies were categorised mainly as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) in 23 comparisons (including seven comparisons focused on narrative exposure therapy (NET), two focused on common elements treatment approach (CETA), and one focused on brief behavioural activation treatment (BA)); eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) in two comparisons; interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in three comparisons; thought field therapy (TFT) in three comparisons; and trauma or general supportive counselling in two comparisons. Although interventions were described under these categories, several psychotherapeutic elements were common to a range of therapies (i.e. psychoeducation, coping skills). In adults, psychological therapies may substantially reduce endpoint PTSD symptoms compared to control conditions (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.34 to ‐0.79; 1272 participants; 16 studies; low‐quality evidence). The effect is smaller at one to four months (SMD ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐0.68 to ‐0.31; 1660 participants; 18 studies) and at six months (SMD ‐0.37, 95% CI ‐0.61 to ‐0.14; 400 participants; five studies). Psychological therapies may also substantially reduce endpoint depression symptoms compared to control conditions (SMD ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.06 to ‐0.67; 1254 participants; 14 studies; low‐quality evidence). Similar to PTSD symptoms, follow‐up data at one to four months showed a smaller effect on depression (SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.21; 1386 participants; 16 studies). Psychological therapies may moderately reduce anxiety at endpoint (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.49; 694 participants; five studies; low‐quality evidence) and at one to four months' follow‐up after treatment (SMD ‐0.53, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.39; 969 participants; seven studies). Dropout rates are probably similar between study conditions (19.5% with control versus 19.1% with psychological therapy (RR 0.98 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16; 2930 participants; 23 studies, moderate quality evidence)). In children and adolescents, we found very low quality evidence for lower endpoint PTSD symptoms scores in psychotherapy conditions (CBT) compared to control conditions, although the confidence interval is wide (SMD ‐1.56, 95% CI ‐3.13 to 0.01; 130 participants; three studies;). No RCTs provided data on major depression or anxiety in children. The effect on withdrawal was uncertain (RR 1.87 95% CI 0.47 to 7.47; 138 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence). We did not identify any studies that evaluated psychological treatments on (symptoms of) somatoform disorders or MUPS in LMIC humanitarian settings. Authors' conclusions There is low quality evidence that psychological therapies have large or moderate effects in reducing PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in adults living in humanitarian settings in LMICs. By one to four month and six month follow‐up assessments treatment effects were smaller. Fewer trials were focused on children and adolescents and they provide very low quality evidence of a beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing PTSD symptoms at endpoint. Confidence in these findings is influenced by the risk of bias in the studies and by substantial levels of heterogeneity. More research evidence is needed, particularly for children and adolescents over longer periods of follow‐up. Plain language summary Talking therapy for the management of mental health in low‐ and middle‐income countries affected by mass human tragedy Why is this review important? Adults and children and adolescents living in humanitarian contexts (such as in the aftermath of a crisis triggered by natural hazards) in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) are exposed to multifaceted stressors that make them more vulnerable to developing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, anxiety, and other negative psychological outcomes. Who will be interested in this review? People who are directly exposed to humanitarian crises and their families and caregivers will be interested in this review, as will healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals working both in LMICs and in high‐income settings. Moreover, policy makers, humanitarian programming staff, guideline developers, and agencies (such as non‐governmental organisations (NGOs)) working in health and non‐health sectors (e.g. those providing protection to populations living in humanitarian contexts) may be interested in this review. What questions does this review aim to answer? Are psychological therapies more effective than control comparator conditions (including no treatment, usual care, wait list, attention placebo, and psychological placebo) in reducing (symptoms of) PTSD and major depressive, anxiety, and somatoform and related disorders (conditions in which people present physical symptoms (e.g. pain) that cannot be explained medically) in people of any age, gender, or religion living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises? Which studies were included in this review? Review authors searched databases up to February 2016 to find and include all relevant published and unpublished trials. Studies had to include children and/or adults living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. Studies also had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which means that people were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive the treatment or comparator condition. We included 33 trials with a total of 3523 participants that examined a range of psychological therapies. What does evidence presented in the review tell us? In adults, low‐quality evidence shows greater benefit from psychological therapies than from control comparators in reducing (symptoms of) PTSD, major depression, and anxiety disorders. This evidence supports the approach of providing psychological therapies to populations affected by humanitarian crises, although we identified no studies that looked at the effectiveness or acceptability of psychological therapies for depressive and anxiety symptoms beyond six months. Only a small proportion of included trials reported data on children and adolescents, which provided very low‐quality evidence of greater benefit derived from psychological treatments. With regard to acceptability, moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence suggests no differences in dropout rates among adults and children and adolescents. Reviewers found no studies evaluating psychological treatments for (symptoms of) somatoform disorders or medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) in adults, nor in children or adolescents, respectively. What should happen next? Researchers should conduct higher‐quality trials to further evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies provided over longer periods to adults and to children and adolescents. Ideally, trials should be randomised, should use culturally appropriate and validated instruments to evaluate outcomes, and should assess correlates of reductions in treatment effects over time; in addition, researchers should make every effort to ensure high rates of follow‐up beyond six months after completion of therapy.

AB: Abstract - Background Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co‐ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long‐term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including ‘treatment as usual’, standard community treatment and other non‐case management interventions. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated. Selection criteria We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co‐ordination of care. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed‐ or random‐effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the I² statistic. Main results We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias. The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 ‐ 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, I² = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD ‐5.80, 95% CI ‐7.93 to ‐3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD ‐7.70, 95% CI ‐9.38 to ‐6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 ‐ 6, 12, 18 ‐ 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.12 to ‐0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs, I² = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs I² = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs). The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.16 to ‐0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I² = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well‐being in a single study at six months (MD ‐2.20 CI CI ‐4.14 to ‐0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.12 to ‐0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD= ‐705.00, 95% CI ‐1170.31 to ‐239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good‐quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow‐up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta‐analysis. Plain language summary Case management approaches to home support for people with dementia Background:  Many people are affected by dementia and the numbers are expected to rise as populations age. Most types of dementia are characterised by loss of memory and impairment in other cognitive functions, accompanied by functional impairment and difficulties in performing activities of daily living. The increasing number of people with dementia means more demand for both informal and formal sources of care. The extent of support provided depends on factors such as living situation, patient's and carer's characteristics, service provision, and availability of social networks. There are also wider financial costs of care, for example carers missing work for appointments or crises, becoming part‐time workers, or leaving work altogether. Developing interventions such as case management, which enhances the co‐ordination between different agencies involved in community care, might offer the support necessary to cover some of the needs of people with dementia and their carers. How case management is organised and implemented varies widely, and access to this type of care is influenced by long‐term care funding policies and cultural variations in different countries. Case management has been tested in people with dementia and in carers in a number of countries and healthcare systems, but it is not clear whether current evidence supports its effectiveness. Study characteristics:  We found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including 9615 participants with dementia worldwide. Eleven RCTs also included carers. Studies were conducted in different countries, varied in size and healthcare systems and compared various types of case management interventions with usual care or augmented usual care. Key findings:  Some studies examined the benefit of case management in reducing admissions to residential or nursing homes (institutionalisation). We found benefits at six months and 18 months but not at 12 and 24 months. However, when only studies which were clearly focused upon delaying institutionalisation or prolonging the period of community care were included we found a reduction in institutionalisation at 12 months. Some studies examined the benefits of case management in terms of reduced hospital length of stay, and there was evidence to suggest that it might increase at six months. Some studies indicated that case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months, reducing carer burden and depression and improving carer well‐being at six months and social support at 12 months. Case management increases the use of community services but there was some indication that overall healthcare costs may be reduced in the first year. Some studies reported that case management was no more effective than usual care in improving patient depression, functional abilities or cognition. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could increase the length of time until people with dementia were admitted to care homes. Quality of the evidence:  There were some problems regarding the methods of the studies. Similarly, the different ways in which the case management interventions were provided and the differences in outcome measurements made it difficult to draw clear conclusions.

AB: Abstract - Background Increasing age is associated with a natural decline in cognitive function and is also the greatest risk factor for dementia. Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or to reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and is intended to maintain optimum cognitive function. This review examines the effect of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older. Objectives To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for the maintenance or improvement of cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life. Search methods We searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ) and performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP ( www.apps.who.int/trialsearch ) to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention ‐ including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality ‐ that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. Data collection and analysis We performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random‐effect meta‐analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. Researchers provided interventions over 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Review authors noted a lot of inconsistency between trial results. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we were unable to determine any effect of CCT on our primary outcome of global cognitive function or on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, speed of processing, executive function, and working memory. We also compared CCT versus inactive control (no interventions). Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. We found no studies on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. In terms of our secondary outcomes, trial results suggest slight improvement in episodic memory (mean difference (MD) ‐0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.73 to ‐0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence) and no effect on executive function (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low‐quality evidence), working memory (MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence), or verbal fluency (MD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing at trial endpoints because the evidence was of very low quality. We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison. Authors' conclusions We found little evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of CCT improves cognition in healthy older adults. However, our limited confidence in the results reflects the overall quality of the evidence. Inconsistency between trials was a major limitation. In five of the eight trials, the duration of intervention was just three months. The possibility that longer periods of training could be beneficial remains to be more fully explored. Plain language summary Computerised cognitive training for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life Background The terms 'cognition' and 'cognitive function' describe all of the mental activities related to thinking, learning, remembering, and communicating. There are normal changes in cognition with aging. There are also diseases that affect cognition, principally dementia, which becomes increasingly common with increasing age from about 65 years onwards. Researchers have showed a great deal of interest in trying to prevent cognitive decline and dementia. It is known that being mentally active throughout life is associated with lower risk of dementia. Therefore, it has been suggested that encouraging mental activity might be an effective way of maintaining good cognitive function as people age. Cognitive training comprises a set of standardised tasks intended to 'exercise the brain' in various ways. Programmes of cognitive training are often delivered by computers or mobile technology, so that people can do this training on their own at home. Increasingly, these are available as commercial packages that are advertised to the general public. We wanted to know whether computerised cognitive training (CCT) is an effective way for people aged 65 and older to maintain good cognitive function as they age. What we did We searched the medical literature up to 15 March 2018 for trials that compared the cognitive function of people aged 65 or older who had taken part in computerised cognitive training lasting at least three months against a control group that had not done so. All participants should have been cognitively healthy at the start of the trials. For the comparison to be as fair as possible, it should have been decided randomly whether participants were in the cognitive training group or in the control group. We were primarily interested in overall measures of cognition. The choice of three months for the intervention was somewhat arbitrary, but we thought it unlikely that shorter periods of training could have long‐lasting effects. What we found We found eight trials with a total of 1183 participants to include in the review. Four trials provided CCT for three months. The longest duration of training was six months. We compared CCT with other activities, such as watching educational videos, and with no activity at all. We looked for effects on overall cognitive function and on specific cognitive functions, such as memory and thinking speed. All of the studies had some design problems, which could have biased the results. Results show a lot of inconsistency between different trials. Overall, we thought the quality of the evidence found was low or very low. This means that we cannot be confident in the results, and that more research might well find something different. We either were unable to comment or found no evidence of an effect of CCT on overall cognitive function or on most of the specific cognitive functions that we examined. The longest trial also found that compared to doing nothing, completing six months of CCT may have had a beneficial effect on memory. None of the trials reported effects on quality of life or on daily activities, and none reported harmful effects of training. Our conclusions It is not yet possible to say for certain whether or not computerised cognitive training can help older people to maintain good cognitive function. Although we excluded very short trials (< 3 months) from this review, the trials that we found were still quite short for examining long‐term effects as people age. We think it is important to do more research to find out whether longer periods of training work better, and whether training can produce lasting effects.

AB: Abstract - Background Delirium is defined as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition with reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention, and reduced orientation to the environment. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long‐term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society. Objectives To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in‐hospital mortality, the number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days, ventilator‐free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018). Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. Data collection and analysis We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta‐analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively. Main results The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non‐pharmacologic intervention. Haloperidol versus placebo (two RCTs, 1580 participants) The event rate of ICU delirium was measured in one study including 1439 participants. No difference was identified between groups, (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.17) (moderate‐quality evidence). Haloperidol versus placebo neither reduced or increased in‐hospital mortality, (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 2 studies; 1580 participants (moderate‐quality evidence)); the number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days, (mean difference (MD) ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.37 to 0.17; 2 studies, 1580 participants (moderate‐quality of evidence)); number of ventilator‐free days (mean 23.8 (MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.93 to 0.33) 1 study; 1439 participants, (high‐quality evidence)); length of ICU stay, (MD 0.18, 95% CI ­0.60 to 0.97); 2 studies, 1580 participants; high‐quality evidence). None of the studies measured cognitive impairment. In one study there were three serious adverse events in the intervention group and five in the placebo group; in the other there were five serious adverse events and three patients died, one in each group. None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to interventions received (moderate‐quality evidence). Physical and cognitive therapy interventions (one study, 65 participants) The study did not measure the event rate of ICU delirium. A physical and cognitive therapy intervention versus standard care neither reduced nor increased in‐hospital mortality, (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.20, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence); the number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days, (MD ‐2.8, 95% CI ‐10.1 to 4.6, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence); the number of ventilator‐free days (within the first 28/30 days) was median 27.4 (IQR 0 to 29.2) and 25 (IQR 0 to 28.9); 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence, length of ICU stay, (MD 1.23, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 3.14, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence); cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE: Mini‐Mental State Examination with higher scores indicating better function, (MD 0.97, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 2.13, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low‐quality evidence); or measured by the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) with lower scores indicating better function (MD ‐8.76, 95% CI ‐19.06 to 1.54, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low‐quality evidence). One patient experienced acute back pain accompanied by hypotensive urgency during physical therapy. Authors' conclusions There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future. Plain language summary Intervention to prevent delirium for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) Background Delirium is an acutely disturbed state of mind that occurs in critically ill adults in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated with a prolonged time on mechanical ventilation to assist breathing, longer stay in the ICU and hospital, and higher risk of death. ICU delirium is also linked with cognitive problems such as loss of memory and attention, difficulty in concentrating and reduced awareness. The risk factors for delirium include old age, alcoholism, vision/hearing impairment and, for critically ill patients, the use of restraints, prolonged pain and some medications. Review question Our aim was to assess the existing evidence on the effect of interventions for preventing ICU delirium, reducing in‐hospital death, reducing length of coma/delirium, the need for mechanical ventilation to assist breathing, the length of stay in the ICU and mental problems Study characteristics We included 12 randomized controlled trials (3885 participants) in our review. The studies included adults aged 48 to 70 years from surgical and medical ICUs. The studies compared different drugs (three studies) various approaches to sedation (five studies), physical or cognitive therapy or both (one study), noise and light reduction in the ICU (two studies), and preventive nursing care (one study). The studies had mostly small numbers of participants and did not blind the researchers who assessed effects on outcomes. We report the findings regarding the effect of the two most commonly explored approaches for preventing delirium, drug and non‐drug interventions, haloperidol versus a sham drug, and early physical and cognitive therapy versus usual care. Key results Our findings suggest that there may be little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium, but further studies are needed to reduce imprecision and increase our confidence in the findings. More studies of physical and cognitive therapy are needed as there is insufficient evidence to determine whether these non‐pharmacological approaches can prevent delirium in the ICU. Additional research is required to explore the benefits and harms of other approaches to prevent delirium in the ICU such as sedation and changes in the ICU environment, and nursing care tailored to prevent delirium. Quality of the evidence We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate to very low. Several studies had quality shortcomings, including their use of small numbers of participants, and lack of blinding of those assessing effects of interventions for preventing delirium and other outcomes. For the interventions testing sedation approaches, physical and cognitive therapy, and changes in the environment, additional research is required to clarify their effectiveness. The five studies in ‘Studies awaiting classification’ and 15 ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once they are completed and assessed.

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an evidence‐based treatment for anxiety disorders. Many people have difficulty accessing treatment, due to a variety of obstacles. Researchers have therefore explored the possibility of using the Internet to deliver CBT; it is important to ensure the decision to promote such treatment is grounded in high quality evidence. Objectives To assess the effects of therapist‐supported Internet CBT (ICBT) on remission of anxiety disorder diagnosis and reduction of anxiety symptoms in adults as compared to waiting list control, unguided CBT, or face‐to‐face CBT. Effects of treatment on quality of life and patient satisfaction with the intervention were also assessed. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 16 March 2015. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL. We also searched online clinical trial registries and reference lists of included studies. We contacted authors to locate additional trials. Selection criteria Each identified study was independently assessed for inclusion by two authors. To be included, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of therapist‐supported ICBT compared to a waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group; unguided CBT (that is, self‐help); or face‐to‐face CBT. We included studies that treated adults with an anxiety disorder (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, post‐traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and specific phobia) defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, III‐R, IV, IV‐TR or the International Classification of Disesases 9 or 10. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and judged overall study quality. We used data from intention‐to‐treat analyses wherever possible. We assessed treatment effect for the dichotomous outcome of clinically important improvement in anxiety using a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For disorder‐specific and general anxiety symptom measures and quality of life we assessed continuous scores using standardized mean differences (SMD). We examined statistical heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic. Main results We screened 1736 citations and selected 38 studies (3214 participants) for inclusion. The studies examined social phobia (11 trials), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (8 trials), generalized anxiety disorder (5 trials), post‐traumatic stress disorder (2 trials), obsessive compulsive disorder (2 trials), and specific phobia (2 trials). Eight remaining studies included a range of anxiety disorder diagnoses. Studies were conducted in Sweden (18 trials), Australia (14 trials), Switzerland (3 trials), the Netherlands (2 trials), and the USA (1 trial) and investigated a variety of ICBT protocols. Three primary comparisons were identified, therapist‐supported ICBT versus waiting list control, therapist‐supported versus unguided ICBT, and therapist‐supported ICBT versus face‐to‐face CBT. Low quality evidence from 11 studies (866 participants) contributed to a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 3.75 (95% CI 2.51 to 5.60; I 2  = 50%) for clinically important improvement in anxiety at post‐treatment, favouring therapist‐supported ICBT over a waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group only. The SMD for disorder‐specific symptoms at post‐treatment (28 studies, 2147 participants; SMD ‐1.06, 95% CI ‐1.29 to ‐0.82; I 2  = 83%) and general anxiety symptoms at post‐treatment (19 studies, 1496 participants; SMD ‐0.75, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.52; I 2  = 78%) favoured therapist‐supported ICBT; the quality of the evidence for both outcomes was low. One study compared unguided CBT to therapist‐supported ICBT for clinically important improvement in anxiety at post‐treatment, showing no difference in outcome between treatments (54 participants; very low quality evidence). At post‐treatment there were no clear differences between unguided CBT and therapist‐supported ICBT for disorder‐specific anxiety symptoms (5 studies, 312 participants; SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.56 to 0.13; I 2  = 58%; very low quality evidence) or general anxiety symptoms (2 studies, 138 participants; SMD 0.28, 95% CI ‐2.21 to 2.78; I 2  = 0%; very low quality evidence). Compared to face‐to‐face CBT, therapist‐supported ICBT showed no significant differences in clinically important improvement in anxiety at post‐treatment (4 studies, 365 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34; I 2  = 0%; low quality evidence). There were also no clear differences between face‐to‐face and therapist supported ICBT for disorder‐specific anxiety symptoms at post‐treatment (7 studies, 450 participants; SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.25 to 0.37; I 2  = 60%; low quality evidence) or general anxiety symptoms at post‐treatment (5 studies, 317 participants; SMD 0.17, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.69; I 2  = 78%; low quality evidence). Overall, risk of bias in included studies was low or unclear for most domains. However, due to the nature of psychosocial intervention trials, blinding of participants and personnel, and outcome assessment tended to have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity across a number of the meta‐analyses was substantial, some was explained by type of anxiety disorder or may be meta‐analytic measurement artefact due to combining many assessment measures. Adverse events were rarely reported. Authors' conclusions Therapist‐supported ICBT appears to be an efficacious treatment for anxiety in adults. The evidence comparing therapist‐supported ICBT to waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group only control was low to moderate quality, the evidence comparing therapist‐supported ICBT to unguided ICBT was very low quality, and comparisons of therapist‐supported ICBT to face‐to‐face CBT were low quality. Further research is needed to better define and measure any potential harms resulting from treatment. These findings suggest that therapist‐supported ICBT is more efficacious than a waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group only control, and that there may not be a significant difference in outcome between unguided CBT and therapist‐supported ICBT; however, this latter finding must be interpreted with caution due to imprecision. The evidence suggests that therapist‐supported ICBT may not be significantly different from face‐to‐face CBT in reducing anxiety. Future research should explore heterogeneity among studies which is reducing the quality of the evidence body, involve equivalence trials comparing ICBT and face‐to‐face CBT, examine the importance of the role of the therapist in ICBT, and include effectiveness trials of ICBT in real‐world settings. A timely update to this review is needed given the fast pace of this area of research. Plain language summary Internet‐based cognitive behavioural therapy with therapist support for anxiety in adults: a review of the evidence Who may be interested in this review? People who suffer from anxiety and their families. General Practitioners. Professionals working in psychological therapy services. Developers of Internet‐based therapies for mental health problems. Why is this review important? Many adults suffer from anxiety disorders, which have a significant impact on their everyday lives. Anxiety disorders often result in high healthcare costs and high costs to society due to absence from work and reduced quality of life. Research has shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment which helps to reduce anxiety. However, many people are not able to access face‐to‐face CBT due to long waiting lists, lack of available time for appointments, transportation problems, and limited numbers of qualified therapists. Internet‐based CBT (ICBT) provides a possible solution to overcome many of the barriers to accessing face‐to‐face therapy. Therapists can provide support to patients who are accessing Internet‐based therapy by telephone or e‐mail. It is hoped that this will provide a way of increasing access to CBT, particularly for people who live in rural areas. It is not yet known whether ICBT with therapist support is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review aims to summarise current research to find out whether ICBT with therapist support is an effective treatment for anxiety. The review aims to answer the following questions: ‐ is ICBT with therapist support more effective than no treatment (waiting list)? ‐ how effective is ICBT with therapist support compared with face‐to‐face CBT? ‐ how effective is ICBT with therapist support compared with unguided CBT (self‐help with no therapist input)? ‐ what is the quality of current research on ICBT with therapist support for anxiety? Which studies were included in the review? Databases were searched to find all high quality studies of ICBT with therapist support for anxiety published until March 2015. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials involving adults over 18 years with a main diagnosis of an anxiety disorder; 38 studies with a total of 3214 participants were included in the review. What does the evidence from the review tell us? ICBT with therapist support was significantly more effective than no treatment (waiting list) at improving anxiety and reducing symptoms. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of ICBT with therapist support and unguided CBT, though the quality of the evidence was very low. Patient satisfaction was generally reported to be higher with therapist‐supported ICBT, however patient satisfaction was not formally assessed. ICBT with therapist support may not differ in effectiveness as compared to face‐to‐face CBT. The quality of the evidence was low. There was a low risk of bias in the included studies, except for blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment. Adverse events were rarely reported in the studies.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression. Objectives 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies. 2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)‐Europe E‐theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the "Awaiting classification" section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic. Main results We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta‐analysis examining short‐term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate‐quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician‐rated depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.69 to ‐0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.85, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low‐quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate‐quality evidence). Findings of the present meta‐analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short‐term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician‐rated depression (SMD ‐0.78, 95% CI ‐2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low‐quality evidence), patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐1.28, 95% CI ‐3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low‐quality evidence), quality of life (SMD ‐1.31, 95% CI ‐ 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low‐quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate‐quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician‐rated depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), quality of life (SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety. Authors' conclusions Findings of the present meta‐analysis indicate that music therapy provides short‐term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression. It is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes. Plain language summary Music therapy for depression Why is this review important? Depression is a common problem that causes changes in mood and loss of interest and pleasure. Music therapy, an intervention that involves regular meetings with a qualified music therapist, may help in improving mood through emotional expression. This review might add new information about effects of music therapy in depressed individuals. Who will be interested in this review? Our review will be of interest for the following people: people with depression and their families, friends, and carers; general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other professionals working in mental health; music therapists working in mental health; and mental health policy makers. What questions does this review aim to answer? 1. Is music therapy more effective than treatment as usual alone or psychological therapy? 2. Is any form of music therapy better than another form of music therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We included nine studies with a total of 421 people of any age group (from adolescents to older people). Studies compared effects of music therapy versus treatment as usual, and versus psychological therapy. Additionally, we examined the differences between two different forms of music therapy: active (where people sing or play music) and receptive (where people listen to music). What does evidence from the review tell us? We found that music therapy plus treatment as usual is more effective than treatment as usual alone. Music therapy seems to reduce depressive symptoms and anxiety and helps to improve functioning (e.g. maintaining involvement in job, activities, and relationships). We are not sure whether music therapy is better than psychological therapy. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another. The small numbers of identified studies and participants make it hard to be confident about these comparisons. What should happen next? Music therapy for depression is likely to be effective for people in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Music therapy also helps people to function in their everyday life. However, our findings are not complete and need to be clarified through additional research. Future trials should study depression in children and adolescents, and future trial reports should thoroughly describe music therapy interventions, other interventions, and the person who delivers these interventions.

AB: Abstract - Background Non‐compliance is a significant problem among people with serious mental disorders, presenting a challenge for mental health professionals. Prompts such as telephone calls, visits, and a posted referral letter to patients are currently used to encourage patient attendance at clinics and/or compliance with medication. More recently, the use of information and communication technology (ICT)‐based prompting methods have increased. Methods include mobile text message (SMS ‐ short message service), e‐mail or use of any other electronic device with the stated purpose of encouraging compliance. Objectives To investigate the effects of ICT‐based prompting to support treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness compared with standard care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (31 st  May 2011 and 9 th  July 2012) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. Also, we inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria Relevant randomised controlled trials involving adults with serious mental illness, comparing any ICT‐based prompt or combination of prompts by automatic or semi‐automatic system compared with standard care. Data collection and analysis Review authors reliably assessed trial quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups, again with 95% confidence intervals. A 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE was created, and we assessed included studies for risk of bias. Main results The search identified 35 references, with 25 studies, but we could only include two studies with a total of 358 participants. The studies had a moderate risk of bias, and therefore risk overestimating any positive effects of ICT‐based prompting. Both included studies compared semi‐automatised ICT‐based prompting intervention with standard care groups in mental health outpatient care. The interventions were SMS‐message and an electronic assistant device. One included study reported our primary outcome, compliance. There was not any clear evidence that ICT‐based prompts increase improvement in compliance (stop taking medication within six months n = 320, RR 1.11 CI 0.96 to 1.29,  moderate quality evidence ). There was some low quality evidence that ICT‐based prompts have small effects for: mental state (average change in specific symptom scores within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.30 CI ‐0.53 to ‐0.07; severity of illness within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.07 and six months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.07; average change in depressive scores within six months n = 251, RR 0.00 CI ‐0.28 to 0.28; global symptoms within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.07; negative symptoms within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.38 to 0.18 and six months n = 251, MD ‐0.30 CI ‐0.58 to 0.02,  low quality evidence).  Level of insight improved more among people receiving ICT‐based prompt compared with those in the control group at six months (n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.07). ICT‐based prompts also increased quality of life (average change in quality of life within six months n = 251, RR 0.50 CI 0.19 to 0.81,  moderate quality evidence ). Based on the existing data, there is no evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other (n = 347, 2 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.70 to 3.05,  low quality evidence ). Included studies did not report outcomes of service utilisation, behaviour, costs or adverse events. Authors' conclusions The evidence base on the effects of ICT‐based prompts is still inconclusive. Data to clarify ICT‐based prompting effects are awaited from an ongoing trial, but further well‐conducted trials considering the different ICT‐based prompts are warranted. Plain language summary Using information and communication‐based prompting for patients with serious mental illness Recently there has been an increase in the use of ICT (Information Communication Technology) for the delivery of information to people with severe mental illness. ICT is considered to be any technical means of delivering information and communication and can include use of telephones, television, radio, computers and hand‐held devices. People with severe mental health problems often have difficulties with 'treatment compliance' i.e. following their treatment programme. They can have difficulty remembering to take medication or appointment times. Unpleasant side effects of medication can also lead to people stopping medication, and a lack of insight into their illness can mean they do not see the need to follow treatments. Non‐compliance with treatment can lead to poor health outcomes and even relapses and hospitalisation. There are several methods healthcare professionals use to help people with serious mental illness improve compliance; once such method is prompting. The purpose of prompting is to help patients to follow the treatment instructions and keep the treatment appointment times by using reminders via telephone calls, personal visits or posted referral letter. More recently, Information and technology‐based prompts are being used. This review investigates the effectiveness of ICT‐based prompts in order to support treatment compliance among patients with serious mental illness. A search for randomised controlled trials was run in 2012. Two trials that compared the use of ICT prompting compared with standard care could be included. Review authors rated the quality of data in these as 'moderate' or 'low'. Because of the small amount of data, it is impossible to say whether ICT‐based prompts are effective. Only one trial measured medication compliance. The study suggested that ICT‐based prompts may help people take their medication, but clear evidence of a benefit is missing. There were some positive effects for patient insight. However, insight was only better in the medium term and appeared to show no difference in the short term. Further, some positive effect was found in patient satisfaction with treatment, although the results for the analyses were imprecise. Also, mental state and quality of life showed minor improvement. There were no clear evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other. Outcomes such as service use, behaviour, costs or adverse effects were not presented in the studies. There is an ongoing trial, but additional well‐conducted trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. Search methods We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. Selection criteria RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. Main results We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption. Plain language summary Consultation letters for use by primary care physicians in their care of patients with physical symptoms for which no organic cause can be found In 10% to 35% of all consultations in primary care, no organic cause can be found for the physical symptoms of the patient. Patients may present with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, non‐specific low back pain and chest pain. Such symptoms can lead to frequent consultations with the physician and high medical costs as well as causing considerable worry and disability for the patient. Patients suffering from MUPS are more likely than the average patient to experience depressive and anxiety disorders. Studies have reported positive effects of screening by a psychiatrist in the treatment of MUPS in primary care. After screening, the psychiatrist sends the primary care physician a 'consultation letter' (CL) which states the diagnosis and that patients are best helped by: 1) having their symptoms taken seriously; 2) not being told their symptoms are 'all in your head'; 3) not being referred for further investigation unless there is a clear indication of a somatic disorder; 4) undergoing a physical examination at each visit; and 5) being seen at regular intervals. In our review we found six studies, with a total of 449 patients, in which one of two interventions were applied. One intervention (four studies, 267 patients) was a CL following a consultation between the patient and the psychiatrist; the other (two studies, 182 patients) was a CL following a joint consultation between patient, psychiatrist and primary care physician. In each case comparison was against care as usual, provided by the primary care physician. The first intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (three studies) and improved physical functioning (three studies). We found evidence for a slight reduction in the severity of the MUPS, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning following the second intervention, although in only one of two studies assessed. There are serious limitations in generalizability of the results to modern healthcare: most trials reported doctor‐related outcomes with patient‐related outcomes varying in results; the intervention appears to be far more effective for the most serious but rare disorders, and less so in the more common forms of MUPS; five of the six studies were performed in the United States and four studies before 1995. Furthermore the studied populations were small and five of the six studies were of moderate quality. Our final conclusion is that CLs may be helpful for physicians who treat patients with MUPS (based on the provider‐related outcomes). However, until further studies are conducted to find out if the intervention results in improved patient‐related outcomes, the overall effectiveness of CLs cannot be demonstrated.

AB: Abstract - Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been recognised as a global health concern, and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Projections of the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that prevalence rates of COPD continue to increase, and by 2030, it will become the world's third leading cause of death. Depression is a major comorbidity amongst patients with COPD, with an estimate prevalence of up to 80% in severe stages of COPD. Prevalence studies show that patients who have COPD are four times as likely to develop depression compared to those without COPD. Regrettably, they rarely receive appropriate treatment for COPD‐related depression. Available findings from trials indicate that untreated depression is associated with worse compliance with medical treatment, poor quality of life, increased mortality rates, increased hospital admissions and readmissions, prolonged length of hospital stay, and subsequently, increased costs to the healthcare system. Given the burden and high prevalence of untreated depression, it is important to evaluate and update existing experimental evidence using rigorous methodology, and to identify effective psychological therapies for patients with COPD‐related depression. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2018, Issue 11), and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from June 2016 to 26 November 2018. Previously these databases were searched via the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups' Specialised Trials Registers (all years to June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 26 November 2018 to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Additionally, the grey literature databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full‐text screening were also searched. Selection criteria Eligible for inclusion were randomised controlled trials that compared the use of psychological therapies with either no intervention, education, or combined with a co‐intervention and compared with the same co‐intervention in a population of patients with COPD whose depressive symptoms were measured before or at baseline assessment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts identified by the search to determine which studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We assessed two primary outcomes: depressive symptoms and adverse events; and the following secondary outcomes: quality of life, dyspnoea, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), exercise tolerance, hospital length of stay or readmission rate, and cost‐effectiveness. Potentially eligible full‐text articles were also independently assessed by two review authors. A PRISMA flow diagram was prepared to demonstrate the decision process in detail. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' evaluation tool to examine the risk of bias, and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. All outcomes were continuous, therefore, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random‐effects model to calculate treatment effects. Main results The findings are based on 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 1500 participants. In some of the included studies, the investigators did not recruit participants with clinically confirmed depression but applied screening criteria after randomisation. Hence, across the studies, baseline scores for depressive symptoms varied from no symptoms to severe depression. The severity of COPD across the studies was moderate to severe. Primary outcomes There was a small effect showing the effectiveness of psychological therapies in improving depressive symptoms when compared to no intervention (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.33; P = 0.009; 6 studies, 764 participants), or to education (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.41; P = 0.010; 3 studies, 507 participants). Two studies compared psychological therapies plus a co‐intervention versus the co‐intervention alone (i.e. pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)). The results suggest that a psychological therapy combined with a PR programme can reduce depressive symptoms more than a PR programme alone (SMD 0.37, 95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.74; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 112 participants). We rated the quality of evidence as very low. Owing to the nature of psychological therapies, blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment was a concern. None of the included studies measured adverse events. Secondary outcomes Quality of life was measured in four studies in the comparison with no intervention, and in three studies in the comparison with education. We found inconclusive results for improving quality of life. However, when we pooled data from two studies using the same measure, the result suggested that psychological therapy improved quality of life better than no intervention. One study measured hospital admission rates and cost‐effectiveness and showed significant reductions in the intervention group compared to the education group. We rated the quality of evidence as very low for the secondary outcomes. Authors' conclusions The findings from this review indicate that psychological therapies (using a CBT‐based approach) may be effective for treating COPD‐related depression, but the evidence is limited. Depressive symptoms improved more in the intervention groups compared to: 1) no intervention (attention placebo or standard care), 2) educational interventions, and 3) a co‐intervention (pulmonary rehabilitation). However, the effect sizes were small and quality of the evidence very low due to clinical heterogeneity and risk of bias. This means that more experimental studies with larger numbers of participants are needed, to confirm the potential beneficial effects of therapies with a CBT approach for COPD‐related depression. New trials should also address the gap in knowledge related to limited data on adverse effects, and the secondary outcomes of quality of life, dyspnoea, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), exercise tolerance, hospital length of stay and frequency of readmissions, and cost‐effectiveness. Also, new research studies need to adhere to robust methodology to produce higher quality evidence. Plain language summary Are psychological therapies effective in treating depression in patients with COPD? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comprises two conditions: emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It has been recognised as a serious health problem and one of the main causes of death around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) informs that the number of people with COPD continues to grow, and by 2030, COPD will become the world's third cause of death. Most of the people who have COPD also experience depression. Studies show that up to 80% of patients with more severe COPD can have symptoms of depression. Other findings show that patients with COPD are four times more likely to have depression than those without COPD. Why is this review important? The number of people living with COPD is increasing, rather than decreasing, around the world. Depression in this population is commonly unrecognised, and patients rarely receive appropriate treatment. Untreated depression increases the risk of death, hospitalisation, readmissions, and healthcare costs. Currently, there is no strong evidence showing which psychological therapy is most effective for patients with COPD and depression. Who will be interested in this review? People who have COPD and depression, respiratory physicians, mental health specialists, respiratory nurses, other healthcare professionals, and policy makers. What questions does this review aim to answer? Which psychological therapy (if any) is effective in reducing symptoms of depression in patients with COPD? Which studies were included in the review? This review included experimental studies, called randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with participants who had diagnosed COPD. What does the evidence from the review tell us? This review included 13 experimental studies (RCTs) with 1500 participants. Our main result shows that psychological therapies using cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) approach may, potentially, be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with COPD. However, the quality of this evidence is very low because of many limitations related to the way the studies were conducted. What should happen next? More experimental studies with larger numbers of participants are needed, to confirm beneficial effects of CBT for patients with COPD‐related depression. Future studies need to produce higher quality evidence and measure adverse events and other important outcomes, such as quality of life or cost‐effectiveness.

AB: Abstract - Background Paliperidone palmitate, a long‐acting, intramuscular formulation of paliperidone, is now available for clinical use. Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone and it is also available in an oral formulation for daily use. Objectives To compare the effects of paliperidone palmitate with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2009) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone palmitate, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to benefit/harm statistic (NNB/H). We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous data. Main results Five studies with 2215 participants compared paliperidone palmitate with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone palmitate (n = 2183, 5 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.70 to 0.84, NNTB 9 CI 7 to 14) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to show no improvement in global state (n = 1696, 4 RCTs, RR 0.79 CI 0.74 to 0.85, NNTB 7 CI 5 to 9). People randomised to paliperidone palmitate were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n = 312, 1 RCT, RR 0.28 CI 0.17 to 0.48, NNTB 5 CI 4 to 6) than those allocated to placebo in a single trial specifically designed to study recurrence. In the other studies where recurrence was recorded only as an adverse event, we found that people who received paliperidone palmitate were also less likely to experience a recurrence of psychotic symptoms (n = 1837, 4 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.44 to 0.68, NNTB 10 CI 8 to 14).  Paliperidone palmitate was associated with fewer reports of agitation or aggression (n = 2180, 5 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.46 to 0.91, NNTB 39 CI 25 to 150) and of using anxiolytic medications (n = 2170, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.83 to 0.96, NNTB 16 CI 11 to 44). A consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) was found for both men and women receiving paliperidone palmitate, but the data were too heterogenous to sum. We found no evidence of sexual dysfunction in these short‐term trials. People receiving paliperidone palmitate had a significantly greater increase in weight (n = 2052, 5 RCTs, MD 1.34 CI 0.97 to 1.70) in comparison with people who received placebo. Two studies with 1969 participants compared flexibly‐dosed paliperidone palmitate with flexibly‐dosed risperidone long‐acting injection. The mean doses of paliperidone palmitate in these trials were 73.3 and 104.6 mg every four weeks compared with risperidone long‐acting injection at mean doses, respectively, of 35.3 and 31.7 mg every two weeks. We found no differences between paliperidone palmitate and risperidone long‐acting injection for leaving these studies early for any reason (n = 1969, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 1.00 to 1.25). Those receiving paliperidone palmitate were statistically no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving risperidone long‐acting injection (n = 1961, 2 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 0.98 to 1.53). While we found no significant difference in the occurrences of deaths in the pooled trials (n = 1967, 2 RCTs, RR 3.62 CI 0.60 to 21.89), we note that a total of six deaths occurred in these two trials, with five deaths among people who received paliperidone palmitate and one death among people who received risperidone long‐acting injection. Although death is the most serious of adverse events, the small number of these events in these trials makes it unclear if this finding is meaningful. We found that participants randomised to paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to use anticholinergic medications in these trials (n = 1587, 2 RCTs, RR 0.67 CI 0.55 to 0.82, NNTB 13 CI 10 to 24).     We found no data regarding paliperidone palmitate relating to services use, quality of life, behaviour, patient satisfaction, cognitive functioning or cost. Authors' conclusions In short‐term studies, paliperidone palmitate is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its related compounds, paliperidone and risperidone, with extrapyramidal movement disorders, weight gain, and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone palmitate than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone palmitate is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When flexibly dosed with a mean doses of approximately 70 to 110 mg every four weeks, paliperidone palmitate appears comparable in efficacy and tolerability to risperidone long‐acting injection flexibly dosed with mean doses of approximately 35 mg every two weeks.   Plain language summary Paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia Paliperidone palmitate is a long‐acting intramuscular formulation of paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone that was previously available only in an oral formulation. We evaluated the efficacy, adverse effects, and safety of paliperidone palmitate in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. In short‐term studies, paliperidone palmitate is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone palmitate are similar to those of oral paliperidone, oral risperidone, and risperidone long‐acting injection. In two short‐term studies, flexibly‐dosed paliperidone palmitate is roughly equivalent in efficacy and tolerability to flexibly‐dosed risperidone long‐acting injection.

AB: Abstract - Background Executive functions are the controlling mechanisms of the brain and include the processes of planning, initiation, organisation, inhibition, problem solving, self monitoring and error correction. They are essential for goal‐oriented behaviour and responding to new and novel situations. A high number of people with acquired brain injury, including around 75% of stroke survivors, will experience executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction reduces capacity to regain independence in activities of daily living (ADL), particularly when alternative movement strategies are necessary to compensate for limb weakness. Improving executive function may lead to increased independence with ADL. There are various cognitive rehabilitation strategies for training executive function used within clinical practice and it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these interventions. Objectives To determine the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on executive dysfunction for adults with stroke or other non‐progressive acquired brain injuries. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , August 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012), EMBASE (1980 to August 2012), CINAHL (1982 to August 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to August 2012), AMED (1985 to August 2012) and 11 additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts. Selection criteria We included randomised trials in adults after non‐progressive acquired brain injury, where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving cognition including separable executive function data (restorative interventions), where the intervention was aimed at training participants in methods to compensate for lost executive function (compensative interventions) or where the intervention involved the training in the use of an adaptive technique for improving independence with ADL (adaptive interventions). The primary outcome was global executive function and the secondary outcomes were specific components of executive function, working memory, ADL, extended ADL, quality of life and participation in vocational activities. We included studies in which the comparison intervention was no treatment, a placebo intervention (i.e. a rehabilitation intervention that should not impact on executive function), standard care or another cognitive rehabilitation intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, method of dealing with missing data and other potential sources of bias. Main results Nineteen studies (907 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. We included 13 studies (770 participants) in meta‐analyses (417 traumatic brain injury, 304 stroke, 49 other acquired brain injury) reducing to 660 participants once non‐included intervention groups were removed from three and four group studies. We were unable to obtain data from the remaining six studies. Three studies (134 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with sensorimotor therapy. None reported our primary outcome; data from one study was available relating to secondary outcomes including concept formation and ADL. Six studies (333 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with no treatment or placebo. None reported our primary outcome; data from four studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation on secondary outcomes. Ten studies (448 participants) compared two different cognitive rehabilitation approaches. Two studies (82 participants) reported the primary outcome; no statistically significant effect was found. Data from eight studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect on the secondary outcomes. We explored the effect of restorative interventions (10 studies, 468 participants) and compensative interventions (four studies, 128 participants) and found no statistically significant effect compared with other interventions. Authors' conclusions We identified insufficient high‐quality evidence to reach any generalised conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on executive function, or other secondary outcome measures. Further high‐quality research comparing cognitive rehabilitation with no intervention, placebo or sensorimotor interventions is recommended. Plain language summary Cognitive rehabilitation for executive function problems after brain injury Executive function is the term used to describe the brain processes that we use to organise ourselves and solve problems. Executive function is frequently affected when the brain is damaged through trauma or from an internal cause such as a stroke. It has been estimated that around 75% of people will have executive function difficulties after a stroke. People with executive function difficulties (executive dysfunction) often find it difficult to learn new ways of doing daily activities, such as dressing themselves. This can make it very difficult for them to learn ways to deal with other problems, such as movement difficulties, which also occur as a result of their brain injury. Cognitive rehabilitation is a type of therapy that aims to improve people's attention, memory or executive function. If it is possible to improve executive function, then more people with brain injury might become more independent with activities of daily living, and might respond better to their rehabilitation. We investigated how effective cognitive rehabilitation interventions are at improving executive function after brain injury. We found 19 relevant studies involving 907 people. We were able to combine the results of 13 of these studies including 660 participants (395 traumatic brain injury, 234 stroke, 31 other acquired brain injury). Only two of the studies (82 people) reported the outcome in which we were most interested (a general measure of executive function). We found no evidence that cognitive rehabilitation interventions were helpful for people with executive dysfunction for any other outcomes. We recommend that more research is carried out to determine whether cognitive rehabilitation can improve executive function after stroke and brain injury.

AB: Abstract - Background Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder affecting a person's mind, behaviour and body. It is expressed as a variety of symptoms and is associated with substantial impairment. Despite a range of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment options, there is still room for improvement of the pharmacological treatment of depression in terms of efficacy and tolerability. The latest available antidepressant is vortioxetine. It is assumed that vortioxetine's antidepressant action is related to a direct modulation of serotonergic receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin transporter. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is claimed to be novel. Vortioxetine was placed in the category of "Other" antidepressants and may therefore provide an alternative to existing antidepressant drugs. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of vortioxetine compared with placebo and other antidepressant drugs in the treatment of acute depression in adults. Search methods We searched Cochrane's Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register to May 2016 without applying any restrictions to date, language or publication status. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, regulatory agency reports and trial databases. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy, tolerability, or both of vortioxetine versus placebo or any other antidepressant agent in the treatment of acute depression in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the studies and extracted data. We extracted data on study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. We analysed intention‐to‐treat (ITT) data only and used risk ratios (RR) as effect sizes for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta‐analyses used random‐effects models. Main results We included 15 studies (7746 participants) in this review. Seven studies were placebo controlled; eight studies compared vortioxetine to serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We were unable to identify any study that compared vortioxetine to antidepressant drugs from other classes, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Vortioxetine may be more effective than placebo across the three efficacy outcomes: response (Mantel‐Haenszel RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49; 14 studies, 6220 participants), remission (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.53; 14 studies, 6220 participants) and depressive symptoms measured using the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Scale (MADRS) (score range: 0 to 34; higher score means worse outcome: MD ‐2.94, 95% CI ‐4.07 to ‐1.80; 14 studies, 5566 participants). The quality of the evidence was low for response and remission and very low for depressive symptoms. We found no evidence of a difference in total dropout rates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19; 14 studies, 6220 participants). More participants discontinued vortioxetine than placebo because of adverse effects (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81; 14 studies, 6220 participants) but fewer discontinued due to inefficacy (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.90, P = 0.02; 14 studies, 6220 participants). The quality of the evidence for dropouts was moderate.The subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not reveal factors that significantly influenced the results. In comparison with other antidepressants, very low‐quality evidence from eight studies showed no clinically significant difference between vortioxetine and SNRIs as a class for response (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00; 3159 participants) or remission (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03; 3155 participants). There was a small difference favouring SNRIs for depressive symptom scores on the MADRS (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.53; 8 studies, 2807 participants). Very low quality evidence from eight studies (3159 participants) showed no significant differences between vortioxetine and the SNRIs as a class for total dropout rates (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.08), dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) and dropouts due to inefficacy (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.30). Against individual antidepressants, analyses suggested that vortioxetine may be less effective than duloxetine in terms of response rates (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94; 6 studies, 2392 participants) and depressive symptoms scores on the MADRS scale (MD 1.99, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.83; 6 studies; 2106 participants). Against venlafaxine, meta‐analysis of two studies found no statistically significant differences (response: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 767 participants; depressive symptom scores: MD 0.02, 95% CI ‐2.49 to 2.54; 701 participants). In terms of number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect (tolerability), vortioxetine was better than the SNRIs as a class (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.94; 8 studies, 3134 participants) and duloxetine (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.95; 6 studies; 2376 participants). However, the sensitivity analysis casts some doubts on this result, as only two studies used comparable dosing. We judged none of the studies to have a high risk of bias for any domain, but we rated all studies to have an unclear risk of bias of selective reporting and other biases. Authors' conclusions The place of vortioxetine in the treatment of acute depression is unclear. Our analyses showed vortioxetine may be more effective than placebo in terms of response, remission and depressive symptoms, but the clinical relevance of these effects is uncertain. Furthermore, the quality of evidence to support these findings was generally low. In comparison to SNRIs, we found no advantage for vortioxetine. Vortioxetine was less effective than duloxetine, but fewer people reported adverse effects when treated with vortioxetine compared to duloxetine. However, these findings are uncertain and not well supported by evidence. A major limitation of the current evidence is the lack of comparisons with the SSRIs, which are usually recommended as first‐line treatments for acute depression. Studies with direct comparisons to SSRIs are needed to address this gap and may be supplemented by network meta‐analyses to define the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of depression. Plain language summary Vortioxetine for the treatment of depression in adults Why is this review important? Many people suffer from major depression. Major depression is a serious illness that can cause significant distress both to patients and their families. Major depression affects people's work and relationships, but can also affect people physically, for example by changing concentration or appetite. Available antidepressant medicines are not always effective in treating major depression and may also have unpleasant side effects. This review compares a new antidepressant, vortioxetine, to placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. sugar tablet) and other antidepressants. It is assumed that vortioxetine works differently from other available antidepressants and it is important to know if it is an effective treatment and a possible alternative for already available treatments. Who will be interested in this review? People affected by major depression and their families, general practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists, and pharmacists and other professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? Is vortioxetine more effective than placebo in treating individual with an episode of major depression?  Is vortioxetine more or less effective than other available antidepressant treatments?  Do more or fewer people stay in treatment when treated with vortioxetine compared to placebo or other antidepressants?  Do more or fewer people have side effects when treated with vortioxetine compared to other antidepressants? Which studies were included in the review? In May 2016, we searched electronic medical databases to find trials that compared vortioxetine to placebo or other antidepressants. We included only studies that used a randomised controlled design (where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and had adults (aged over 18 years) with a diagnosis of major depression. We included 15 trials, involving 7746 participants in the review. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, depending on the outcome (what symptom or effect was measured) and the comparison. Vortioxetine was more effective than placebo, but it was not more effective than other commonly used antidepressants. The studies found no difference in people stopping their treatment compared to placebo or other antidepressants. Vortioxetine was only compared to one type of medicine (called SNRIs) and not compared to the most frequently prescribed antidepressants. The outcomes varied markedly across studies. What should happen next? No firm conclusion on vortioxetine can be made. Vortioxetine was effective in treating acute major depression, but did not show a clear advantage in comparison with some treatments which are already available. Conclusions are also made difficult because comparisons to the most frequently prescribed antidepressants (called SSRIs) are lacking. Furthermore, it is unclear if vortioxetine has an advantage in specific side effects associated with commonly prescribed antidepressants, for example sexual problems. These questions should be addressed in future studies.

AB: Abstract - Background People with schizophrenia and severe mental illness may require considerable support from health care professionals, in most cases over a long period of time. Research on the effects of psychotherapy for schizophrenia has shown mixed results. Although pharmacological interventions remain the treatment of choice, the effects of treatments focusing on psychosocial factors affecting schizophrenia are important. Objectives To review the effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, or both, for people with schizophrenia or severe mental illness. Search methods For the updated review, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2008) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria We sought all randomised trials of individual psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis for people with schizophrenia or severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a fixed‐effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and weighted mean differences (WMD) using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We included four randomised trials (total 528 participants, 5 comparisons). All used a psychodynamic approach and reported limited data. For individual psychodynamic therapy versus medication alone we found significantly more participants in the therapy group were unable to be discharged (n=92, RR 8.35 CI 2.0 to 34.3, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6). We found no significant difference between groups in the number of participants who were re‐hospitalised (n=24, RR 0.63 CI 0.3 to 1.4) during long‐term analyses. At 12 months, fewer participants in the psychotherapy groups needed additional medications compared with those who did receive medication (n=74, RR 0.64 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 3 to 6), and also at three years follow up (n=87, RR 0.85 CI 0.8 to 1.0, NNT 7 CI 5 to 26). For individual psychodynamic therapy plus medication versus medication alone we found no significant difference in suicide (n=92, RR 0.16 CI 0.01 to 2.9) or suitability for discharge (n=92, RR 1.09 CI 0.2 to 7.4). Also, we found re‐hospitalisation rates in long‐term analyses were equivocal (n=24, RR 1.00 CI 0.4 to 2.6). For insight‐orientated psychodynamic psychotherapy versus reality adaptive psychotherapy we found no significant difference in re‐hospitalisation rates (n=164, RR 1.20 CI 0.9 to 1.6), but we found study attrition favoured the insight‐orientated psychodynamic psychotherapy group at 12 months (n=164, RR 0.46 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). For individual psychodynamic psychotherapy versus group psychotherapy we found no significant difference in global state 'not improved' (n=100, RR 1.27 CI 1.0 to 1.7). For individual psychodynamic therapy plus medication versus individual psychodynamic therapy we found rates of re‐hospitalisation during long‐term analyses were equivocal (n=24, RR 1.00 CI 0.4 to 2.6). There is no clear evidence of any positive effect of psychodynamic therapy and the possibility of adverse effects seems never to have been considered. We did not identify any trials using a psychoanalytic approach. Authors' conclusions Current data do not support the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy techniques for hospitalised people with schizophrenia. If psychoanalytic therapy is being used for people with schizophrenia there is an urgent need for trials. Plain language summary Individual psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis for schizophrenia and severe mental illness Psychodynamic treatment is an intervention that can be classed as one of the 'talking' therapies. The relationship between the person seeking therapy and the therapist form the main component of the therapy. Its use for people with schizophrenia as a sole treatment, without medication, has not been evaluated very well, apart from four studies in the early 1970s and 1980s. It is clear from the limited studies available that medication is an important part of any treatment for people with psychotic illnesses and should be used in conjunction with any talking treatments.

AB: Abstract - Background Major depressive disorder (MDD), or depression, is a syndrome characterised by a number of behavioural, cognitive and emotional features. It is most commonly associated with a sad or depressed mood, a reduced capacity to feel pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, loss of energy, altered sleep patterns, weight fluctuations, difficulty in concentrating and suicidal ideation. There is a need for more effective and better tolerated antidepressants to combat this condition. Agomelatine was recently added to the list of available antidepressant drugs; it is a novel antidepressant that works on melatonergic (MT 1  and MT 2 ), 5‐HT  2B  and 5‐HT 2C  receptors. Because the mechanism of action is claimed to be novel, it may provide a useful, alternative pharmacological strategy to existing antidepressant drugs. Objectives The objective of this review was 1) to determine the efficacy of agomelatine in alleviating acute symptoms of major depressive disorder in comparison with other antidepressants, 2) to review the acceptability of agomelatine in comparison with other antidepressant drugs, and, 3) to investigate the adverse effects of agomelatine, including the general prevalence of side effects in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Collaboration's Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 31 July 2013. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 onwards), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and PsycINFO (1967 onwards). We checked reference lists of relevant studies together with reviews and regulatory agency reports. No restrictions on date, language or publication status were applied to the search. Servier Laboratories (developers of agomelatine) and other experts in the field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating adult participants with major depression to agomelatine versus any other antidepressive agent. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and a double‐entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. Main results A total of 13 studies (4495 participants) were included in this review. Agomelatine was compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), namely paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and to the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), venlafaxine. Participants were followed up for six to 12 weeks. Agomelatine did not show any advantage or disadvantage over the other antidepressants for our primary outcome, response to treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08, P value 0.75 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16, P value 0.16 compared to venlafaxine). Also, agomelatine showed no advantage or disadvantage over other antidepressants for remission (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01, P value 0.07 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, P value 0.73 compared to venlafaxine). Overall, agomelatine appeared to be better tolerated than venlafaxine in terms of lower rates of drop outs (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67, P value 0.0005), and showed the same level of tolerability as SSRIs (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, P value 0.44). Agomelatine induced a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64, P value 0.007). With regard to the quality of the body of evidence, there was a moderate risk of bias for all outcomes, due to the number of included unpublished studies. There was some heterogeneity, particularly between published and unpublished studies. The included studies were conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, thus limiting the generalisability of the results to primary care settings. With regard to precision, the efficacy outcomes were precise, but the tolerability outcomes were mostly imprecise. Publication bias was variable and depended on the outcome of the trial. Our review included unpublished studies, and we think that this reduced the impact of publication bias. The overall methodological quality of the studies was not very good. Almost all of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures agomelatine (Servier), and some of these were unpublished. Attempts to contact the pharmaceutical company Servier for additional information on all unpublished studies were unsuccessful. Authors' conclusions Agomelatine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Agomelatine was better tolerated than paroxetine and venlafaxine in terms of overall side effects, and fewer participants treated with agomelatine dropped out of the trials due to side effects compared to sertraline and venlafaxine, but data were limited because the number of included studies was small. We found evidence that compared agomelatine with only a small number of other active antidepressive agents, and there were only a few trials for each comparison, which limits the generalisability of the results. Moreover, the overall methodological quality of the studies was low, and, therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the efficacy and tolerability of agomelatine. Plain language summary Agomelatine versus other antidepressant medication for depression Why is this review important? Major depression is a serious illness that can cause significant distress both to sufferers and their families. Major depression affects people's work, relationships and self‐esteem. It also affects people physically, changing their sleep patterns, concentration and appetite. The symptoms of major depression can lead people to feel hopeless and even suicidal. Antidepressant medications are an effective treatment option for major depression, but many have unpleasant side‐effects.  This review is important because it compares a new antidepressant, called agomelatine, with some other antidepressants used to treat major depression. Agomelatine works in a different way to existing antidepressants, it affects the hormone melatonin in the brain, and stimulates release of the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. Who may be interested in this review? People affected by major depression. General Practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists and pharmacists. Professionals working in adult mental health services. Families and friends of people who suffer from major depression. What questions does this review aim to answer? Does agomelatine work better than other antidepressant medications? Do patients tolerate agomelatine better than other antidepressants? How do the side‐effects of agomelatine compare with other antidepressants? Which studies were included in the review? In July 2013, we used electronic medical databases to find all published and unpublished medical trials that compared agomelatine with any other antidepressant. We also contacted Servier Laboratories (the developers of agomelatine) for additional information. To be included in the review, medical trials had to have a randomised design (i.e. be randomised controlled trials), and have adult participants (aged over 18) with a diagnosis of major depression. We identified 13 medical trials, involving a total of 4495 participants, that could be included in the review. The reviewers rated the overall quality of the trials as 'moderate'. Almost all of the trials included were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that developed agomelatine (Servier), which could introduce bias (research shows that funding strongly affects the outcomes of research studies). What does the evidence from the review tell us? The review included trials comparing agomelatine with a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and one antidepressant from the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor group, called venlafaxine. Participants in the studies were followed up for between six to 12 weeks. ‐ Agomelatine was no more or less effective in reducing symptoms of depression than any of the other antidepressants. ‐ Agomelatine was no more or less effective in preventing relapse of depression than any of the other antidepressants. ‐ Agomelatine was tolerated better than venlafaxine (fewer people discontinued treatment), but the same as the SSRIs. ‐ Agomelatine caused a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine. ‐ Agomelatine caused a lower rate of vomiting, nausea and sexual side‐effects than SSRIs. What should happen next? The reviewers conclude that agomelatine is not more effective than other antidepressants currently on the market. It did seem to be more tolerable to patients in terms of lower rates of some side‐effects, however, the quality of trials was low and there were only a few trials that compared agomelatine with each medication. No firm conclusion on agomelatine can be made because of problems with reporting of data in the trials included. The authors recommend that further trials of agomelatine versus placebo (dummy pill), particularly in primary care settings (where the majority of patient/practitioner contact take place, e.g. GP surgeries), should be carried out to improve the quality of evidence.

AB: Abstract - Background Paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone, is now available in an oral formulation for daily use; an intramuscular formulation for monthly administration is expected to follow shortly. Oral paliperidone is available commercially only in an extended release formulation that was used in all of the clinical trials we examined in this review. Objectives To compare effects of oral paliperidone with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2008) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to treat (NNT). We calculated Weighted Mean Differences (WMD) for continuous data. Main results Eight studies with 2567 participants compared paliperidone with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone (n=1926, 7 RCTs, RR 0.68 CI 0.61 to 0.75, NNT 7 CI 6 to 10) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone were significantly more likely to have an improvement in global state (n=1420, 4 RCTs, RR 0.69 CI 0.63 to 0.75, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6). People randomised to paliperidone were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n=1918, 7 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.34 to 0.66, NNT 17 CI 14 to 26) than those allocated to placebo. Paliperidone was associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia than placebo (n=1638, 5 RCTs, RR 1.88 CI 1.28 to 2.76, NNH 21 CI 11 to 90) and a consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) for both men (n=413, 4 RCTs, WMD 27.68 CI 23.66 to 31.69) and women (n=252, 4 RCTs, WMD 87.39 CI 74.27 to 100.51). People receiving paliperidone were more likely to experience extrapyramidal disorders (n=1680, 6 RCTs, RR 2.27 CI 1.31 to 3.95, NNH 28 CI 12 to 111) and weight gain (n=769, 4 RCTs, WMD 1.07 CI 0.65 to 1.49, I‐squared 78%) compared with those allocated to placebo. Three studies with 1692 participants compared paliperidone with 10 mg/day olanzapine. We found no differences between paliperidone and olanzapine for leaving in the short term (n=1332, 3 RCTs, RR 1.04 CI 0.89 to 1.21; ˜40% in both groups left by six weeks). Those receiving any dose of paliperidone were no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving olanzapine (n=1327, 3 RCTs, RR 1.07 CI 0.64 to 1.76). Data from all three studies found that paliperidone was associated with less weight change than olanzapine (n=660, 3 RCTs, WMD ‐0.88 CI ‐1.38 to ‐0.37). Results for various movement disorders all favoured olanzapine. One study lasting less than a week compared paliperidone with risperidone. When participants taking paliperidone were compared with participants taking 4 mg/day risperidone in this brief study, we found no significant difference in the recurrence of psychotic symptoms or in the incidence of adverse events. One study compared paliperidone, with a mean dose of 9.8 mg daily, versus quetiapine, with a mean dose of 599.1 mg daily, over six weeks. Patients receiving paliperidone were less likely to leave the study early (n=314, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.44 to 0.93, NNT 9 CI 6 to 43). No significant difference was observed in the recurrence of psychotic symptoms (n=317, 1 RCT, RR 0.65 CI 0.29 to 1.45, NNT 52 CI Not Significant). Participants receiving paliperidone were more likely to experience hypertonia (n=317, 1 RCT, RR 3.19 CI 1.31 to 7.77, NNH 13 CI 4 to 86) and tremor (n=317, 1 RCT, RR 2.60 CI 1.39 to 4.88, NNH 9 CI 4 to 34). There are no clear data regarding oral paliperidone relating to social functioning, services use, quality of life, patient satisfaction or cost. Authors' conclusions In short‐term studies, oral paliperidone is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its parent compound, risperidone, with movement disorders, weight gain and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When used at doses of 6 mg per day or higher, oral paliperidone appears comparable in efficacy to olanzapine 10 mg/day. A single study of six days duration found neither an advantage nor disadvantage of paliperidone compared to risperidone. When dosed flexibly with other psychotropics available, it appears to be comparable in efficacy to flexible doses of quetiapine with other psychotropics available. Plain language summary Oral paliperidone for schizophrenia Paliperidone, 9‐hydroxy‐risperidone, is an active metabolite of risperidone that is now commercially available in an oral formulation. We evaluated the efficacy, adverse effects, and safety of oral paliperidone in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. In short‐term studies, oral paliperidone is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone are similar to those of risperidone. No data comparing the efficacy of paliperidone to risperidone over a meaningful period of time was available for this review; in a six‐day trial comparing paliperidone to risperidone we identified no difference in recurrence of psychotic symptoms or adverse effects. The manufacturer is also developing an intramuscular long‐acting formulation, but it is not yet commercially available; its use in the treatment of schizophrenia will be considered in a separate review.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not reach a satisfactory clinical response with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians face the dilemma of increasing the antipsychotic dose in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. Objectives To examine the efficacy of increasing antipsychotic dose compared to keeping the same dose in the treatment of people with schizophrenia who have not responded (as defined in the individual studies) to an initial antipsychotic drug trial. We also examine the adverse effects associated with such a procedure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting useable data, comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose rather than maintaining the original dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data . We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results Ten relevant RCTs with 675 participants are included in this review. All trials were double blind except one single blind. All studies had a run‐in phase to confirm they did not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. The trials were published between 1980 and 2016. In most studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. In addition sample sizes were often small, limiting the overall quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the number of participants who showed clinically relevant response (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.40, 9 RCTs, N = 533,  low‐quality evidence ), or left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.07,  very low quality evidence ), or due to any reason (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90, 5 RCTs, N = 353,  low‐quality evidence ). Similarly, no clear difference was found in general mental state as measured by PANSS total score change (MD −1.44, 95% CI −6.85 to 3.97, 3 RCTs, N = 258,  very low quality evidence ). At least one adverse effect was equivocal between groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.50, 2 RCTs, N = 191,  very low quality evidence ). Data were not reported for time in hospital or quality‐of‐life outcomes. Finally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not show any effect on the primary outcome but these analyses were clearly underpowered. Authors' conclusions Current data do not show any clear differences between increasing or maintaining the antipsychotic dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Adverse effect reporting was limited and poor. There is an urgent need for further trials in order to determine the optional treatment strategy in such cases. Plain language summary Increasing versus maintaining the dose of antipsychotic medication for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to treatment Review question If a person with schizophrenia does not initially respond to an antipsychotic medication, is increasing the dose of this antipsychotic effective and safe? Background Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia do not respond fully (i.e. symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations still remain) with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians can consider increasing the antipsychotic dose beyond regular thresholds or switching to a different antipsychotic drug in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. The evidence surrounding the optimal treatment strategy is scarce. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia ran an electronic search of their specialised register up to 30 March 2017 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia who were not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment to receive either an increased antipsychotic dose or continue on the same dose. The search returned 1919 records, which were checked for eligibility by the review authors. Evidence found Ten trials met the review requirements and provided usable data. No clear difference between increasing the dose of the antipsychotic drug and continuing antipsychotic treatment at the same dose was shown for any efficacy (clinical response) or safety (incidence of adverse effects) outcomes. The evidence currently available is limited and of low or very low quality. In particular, very few studies reported adverse effects adequately. Conclusions The results of the present review show that there is no good‐quality evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that increasing the antipsychotic dose for patients not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment differs from continuing antipsychotic treatment at the same dose. No clear evidence regarding safety is available. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be made. Larger, well‐designed trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Current policy in the UK and elsewhere places emphasis on the provision of mental health services in the least restrictive setting, whilst also recognising that some children will require inpatient care. As a result, there are a range of mental health services to manage young people with serious mental health problems who are at risk of being admitted to an inpatient unit in community or outpatient settings. Objectives 1. To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and cost of mental health services that provide an alternative to inpatient care for children and young people.   2. To identify the range and prevalence of different models of service that seek to avoid inpatient care for children and young people. Search methods Our search included the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2006, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), EMBASE (1982 to 2006), the British Nursing Index (1994 to 2006), RCN database (1985 to 1996), CINAHL (1982 to 2006) and PsycInfo (1972 to 2007). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of mental health services providing specialist care, beyond the scope of generic outpatient provision, as an alternative to inpatient mental health care, for children or adolescents aged from five to 18 years who have a serious mental health condition requiring specialist services beyond the capacity of generic outpatient provision. The control group received mental health services in an inpatient or equivalent setting. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We grouped studies according to the intervention type but did not pool data because of differences in the interventions and measures of outcome. Where data were available we calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between groups at follow up. We also calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs for each outcome in terms of mean change from baseline to follow up using the follow‐up SDs. We calculated SMDs (taking into account the direction of change and the scoring of each instrument) so that negative SMDs indicate results that favour treatment and positive SMDs favour the control group. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials (recruiting a total of 799 participants) evaluating four distinct models of care: multi‐systemic therapy (MST) at home, specialist outpatient service, intensive home treatment and intensive home‐based crisis intervention ('Homebuilders' model for crisis intervention). Young people receiving home‐based MST experienced some improved functioning in terms of externalising symptoms and they spent fewer days out of school and out‐of‐home placement. At short term follow up the control group had a greater improvement in terms of adaptability and cohesion; this was not sustained at four months follow up. There were small, significant patient improvements reported in both groups in the trial evaluating the intensive home‐based crisis intervention using the 'Homebuilders' model. No differences at follow up were reported in the two trials evaluating intensive home treatment, or in the trials evaluating specialist outpatient services. Authors' conclusions The quality of the evidence base currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. If randomised controlled trials are not feasible then consideration should be given to alternative study designs, such as prospective systems of audit conducted across several centres, as this has the potential to improve the current level of evidence. These studies should include baseline measurement at admission along with demographic data, and outcomes measured using a few standardised robust instruments. Plain language summary Health care services instead of admission to hospital for young people or children with mental health problems Many countries place emphasis on providing mental health services in the least restrictive setting, recognizing that some children will need to be admitted to hospital.  As a result there are a range of mental health services to manage young people with serious mental health problems in community or outpatient settings who are at risk of being admitted to hospital. This review found seven studies which evaluated whether these other services helped children and young people with mental health problems.  This review did not find any studies about intensive day treatment (where children attend treatment programmes during the day for a short period of time), intensive case management (health care professionals coordinate services and support for the children), therapeutic foster care (children live with specially trained foster parents) or residential care with inpatient care (children live in a residence, but not a hospital, which provides mental health care services). The studies evaluated four different types of services.  In  Multisystemic therapy (MST) at home , therapists provide therapy to the child and the family together in their home.  Some behaviours in the children, improved with MST.  They also spent fewer days out of school and in hospital.  Intensive home treatment  provides children with therapy in their home to solve problems with the way they interact with other people in the home and to improve their psychological symptoms.  Children who received this type of service did not improve any more than children who did not.   Intensive home based crisis intervention  (Homebuilders model for crisis intervention), focuses on the child and family to learn skills in relationship building, reframing problems, anger management, communication, and cognitive behavioural therapy.  Children with this service had small improvements.  Specialist outpatient services  are provided by a range of health care professionals in clinics.  Children who received this service did not improve any more than children who did not. The quality of some of the studies was not high and most did not have enough people to evaluate the true effect of the services.  The evidence we now have provides very little guidance for the development of these types of services.

AB: Abstract - Background Depressive disorders often begin during childhood or adolescence. There is a growing body of evidence supporting effective treatments during the acute phase of a depressive disorder. However, little is known about treatments for preventing relapse or recurrence of depression once an individual has achieved remission or recovery from their symptoms. Objectives To determine the efficacy of early interventions, including psychological and pharmacological interventions, to prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 1 June 2011). The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from  The Cochrane Library  (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition we handsearched the references of all included studies and review articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials using a psychological or pharmacological intervention, with the aim of preventing relapse or recurrence from an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymic disorder (DD) in children and adolescents were included. Participants were required to have been diagnosed with MDD or DD according to DSM or ICD criteria, using a standardised and validated assessment tool. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all trials for inclusion in the review, extracted trial and outcome data, and assessed trial quality. Results for dichotomous outcomes are expressed as odds ratio and continuous measures as mean difference or standardised mean difference. We combined results using random‐effects meta‐analyses, with 95% confidence intervals. We contacted lead authors of included trials and requested additional data where possible. Main results Nine trials with 882 participants were included in the review. In five trials the outcome assessors were blind to the participants' intervention condition and in the remainder of trials it was unclear. In the majority of trials, participants were either not blind to their intervention condition, or it was unclear whether they were or not. Allocation concealment was also unclear in the majority of trials. Although all trials treated participants in an outpatient setting, the designs implemented in trials was diverse, which limits the generalisability of the results. Three trials indicated participants treated with antidepressant medication had lower relapse‐recurrence rates (40.9%) compared to those treated with placebo (66.6%) during a relapse prevention phase (odds ratio (OR) 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.64, P = 0.02). One trial that compared a combination of psychological therapy and medication to medication alone favoured a combination approach over medication alone, however this result did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.15). The majority of trials that involved antidepressant medication reported adverse events including suicide‐related behaviours. However, there were not enough data to show which treatment approach results in the most favourable adverse event profile. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is little evidence to conclude which type of treatment approach is most effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of depressive episodes in children and adolescents. Limited trials found that antidepressant medication reduces the chance of relapse‐recurrence in the future, however, there is considerable diversity in the design of trials, making it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Some of the research involving psychological therapies is encouraging, however at present more trials with larger sample sizes need to be conducted in order to explore this treatment approach further. Plain language summary Treatments for preventing the recurrence of depression in children and adolescents Many children and adolescents diagnosed with a depressive disorder will experience a relapse or recurrence of their symptoms. Little is known about what treatment approach works best to prevent this from occurring, once a child or adolescent has initially remitted or recovered from a depressive episode. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of early interventions, including psychological, social and pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.The review included nine studies that assessed the efficacy of antidepressant medication and psychological therapies in reducing the risk of a future depressive episode in children and adolescents. Trials varied in their quality and methodological design, limiting conclusions that could be drawn from the result. Overall, the review found that antidepressant medication reduces the chance that children and adolescents will experience another episode of depression, compared with a pill placebo. Psychological therapies also look promising as a treatment to prevent future depressive episodes, however given the aforementioned issues concerning trial quality and design, along with the small number of trials included in the review, it is unclear how effective these therapies are at present.

AB: Abstract - Background Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Newer generation antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often used, however evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Objectives To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Search methods For this update of the review, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 ‐), MEDLINE (1950 ‐) and PsycINFO (1967 ‐). We searched clinical trial registries and pharmaceutical company websites. We checked reference lists of included trials and other reviews, and sent letters to key researchers and the pharmaceutical companies of included trials from January to August 2011. Selection criteria Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over trials and cluster trials comparing a newer generation antidepressant with a placebo in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old and diagnosed with a depressive disorder were eligible for inclusion. In this update, we amended the selection criteria to include newer generation antidepressants rather than SSRIs only. Data collection and analysis Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a random‐effects meta‐analysis. We used risk ratio (RR) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) to summarise continuous measures. Main results Nineteen trials of a range of newer antidepressants compared with placebo, containing 3335 participants, were included. The trials excluded young people at high risk of suicide and many co‐morbid conditions and the participants are likely to be less unwell than those seen in clinical practice. We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high drop out rates and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials. Overall, there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores and higher rates of response/remission than those on placebo. However, the size of these effects was small with a reduction in depression symptoms of 3.51 on a scale from 17 to 113 (14 trials; N = 2490; MD ‐3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.55 to ‐2.47). Remission rates increased from 380 per 1000 to 448 per 1000 for those treated with an antidepressant. There was evidence of an increased risk (58%) of suicide‐related outcome for those on antidepressants compared with a placebo (17 trials; N = 3229; RR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.45). This equates to an increased risk in a group with a median baseline risk from 25 in 1000 to 40 in 1000. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that the magnitude of intervention effects (compared with placebo) were modified by individual drug class. Authors' conclusions Caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. Further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. However, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. Clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide‐related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications. Plain language summary Newer antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents Depression is common in young people and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, such as poor academic functioning, difficulties in peer and family relationships, increases in substance use, and both attempted and completed suicide. This review contained 19 trials (with a total of 3353 participants) testing the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants (these are antidepressants developed and used since tricyclic antidepressants were developed). These include the well‐known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have an impact primarily on the brain chemical called serotonin, as well as several other newer classes of antidepressants now being used, which aim to target noradrenaline and dopamine as well as serotonin and include selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs)) for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Based on 14 of the trials (2490 participants in total), there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores than those on placebo, however, the size of this difference was small. Based on 17 trials (3229 participants in total), there was evidence of an increased risk (64%) of suicide‐related outcomes for those on antidepressants compared with those given placebo. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that one particular type of newer generation antidepressant had a larger effect than the others when compared to placebo. It is unclear how meaningful the results regarding the effectiveness of these medications are in terms of a young person's day‐to‐day functioning. Children and adolescents with other conditions (such as anxiety, substance use disorder or a conduct disorder) as well as depression, and those at risk of suicide, were often excluded from trials. However, these young people are more representative of the population who present to clinical services, therefore it is not possible to predict how they would respond to antidepressants. There was often insufficient information to judge the quality of the trials accurately. With these limitations, it is difficult to answer questions about the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for treating depression in children and adolescents. Clinicians need to provide accurate information to children and adolescents, and their families, about the uncertainties regarding the benefits and risks of newer generation antidepressant medication as a treatment option for depression. If a decision to use medication is agreed then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations and, if used, the risk of suicide should be assessed and monitored particularly closely.

AB: Abstract - Background Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents and, if left untreated, are likely to recur in adulthood. Depression is highly debilitating, affecting psychosocial, family and academic functioning. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, for the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents. We have examined clinical outcomes including remission, clinician and self reported depression measures, and suicide‐related outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 11 June 2014. The register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Selection criteria RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they compared i) any psychological therapy with any antidepressant medication, or ii) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a psychological therapy alone, or an antidepressant medication alone, or iii) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a placebo or ' treatment as usual', or (iv) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a psychological therapy or antidepressant medication plus a placebo. We included studies if they involved participants aged between 6 and 18 years, diagnosed by a clinician as having Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies. We applied a random‐effects meta‐analysis, using the odds ratio (OR) to describe dichotomous outcomes, mean difference (MD) to describe continuous outcomes when the same measures were used, and standard mean difference (SMD) when outcomes were measured on different scales. Main results We included eleven studies, involving 1307 participants in this review. We also identified one ongoing study, and two additional ongoing studies that may be eligible for inclusion. Studies recruited participants with different severities of disorder and with a variety of comorbid disorders, including anxiety and substance use disorder, therefore limiting the comparability of the results. Regarding the risk of bias in studies, just under half the studies had adequate allocation concealment (there was insufficient information to determine allocation concealment in the remainder), outcome assessors were blind to the participants' intervention in six studies, and in general, studies reported on incomplete data analysis methods, mainly using intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses. For the majority of outcomes there were no statistically significant differences between the interventions compared. There was limited evidence (based on two studies involving 220 participants) that antidepressant medication was more effective than psychotherapy on measures of clinician defined remission immediately post‐intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.98), with 67.8% of participants in the medication group and 53.7% in the psychotherapy group rated as being in remission. There was limited evidence (based on three studies involving 378 participants) that combination therapy was more effective than antidepressant medication alone in achieving higher remission from a depressive episode immediately post‐intervention (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.47), with 65.9% of participants treated with combination therapy and 57.8% of participants treated with medication, rated as being in remission. There was no evidence to suggest that combination therapy was more effective than psychological therapy alone, based on clinician rated remission immediately post‐intervention (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.68). Suicide‐related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in various ways across studies and could not be combined in meta‐analyses. However, some trials measured suicidal ideation using standardised assessment tools suitable for meta‐analysis. In one study involving 188 participants, rates of suicidal ideation were significantly higher in the antidepressant medication group (18.6%) compared with the psychological therapy group (5.4%) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.72) and this effect appeared to remain at six to nine months (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98), with 13.6% of participants in the medication group and 3.9% of participants in the psychological therapy group reporting suicidal ideation. It was unclear what the effect of combination therapy was compared with either antidepressant medication alone or psychological therapy alone on rates of suicidal ideation. The impact of any of the assigned treatment packages on drop out was also mostly unclear across the various comparisons in the review. Limited data and conflicting results based on other outcome measures make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of any specific intervention based on these outcomes. Authors' conclusions There is very limited evidence upon which to base conclusions about the relative effectiveness of psychological interventions, antidepressant medication and a combination of these interventions. On the basis of the available evidence, the effectiveness of these interventions for treating depressive disorders in children and adolescents cannot be established. Further appropriately powered RCTs are required. Plain language summary Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, with suggested overall prevalence rates for adolescents (13 to 18 years) being 5.7% and for children (under 13 years) 2.8%. Common symptoms of depression in children and adolescents include low mood, a loss of interest in once enjoyed activities, difficulties with concentration and motivation, changes in appetite and sleep, irritability, physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach aches and in some cases thoughts of suicide. If left untreated, depressive disorders in the younger years are likely to continue into adulthood, and can be increasingly difficult to treat as time goes on. Both psychological therapies and antidepressant medication can be used to treat depression in children and adolescents. Psychological therapies, sometimes called 'talking therapies', involve working with a qualified therapist to treat the depression. Psychological therapies in common use are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychodynamic therapy. There are many different types of antidepressant medication, all of which have been developed specifically to work on chemicals in the brain that are believed to be linked to depression. Research has been undertaken on psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, to asses the effects of these interventions on depression in children and adolescents. In order to asses whether either intervention or a combination of both is most effective, we included studies that compared: (1) any psychological therapy with any antidepressant medication; (2) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with either psychotherapy alone or antidepressant medication alone; (3) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with a placebo or ' treatment as usual'; (4) any combination of these therapies (a psychological therapy plus antidepressant medication) with either therapy plus a placebo. We included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1307 participants in this review. These trials made a variety of different comparisons and only a small number of trials contributed information about each of the comparisons made in the review. Although most analyses included more than one trial, the results of these trials sometimes differed considerably or were even contradictory. In terms of adverse effects of treatment, in one trial, rates of suicidal thoughts were higher in those taking antidepressant medication, compared with those delivered psychological therapy. Overall, it was not possible to draw robust conclusions from the meta‐analyses, nor to establish which intervention strategy was most effective. In summary, on the basis of the available evidence, we do not know whether psychological therapy, antidepressant medication or a combination of the two is most effective to treat depressive disorders in children and adolescents.

AB: Abstract - Background Clozapine is an efficacious treatment for treatment‐resistant schizophrenia; however its use can be limited by side effect intolerability. Sinus tachycardia is a common adverse event associated with clozapine treatment. Various pharmacological treatments are used to control heart rate increase due to clozapine use and can include a decreased rate of clozapine titration, a switch to a different antipsychotic, or treatment with negative chronotropic drugs. Objectives To assess the clinical effects and efficacy of pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia. To systematically review the adverse events associated with pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia. Search methods On 23 March 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions, at any dose and by any route of administration, for clozapine‐induced tachycardia. Data collection and analysis We independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre‐specified inclusion criteria. Main results The electronic searches located three references. However, we did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions With no studies meeting the inclusion criteria, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. There are currently insufficient data to confidently inform clinical practice. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether specific interventions, such as beta‐blockers, are less effective or more effective than standard courses of alternative treatments for tachycardia. This lack of evidence for the treatment of clozapine‐induced tachycardia has implications for research and practice. Well‐planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated. One trial is currently underway. Current practice outside of well‐designed randomised trials should be clearly justified. Plain language summary Pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Clozapine is the only treatment proven to be effective for those people who do not respond to other antipsychotic medications. A fast pulse rate (tachycardia) is one of the more common side effects associated with clozapine use. It is reported to occur in 25 out of every 100 people treated with clozapine. The occurrence of a fast pulse rate may lead to palpitations in the person treated with clozapine, which can be unpleasant and worrying. A fast pulse rate by itself is not necessarily dangerous to the person and can be treated. There are medications available to treat a fast pulse rate and slow it down to a normal rate. Examples of such medications include beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers. However, a fast pulse rate can lead to clozapine being stopped by doctors. This review is about ways to reduce this problem, to find out if any treatment for a fast heart rate with clozapine use is better than another. This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at treating a fast heart rate associated with clozapine treatment. Unfortunately, we found no studies that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on the treatment is much needed. Finding answers to this question will aid people treated with clozapine, and their doctors, in ensuring that a fast heart rate with clozapine can be treated and that clozapine can be safely continued.

AB: Abstract - Background Psychotic disorders can lead some people to become agitated. Characterised by restlessness, excitability and irritability, this can result in verbal and physically aggressive behaviour ‐ and both can be prolonged. Aggression within the psychiatric setting imposes a significant challenge to clinicians and risk to service users; it is a frequent cause for admission to inpatient facilities. If people continue to be aggressive it can lengthen hospitalisation. Haloperidol is used to treat people with long‐term aggression. Objectives To examine whether haloperidol alone, administered orally, intramuscularly or intravenously, is an effective treatment for long‐term/persistent aggression in psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2011 and April 2015). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or double blind trials (implying randomisation) with useable data comparing haloperidol with another drug or placebo for people with psychosis and long‐term/persistent aggression. Data collection and analysis One review author (AK) extracted data. For dichotomous data, one review author (AK) calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed‐effect model. One review author (AK) assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We have no good‐quality evidence of the absolute effectiveness of haloperidol for people with long‐term aggression. One study randomising 110 chronically aggressive people to three different antipsychotic drugs met the inclusion criteria. When haloperidol was compared with olanzapine or clozapine, skewed data (n=83) at high risk of bias suggested some advantage in terms of scale scores of unclear clinical meaning for olanzapine/clozapine for 'total aggression'. Data were available for only one other outcome, leaving the study early. When compared with other antipsychotic drugs, people allocated to haloperidol were no more likely to leave the study (1 RCT, n=110, RR 1.37, CI 0.84 to 2.24,  low‐quality evidence ). Although there were some data for the outcomes listed above, there were no data on most of the binary outcomes and none on service outcomes (use of hospital/police), satisfaction with treatment, acceptance of treatment, quality of life or economics. Authors' conclusions Only one study could be included and most data were heavily skewed, almost impossible to interpret and of low quality.  There were also some limitations in the study design with unclear description of allocation concealment and high risk of bias for selective reporting, so no firm conclusions can be made. This review shows how trials in this group of people are possible ‐ albeit difficult. Further relevant trials are needed to evaluate use of haloperidol in treatment of long‐term/persistent aggression in people living with psychosis. Plain language summary Haloperidol for long‐term aggression in psychosis Background People experiencing distressing delusions and hallucinations can often become agitated and aggressive. The antipsychotic drug haloperidol is widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis‐induced agitation despite the possibility it can cause a number of serious side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, restlessness and muscle spasms. Study characteristics The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group ran an electronic search for clinical trials involving the use of haloperidol for psychosis‐induced aggression in July 2011 and April 2015. We found one study with 110 participants, diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants had been physically aggressive during recent hospitalisation and involved in at least one other aggressive event. The study randomised participants to receive either haloperidol, clozapine or olanzapine. Key results Most data presented were impossible to use and it is unclear if haloperidol is effective for reducing aggression or improving mental state for people who are aggressive due to psychosis. There were no data regarding side effects. The number of people leaving the study early from each treatment group was similar. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence available is low, only one study with a high risk of selective reporting of results provided data. No firm conclusions can be made until further good‐quality data are available.

AB: Abstract - Background Evidence from some, but not all non‐randomised studies suggest the possibility that cognitive training may influence cognitive functioning in older people. Due to the differences among cognitive training interventions reported in the literature, giving a general overview of the current literature remains difficult. Objectives To systematically review the literature and summarize the effect of cognitive training interventions on various domains of cognitive function (ie memory, executive function, attention and speed) in healthy older people and in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods The CDCIG Specialized Register was searched on 30 September 2007 for all years up to December 2005.  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched separately on 30 September 2007 to find trials with healthy people. These results were supplemented by searches from January 1970 to September 2007 in PsychInfo/Psyndex, ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed. Selection criteria RCTs of interventions evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive training for healthy older people and people with mild cognitive impairment from 1970 to 2007 that met inclusion criteria were selected. Data collection and analysis Authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Meta‐analysis was performed when appropriate. Main results Only data on memory training could be pooled for analysis. Within this domain, training interventions were grouped according to several outcome variables. Results showed that for  healthy older adults , immediate and delayed verbal recall improved significantly through training compared to a no‐treatment control condition. We did not find any specific memory training effects though as the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in the active control condition. For  individuals with mild cognitive impairment , our analyses demonstrate the same pattern. Thus, there is currently little evidence on the effectiveness and specificity of memory interventions for healthy older adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Authors' conclusions There is evidence that cognitive interventions do lead to performance gains but none of the effects observed could be attributable specifically to cognitive training, as the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in active control conditions. This does not mean that longer, more intense or different interventions might not be effective, but that those which have been reported thus far have only limited effect. We therefore suggest more standardized study protocols in order to maximize comparability of studies and to maximize the possibility of data pooling ‐ also in other cognitive domains than memory. Plain language summary Effects of memory training in healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive impairment There is an increasing interest in information on the effectiveness of cognitive training interventions to improve memory in normal and mildly cognitively impaired older adults (60 years and older). We analyzed all cognitive interventions between 1970 and 2007 to determine their effectiveness. The results suggest that cognitive interventions do lead to performance improvements and that the size of the effects differs for different kinds of memory skills in healthy older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment. In particular, immediate and delayed verbal recall improved significantly through training compared to a no‐treatment control condition but the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in the active control conditions.

AB: Abstract - Background The sustained interest in electronic assistive technology in dementia care has been fuelled by the urgent need to develop useful approaches to help support people with dementia at home. Also the low costs and wide availability of electronic devices make it more feasible to use electronic devices for the benefit of disabled persons. Information Communication Technology (ICT) devices designed to support people with dementia are usually referred to as Assistive Technology (AT) or Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT). By using AT in this review we refer to electronic assistive devices. A range of AT devices has been developed to support people with dementia and their carers to manage their daily activities and to enhance safety, for example electronic pill boxes, picture phones, or mobile tracking devices. Many are commercially available. However, the usefulness and user‐friendliness of these devices are often poorly evaluated. Although reviews of (electronic) memory aids do exist, a systematic review of studies focusing on the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia is lacking. Such a review would guide people with dementia and their informal and professional carers in selecting appropriate AT devices. Objectives Primary objective To assess the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia in terms of daily performance of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), level of dependency, and admission to long‐term care. Secondary objective To assess the impact of AT on: users (autonomy, usefulness and user‐friendliness, adoption of AT); cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms; need for informal and formal care; perceived quality of life; informal carer burden, self‐esteem and feelings of competence; formal carer work satisfaction, workload and feelings of competence; and adverse events. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), on 10 November 2016. ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists of the CDCIG and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and cognitive enhancement in healthy people. We also searched the following list of databases, adapting the search strategy as necessary: Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, up to May 2016; The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies; DBLP Computer Science Bibliography; HCI Bibliography: Human‐Computer Interaction Resources; and AgeInfo, all to June 2016; PiCarta; Inspec; Springer Link Lecture Notes; Social Care Online; and IEEE Computer Society Digital Library, all to October 2016; J‐STAGE: Japan Science and Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic; and Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (NCSTRL), both to November 2016; Computing Research Repository (CoRR) up to December 2016; and OT seeker; and ADEAR, both to February 2017. In addition, we searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE for grey literature. Selection criteria We intended to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clustered randomised trials with blinded assessment of outcomes that evaluated an electronic assistive device used with the single aim of supporting memory function in people diagnosed with dementia. The control interventions could either be 'care (or treatment) as usual' or non‐technological psychosocial interventions (including interventions that use non‐electronic assistive devices) also specifically aimed at supporting memory. Outcome measures included activities of daily living, level of dependency, clinical and care‐related outcomes (for example admission to long‐term care), perceived quality of life and well‐being, and adverse events resulting from the use of AT; as well as the effects of AT on carers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts identified by the search. Main results We identified no studies which met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the current lack of high‐quality evidence to determine whether AT is effective in supporting people with dementia to manage their memory problems. Plain language summary Assistive technology for memory support in dementia Review question We wanted to find out from a review of the evidence whether Assistive Technology can help people with dementia overcome some of the effects of their memory problems. Background Dementia causes memory problems that make it increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities, for example cooking, remembering appointments, taking medication. The memory problems experienced can have a large negative impact on people with dementia, and may cause confusion, anxiety, embarrassment, or depression. This decreasing ability to carry out daily activities can cause stress to family carers who worry about the person’s safety and well‐being. A range of electronic devices — most commonly referred to as Assistive Technology (AT – used throughout this review), and sometimes as Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT) — have been developed to support people with dementia. The devices can be divided into four categories offering support with general and personal information (e.g. digital social charts); practical support with problems caused by the symptoms of dementia, especially memory loss (e.g. electronic pill dispenser boxes, electronic diaries); support with social contact and company (e.g. picture phones, interactive ‘pet’ robots); and support with perceived risks to health and safety (e.g. tracking devices, fall sensors). In this review, we concentrated on devices intended to help people manage their memory problems. We wanted to find our whether AT is effective at helping people who have memory problems due to dementia carry out their daily activities, and whether it makes them less dependent on others, improves their quality of life or has an effect on admission to institutional care. We also wanted to find out if it has any impact on family and paid carers. Study characteristics We searched systematically for all research studies that had evaluated AT by allocating people with dementia at random to an AT device or to 'usual care' or a non‐technological solution to support memory and then comparing outcomes. Our search included all the evidence available up to 10 November 2016. Key results We found no studies that met our criteria. Quality of the evidence The review identified a lot of literature on the development of AT, including reports of researchers working with people with dementia and their carers to determine the type and design of AT which might be useful. There was also a lot of guidance written for health professionals and potential users of AT. We found some small studies that had tested the effectiveness of selected AT devices, but the methods used were not of a high enough quality to meet the review criteria. Therefore we cannot be sure at the moment whether or not AT can really help people with dementia manage their memory problems. We believe more research should be done in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Agitated or violent behaviour constitutes 10% of all emergency psychiatric treatment. Some guidelines do not recommend the use of chlorpromazine for rapid tranquillisation but it is still often used for this purpose. Objectives To examine the effects of oral or intramuscular chlorpromazine for psychosis induced agitation or aggression. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (up to July 2009) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria Randomised control trials or double blind trials (implying randomisation) comparing chlorpromazine with another drug or placebo for people who are thought to be acutely aggressive or agitated due to psychotic illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed‐effects model. Main results One study (total n=30) met the inclusion criteria. When compared with haloperidol ( Man 1973 ) (1 RCT, n=30) people allocated chlorpromazine were no more likely to have one additional injection than those allocated haloperidol (RR 3.00 CI 0.13 to 68.26). This remained true for 2‐4 injections (RR 0.90 CI 0.52 to 1.55) and for 5 or more injections (RR 0.75 CI 0.20 to 2.79). Two people allocated chlorpromazine had sudden, serious hypotension while no one allocated haloperidol had such an effect (RR 5.00 CI 0.26 to 96.13). No extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. One person allocated chlorpromazine developed status epilepticus (RR 3.00 CI 0.13 to 68.26). Authors' conclusions Overall the quality of evidence is limited, poor and dated. Where drugs that have been better evaluated are available, it may be best to avoid use of chlorpromazine. Where chlorpromazine is used for acute aggression or where choices are limited, relevant trials are possible and urgently needed. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine for treating aggression or agitation due to psychosis Chlorpromazine was the first medicine specifically developed to treat psychoses as it helps people to feel less anxious, tense or angry. This review systematically examines the evidence to see how effective chlorpromazine is at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis. From the evidence available, we are unable to draw any firm conclusion about using this medicine for this purpose. We found that chlorpromazine was just as effective at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis as similar medicines, but that it may be associated with more side effects than other medicines. Further research is needed to clarify whether chlorpromazine is effective at reducing psychosis induced aggression or agitation. Such research would be best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials.

AB: Abstract - Background Psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with chronic illness aim to improve parenting behavior and mental health, child functioning (behavior/disability, mental health, and medical symptoms), and family functioning. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review (2012) which was first updated in 2015. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and trials registries for studies published up to July 2018. Selection criteria Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. In this update we included studies with more than 20 participants per arm. In this update, we included interventions that combined psychological and pharmacological treatments. We included comparison groups that received either non‐psychological treatment (e.g. psychoeducation), treatment as usual (e.g. standard medical care without added psychological therapy), or wait‐list. Data collection and analysis We extracted study characteristics and outcomes post‐treatment and at first available follow‐up. Primary outcomes were parenting behavior and parent mental health. Secondary outcomes were child behavior/disability, child mental health, child medical symptoms, and family functioning. We pooled data using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and a random‐effects model, and evaluated outcomes by medical condition and by therapy type. We assessed risk of bias per Cochrane guidance and quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results We added 21 new studies. We removed 23 studies from the previous update that no longer met our inclusion criteria. There are now 44 RCTs, including 4697 participants post‐treatment. Studies included children with asthma (4), cancer (7), chronic pain (13), diabetes (15), inflammatory bowel disease (2), skin diseases (1), and traumatic brain injury (3). Therapy types included cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT; 21), family therapy (4), motivational interviewing (3), multisystemic therapy (4), and problem‐solving therapy (PST; 12). We rated risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, except selective reporting bias, which we rated high for 19 studies due to incomplete outcome reporting. Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. We downgraded evidence due to high heterogeneity, imprecision, and publication bias. Evaluation of parent outcomes by medical condition Psychological therapies may improve parenting behavior (e.g. maladaptive or solicitous behaviors; lower scores are better) in children with cancer post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.43 to −0.13; participants = 664; studies = 3; SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.05; participants = 625; studies = 3; I 2  = 0%, respectively, low‐quality evidence), chronic pain post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.29, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.10; participants = 755; studies = 6; SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.20; participants = 678; studies = 5, respectively, moderate‐quality evidence), diabetes post‐treatment (SMD −1.39, 95% CI −2.41 to −0.38; participants = 338; studies = 5, very low‐quality evidence), and traumatic brain injury post‐treatment (SMD −0.74, 95% CI −1.25 to −0.22; participants = 254; studies = 3, very low‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment. Psychological therapies may improve parent mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, lower scores are better) in children with cancer post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.08; participants = 836, studies = 6, high‐quality evidence; SMD −0.23, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.08; participants = 667; studies = 4, moderate‐quality evidence, respectively), and chronic pain post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.06; participants = 490; studies = 3; SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.02; participants = 482; studies = 3, respectively, low‐quality evidence). Parent mental health did not improve in studies of children with diabetes post‐treatment (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.90 to 0.42; participants = 211; studies = 3, very low‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses, data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment on parent mental health. Evaluation of parent outcomes by psychological therapy type CBT may improve parenting behavior post‐treatment (SMD −0.45, 95% CI −0.68 to −0.21; participants = 1040; studies = 9, low‐quality evidence), and follow‐up (SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.11; participants = 743; studies = 6, moderate‐quality evidence). We did not find evidence for a beneficial effect for CBT on parent mental health at post‐treatment or follow‐up (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.03; participants = 811; studies = 8; SMD −0.07, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.20; participants = 592; studies = 5; respectively, very low‐quality evidence). PST may improve parenting behavior post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.39, 95% CI −0.64 to −0.13; participants = 947; studies = 7, low‐quality evidence; SMD −0.54, 95% CI −0.94 to −0.14; participants = 852; studies = 6, very low‐quality evidence, respectively), and parent mental health post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.45 to −0.15; participants = 891; studies = 6; SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.07; participants = 800; studies = 5, respectively, moderate‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses, data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment on parent outcomes. Adverse events We could not evaluate treatment safety because most studies (32) did not report on whether adverse events occurred during the study period. In six studies, the authors reported that no adverse events occurred. The remaining six studies reported adverse events and none were attributed to psychological therapy. We rated the quality of evidence for adverse events as moderate. Authors' conclusions Psychological therapy may improve parenting behavior among parents of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, and traumatic brain injury. We also found beneficial effects of psychological therapy may also improve parent mental health among parents of children with cancer and chronic pain. CBT and PST may improve parenting behavior. PST may also improve parent mental health. However, the quality of evidence is generally low and there are insufficient data to evaluate most outcomes. Our findings could change as new studies are conducted. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with a longstanding or life‐threatening physical illness Bottom line We found that psychological therapies may improve parenting behavior for parents of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes or traumatic brain injury, and may improve mental health of parents of children with cancer or chronic pain. Cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) and problem‐solving therapy (PST) are promising types of therapy. We were not able to answer questions about whether psychological therapies are helpful for parents of children with other medical conditions, or whether other types of therapy are helpful, because there were not enough data. Our findings may have been impacted by differences in measures used across studies. New studies may change the results of this review, and so our findings should be interpreted cautiously. Background We have updated our previously published review of psychological therapies for parents of children with a longstanding or life‐threatening physical illness to include studies published through July 2018. Parenting a child with a longstanding illness is challenging. Parents may have difficulty balancing caring for their child with other demands and can experience increased stress, sadness, or family conflict. Their children may have emotional or behavioral concerns. Parents can influence their child's adaptation to living with their medical condition. Psychological therapies for parents provide training in skills to modify emotions or behaviors that aim to improve parent, child, and family well‐being. We wanted to understand whether psychological therapies are helpful for parents of children and adolescents (up to age 19) with longstanding illness. We included studies of interventions that were predominantly psychological and delivered to parents compared with non‐psychological treatment, treatment as usual, or wait‐list. Outcomes were parenting behavior (e.g. protective behaviors), parent mental health, child behavior/disability, child mental health, child medical symptoms, family functioning, and side effects. Key results We added 21 new studies in this update and we removed 23 studies that no longer met our inclusion criteria, resulting in 44 randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trials, where participants are assigned randomly to either one treatment or a different treatment or no treatment, provide the most reliable evidence) with a total of 4697 participants (average child age = 11 years). The length of the studies ranged from one day to 24 months. Studies included children with asthma (4), cancer (7), chronic pain (recurrent or persistent pain for more than three months, including two studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease (15)), diabetes (15), skin diseases (1), and traumatic brain injury (3); one study included children with eczema and children with asthma. Therapy types included CBT (21), family therapy (4), motivational interviewing (3), multisystemic therapy (4), and PST (12). Funding sources included federal and local governments, hospitals, universities, and foundations. We found that parenting behavior improved in studies of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, and traumatic brain injury immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term for parents of children with cancer and chronic pain. Parent mental health improved in studies of children with cancer and chronic pain immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term. Parent mental health did not improve in studies of children with diabetes. We found that CBT and PST improved parenting behavior immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term. PST also improved parent mental health immediately after treatment and long‐term, but CBT did not. We could not evaluate whether the other types of psychological therapy were beneficial for parents due to insufficient data. We found that these treatment effects were generally small. We found that most studies (32 studies) did not report on whether side effects occurred. In the few studies that did, none of the participants experienced side effects from psychological therapy. Quality of evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. There were not enough data to answer some parts of our review questions. There was sufficient evidence (low to moderate quality) to reach some conclusions about the effects of psychological therapy for parents of children with cancer and chronic pain and the effects of CBT and PST.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010033.pub2
AB: Abstract - Background Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of communicating hydrocephalus also known as non‐obstructive hydrocephalus. This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim‐Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts. To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting. Search methods We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim‐Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data. Main results Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non‐programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results. Authors' conclusions The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non‐programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence. There is a need for more robust research on this topic to be able to determine the effectiveness of ETV in patients with iNPH. Plain language summary Endoscopic third ventriculostomy for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus Background Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid which circulates around the brain and spinal cord and through spaces called ventricles within the brain. It protects the brain, supplies nutrients and removes waste products. Normally, its production and reabsorption are tightly controlled. In idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), there is an increase in the volume of CSF for unknown reasons. This causes the ventricles to enlarge and eventually leads to damage to surrounding brain tissue. It usually occurs in older people. Its characteristic symptoms are deterioration in balance and gait, urinary incontinence and cognitive decline. It is one of the less common causes of dementia. It is thought that the symptoms of some patients with iNPH can be improved by an operation to drain away the excess CSF. This has usually been done by inserting a tube (a shunt) to drain fluid into the chest or abdomen (ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunts). However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of this approach and a significant number of patients develop complications or need further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a newer and less invasive surgical approach which involves making a small hole in the floor of one of the ventricles. Review question We undertook this review to try to determine how safe and effective ETV is for treating iNPH. We did this by looking for any randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) which compared ETV to no surgery or to insertion of a shunt. Results We searched for trials which had been reported by August 2014. We were able to include only one RCT with 42 participants in the review. It compared ETV to insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, but unfortunately a type of shunt which is not often used in standard practice. We compared the numbers of patients whose symptoms improved with each treatment, but the result was too imprecise to allow us to draw a conclusion. In the shunting group, 19% of the patients had a surgical complication, while there were no complications in the ETV group. Due to the small number of participants, we could not be sure whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of the evidence to be very low because there was a high risk of bias in the trial results, because the results were so imprecise, and because several outcomes measured in the trial were not fully reported. Conclusions Doctors and patients should be aware of the limitations of the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of this operation for iNPH. There should be more and larger trials to compare the different treatment options.

AB: Abstract - Background Clinical guidelines recommend outpatient care for the majority of people with an eating disorder. The optimal use of inpatient treatment or combination of inpatient and partial hospital care is disputed and practice varies widely. Objectives To assess the effects of treatment setting (inpatient, partial hospitalisation, or outpatient) on the reduction of symptoms and increase in remission rates in people with: 1. Anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa; 2. Bulimia nervosa and other eating disorders. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 2 July 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 20 November 2015). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (6 July 2018). We ran a forward citation search on the Web of Science to identify additional reports citing any of the included studies, and screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews identified during our searches. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that tested the efficacy of inpatient, outpatient, or partial hospital settings for treatment of eating disorder in adults, adolescents, and children, whose diagnoses were determined according to the DSM‐5, or other internationally accepted diagnostic criteria. We excluded trials of treatment setting for medical or psychiatric complications or comorbidities (e.g. hypokalaemia, depression) of an eating disorder. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane procedures to select studies, extract and analyse data, and interpret and present results. We extracted data according to the DSM‐5 criteria. We used the Cochrane tool to assess risk of bias. We used the mean (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data outcomes, and the risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes. We included the 95% confidence interval (CI) with each result. We presented the quality of the evidence and estimate of effect for weight or body mass index (BMI) and acceptability (number who completed treatment), in a 'Summary of findings' table for the comparison for which we had sufficient data to conduct a meta‐analysis. Main results We included five trials in our review. Four trials included a total of 511 participants with anorexia nervosa, and one trial had 55 participants with bulimia nervosa. Three trials are awaiting classification, and may be included in future versions of this review. We assessed a risk of bias from lack of blinding of participants and therapists in all trials, and unclear risk for allocation concealment and randomisation in one study. We had planned four comparisons, and had data for meta‐analyses for one. For anorexia nervosa, there may be little or no difference between specialist inpatient care and active outpatient or combined brief hospital and outpatient care in weight gain at 12 months after the start of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.49 to 0.05; 2 trials, 232 participants; low‐quality evidence). People may be more likely to complete treatment when randomised to outpatient care settings, but this finding is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.88; 3 trials, 319 participants; very low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for these outcomes because of risks of bias, small numbers of participants and events, and variable level of specialist expertise and intensity of treatment. We had no data, or data from only one trial for the primary outcomes for each of the other three comparisons. No trials measured weight or acceptance of treatment for anorexia nervosa, when comparing inpatient care provided by a specialist eating disorder service and health professionals and a waiting list, no active treatment, or treatment as usual. There was no clear difference in weight gain between settings, and only slightly more acceptance for the partial hospital setting over specialist inpatient care for weight restoration in anorexia nervosa. There was no clear difference in weight gain or acceptability of treatment between specialist inpatient care and partial hospital care for bulimia nervosa, and other binge eating disorders. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether any treatment setting was superior for treating people with moderately severe (or less) anorexia nervosa, or other eating disorders. More research is needed for all comparisons of inpatient care versus alternate care. Plain language summary Inpatient hospital care compared to outpatient or day care for people with eating disorders Why is this review important? International clinical practice guidelines recommend that overall, people with eating disorders should receive their treatment in an outpatient setting. Most people also prefer to avoid a hospital admission, as it takes more time and resources. However, it is not known if outpatient care is as effective as more intensive inpatient or partial (day) hospital care, or if it is more acceptable for people. Those who are at medical or psychiatric risk of harm or suicide, and those with anorexia nervosa who are severely underweight or rapidly losing weight may not be safe in an outpatient setting. Who will be interested in this review? People with lived experience of eating disorders and people who care for them will be interested in this review. Which studies were included in the review? We searched medical databases and trial registers to find randomised controlled studies that compared inpatient care to partial hospital care or outpatient care, alone or in combination, to July 2018. We included four trials that included 511 people with anorexia nervosa, and one trial of 55 people with bulimia nervosa. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was not enough evidence from trials to support any one setting for people with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorders. There was no clear difference in weight gain for people with anorexia nervosa who were treated in different settings, but they seemed more likely to complete treatment when some or all of it was offered in settings outside the hospital. The evidence was low or very low‐quality, so we are uncertain about these results. What should happen next? We need more trials comparing inpatient to outpatient or day care for people with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, when it is medically safe to consider less intensive care settings.

AB: Abstract - Background Galantamine is a specific, competitive, and reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Objectives To assess the clinical effects of galantamine in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (AD), and potential moderators of effect. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, last updated on 25 April 2005 using the terms galanthamin*, galantamin* and Reminyl. Published reviews were inspected for further sources. Additional information was collected from unpublished clinical research reports for galantamine obtained from Janssen and from http://www.clinicalstudyresults.org/. Selection criteria Trials selected were randomised, double‐blind, parallel‐group comparisons of galantamine with placebo for a treatment duration of greater than 4 weeks in subjects with MCI or AD. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by the reviewers and pooled where appropriate and possible. Outcomes of interest include the clinical global impression of change (CIBIC‐plus or CGIC), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐cognitive sub scale (ADAS‐cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living (ADCS‐ADL), Disability Assessment for Dementia scale (DAD) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Potential moderating variables of treatment effect assessed included trial duration, dose, and diagnosis of possible versus probable Alzheimer's disease. Main results Ten trials with a total 6805 subjects were included in the analysis.   Treatment with galantamine led to a significantly greater proportion of subjects with improved or unchanged global rating scale rating (k = 8 studies), at all dosing levels except for 8 mg/d . Confidence intervals for the ORs overlapped across the dose range of 16 mg to 36 mg per day, with point estimates of 1.6 ‐ 1.8 when analysed with the intention‐to‐treat sample.   Treatment with galantamine also led to significantly greater reduction in ADAS‐cog score at all dosing levels (k = 8), with greater effect over six months compared to three months. Confidence intervals again overlapped. Point estimate of effect was lower for 8 mg/d but similar for 16 mg to 36 mg per day. For example, treatment effect for 24 mg/d over six months was 3.1 point reduction in ADAS‐cog (95%CI 2.6‐3.7, k = 4, ITT).   ADCS‐ADL, DAD and NPI were reported only in a small proportion of trials: all showed significant treatment effect in some individual trials at least. Confidence interval of treatment effect for the one trial recruiting patients with possible AD overlapped with the other seven recruiting patients with probable AD. Galantamine's adverse effects appeared similar to those of other cholinesterase inhibitors and to be dose related.   Prolong release / once daily formulation of galantamine at 16 ‐ 24mg/d was found to have similar efficacy and side‐effect profile as the equivalent twice‐daily regime.   Data from the two MCI trials suggest marginal clinical benefit, but a yet unexplained excess in death rate. Authors' conclusions Subjects in these trials were similar to those seen in earlier anti dementia AD trials, consisting primarily of mildly to moderately impaired outpatients. Galantamine's effect on more severely impaired subjects has not yet been assessed.   Nevertheless, this review shows consistent positive effects for galantamine for trials of three to six months' duration. Although there was not a statistically significant dose‐response effect, doses above 8 mg/d were, for the most part, consistently statistically significant.   Galantamine's safety profile in AD is similar to that of other cholinesterase inhibitors with respect to cholinergically mediated gastrointestinal symptoms. It appears that doses of 16 mg/d were best tolerated in the single trial where medication was titrated over a four week period, and because this dose showed statistically indistinguishable efficacy with higher doses, it is probably most preferable initially. Longer term use of galantamine has not been assessed in a controlled fashion.   Galantamine use in MCI is not recommended due to its association with an excess death rate. Plain language summary Galantamine improves global and cognitive symptoms at doses of 16 mg/day or greater, in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, for at least 6 months Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative illness, affecting thinking and memory. Galantamine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that inhibits the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and may have other actions on nicotinic receptors as well. The review finds that galantamine was more effective than placebo in improving cognitive function. A greater proportion of people taking galantamine than of those taking placebo was rated as improved or not changed after three to six months. There was evidence of improvement on measures of activities of daily living and behavioral symptoms. Longer‐term controlled studies have yet to be performed or published. Data from the two MCI trials suggest marginal clinical benefit, but a yet unexplained excess in death rate.

AB: Abstract - Background Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first‐line treatment in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer antidepressive agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug‐approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand‐searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active antidepressive agents (including non‐conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials. Main results A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in the meta‐analysis.Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95% confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost‐effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression. Plain language summary Milnacipran versus other antidepressive agents for depression Major depression, also known as major depressive disorder or unipolar depression, is a common mental disorder characterised by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy pleasurable activities. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life. Antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first‐line treatment for major depression in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care in some countries. This systematic review investigated the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran compared to that of other antidepressive agents in the acute phase treatment of major depression. A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (2277 participants) were included in this review. When we brought together the results of approximately 2000 patients, we were unable to say whether milnacipran is better, worse or the same when compared to other antidepressive agents used in practice in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. However, there is some evidence that fewer people taking milnacipran stop taking the drug ('drop out') due to side effects and fewer people taking milnacipran experience side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth or constipation than do people who take tricyclic antidepressants.

AB: Abstract - Background Anorexia nervosa is a disorder with high morbidity and significant mortality. It is most common in young adult women, in whom the incidence may be increasing. The focus of treatment has moved to an outpatient setting, and a number of differing psychological therapies are presently used in treatment. This is an update of a Cochrane review which was last published in 2008. Objectives To assess the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents treated in an outpatient setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (16 July 2014). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We screened reference lists of all included studies and sent letters to identified, notable researchers requesting information on unpublished or ongoing studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of one or more individual outpatient psychological therapies for adults with anorexia nervosa, as defined by DSM‐5 or similar international criteria. Data collection and analysis We selected a range of outcome variables, including physical state, severity of eating disorder attitudes and beliefs, interpersonal function, and general psychiatric symptom severity. Continuous outcome data comparisons used the mean or standardised mean difference (MD or SMD), and binary outcome comparisons used the risk ratio (RR). Two review authors (PH and AC or ST) extracted data independently. Main results We identified 10 trials from the search, with a total of 599 anorexia nervosa participants, and included them in the review. Seven had been identified in the previous versions of this review and we now include three new trials. We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible, and six ongoing trials are new for this update. Two of the 10 trials included children. Trials tested diverse psychological therapies and comparability was poor. Risks of bias were mostly evident through lack of blinded outcome assessments (in 60% of studies) and incomplete data reporting (attrition bias). The results suggest that treatment as usual (TAU) when delivered by a non‐eating‐disorder specialist or similar may be less efficacious than focal psychodynamic therapy. This was suggested for a primary outcome of recovery by achievement of a good or intermediate outcome on the Morgan and Russell Scale (RR 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 40 participants; very low‐quality evidence). However there were no differences between cognitive analytic therapy and TAU for this outcome (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00; 2 RCTs, 71 participants; very low‐quality evidence), nor for body mass index (BMI). There were no differences in overall dropout rates between individual psychological therapies and TAU. Two trials found a non‐specific specialist therapy (Specialist Supportive Clinical Management) or an Optimised TAU delivered by therapists with eating disorder expertise was similar in outcomes to cognitive behaviour therapy (BMI MD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.91 to 0.91; 197 participants, low‐quality evidence). When comparing individual psychological therapies with each other, no specific treatment was consistently superior to any other specific approach. Dietary advice as a control arm had a 100% non‐completion rate in one trial (35 participants). None of the trials identified any adverse effects. Insufficient power was problematic for the majority of trials. Authors' conclusions There was a suggestion in one trial that focal psychodynamic therapy might be superior to TAU, but this is in the context of TAU performing poorly. An alternative control condition of dietary advice alone appeared to be unacceptable, but again this is based on just one trial. Owing to the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents. Larger RCTs of longer treatment duration and follow‐up are needed. Plain language summary Outpatient psychological therapy for adults with anorexia Why is this review important? Anorexia nervosa is a severe and disabling mental health disorder of self starvation. In the general population the lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa may be as high as 5 in 100 women. About one in 10 people with anorexia nervosa is male. Psychological therapies are the main treatment and most people are treated as outpatients. A number of different types of therapy are used, from dynamic (where past issues are explored) to very directive cognitive‐behavioural therapies (where specific advice is given and people are required to keep records of their eating behaviour). It is important to know which psychological therapy is most likely to help people recover. This review aimed to assess evidence about the effects of individual psychological therapy (therapy provided to one person as opposed to a group) delivered in outpatient settings to older adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to people with lived experience of anorexia nervosa and people involved in their care. Which studies were included in the review? We used search databases to ﬁnd randomised controlled studies of individual psychological therapy delivered in outpatient settings to older adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa (completed up to July 16 2014). We included 10 trials that covered 599 people with anorexia nervosa. These trials had some limitations: they were small and often lost a lot of people. The investigators and people involved usually knew which treatment group they were in, which may have affected how they reported results. The trials used different types of psychological therapies. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was a limited amount of very low‐quality evidence to suggest that people might do better when receiving focal psychodynamic therapy compared to no treatment or treatment as usual. With one exception, we found little difference between specific psychological therapies. Most therapies appeared as acceptable as any other approach, except for dietary advice which had a 100% non‐completion rate in one small trial. Because of the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents. What should happen next? We need more large multicentre randomised controlled trials of commonly‐used psychological therapies in older adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa.

AB: Abstract - Background Long‐term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide. These individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression, sometimes directly related to their illness or medical care (e.g. health‐related anxiety). There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. Therapies designed for children and adolescents without medical issues may or may not be appropriate for use with those who have long‐term physical conditions. Objectives This review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison with controls (treatment‐as‐usual, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or non‐psychological treatment) for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 27 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to May 2016). In addition, we searched the Web of Science (Core Collection) (12 October 2018) and conducted a cited reference search for reports of all included trials. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and grey literature. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials and cross‐over trials of psychological therapies for treating anxiety or depression in children with long‐term physical conditions were included. Data collection and analysis Abstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two authors. Discrepancies were addressed by a third author. Odds ratio (OR) was used for comparing dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) for comparing continuous data. Meta‐analysis was undertaken when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar. Otherwise, narrative analysis of data was undertaken. Main results Twenty‐eight RCTs and one cross‐over trial with 1349 participants were included in the review. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high‐income countries. For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short‐term depression (versus any control), there was low‐quality evidence from 16 trials involving 1121 participants suggesting that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.03; I 2  = 79%). For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short‐term anxiety (versus any control), there was inadequate evidence of moderate‐quality from 13 studies involving 578 participants to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions (SMD ‐0.26, CI ‐0.59 to 0.07, I 2  = 72%). Planned sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken for risk of bias due to the small number of trials that rated high for each domain. Additional sensitivity analysis demonstrated that psychological interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than psychological therapies designed to improve other symptoms or general coping. There was some suggestion from subgroup analyses that they type of intervention (Chi² = 14.75, df = 5 (P = 0.01), I² = 66.1%), the severity of depression (Chi² = 23.29, df = 4 (P = 0.0001), I² = 82.8%) and the type of long‐term physical condition (Chi² = 10.55, df = 4 (P = 0.03), I² = 62.1%) may have an impact on the overall treatment effect.There was qualitative (reported), but not quantitative evidence confirming the acceptability of selected psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. There was low‐quality evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions in improving quality of life (SMD 1.13, CI 0.44 to 1.82, I 2  = 89%) and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions (SMD ‐0.34, CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.06, I 2  = 70%), but only in the short term. There was inadequate low‐quality evidence to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions at improving functioning in either the short term or long term. No trials of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety were identified and only two trials reported adverse effects; these were unrelated to psychological therapies. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, results were heterogeneous, and only one trial had an available protocol. Authors' conclusions A limited number of trials of variable quality have been undertaken to assess whether psychological therapies are effective for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. According to the available evidence, therapies specifically designed to treat anxiety or depression (especially those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) may be more likely to work in children and adolescents who have mild to moderate levels of symptoms of these disorders, at least in the short term. There is a dearth of therapies specifically designed to treat health‐related anxiety in this age group. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions Why is this review important? More than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? Which studies were included in the review? We searched a number of databases to find all high‐quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long‐term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty‐nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. What does the evidence from the review tell us? A handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long‐term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety in this population. What should happen next? Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.

AB: Abstract - Background Major depression and other depressive conditions are common in people with cancer. These conditions are not easily detectable in clinical practice, due to the overlap between medical and psychiatric symptoms, as described by diagnostic manuals such as the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  ( DSM ) and  International Classification of Diseases  ( ICD ). Moreover, it is particularly challenging to distinguish between pathological and normal reactions to such a severe illness. Depressive symptoms, even in subthreshold manifestations, have been shown to have a negative impact in terms of quality of life, compliance with anti‐cancer treatment, suicide risk and likely even the mortality rate for the cancer itself. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in this population are few and often report conflicting results. Objectives To assess the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in adults (aged 18 years or older) with cancer (any site and stage). Search methods We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to June week 4 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 2017 week 27) and PsycINFO Ovid (1987 to July week 4 2017). We additionally handsearched the trial databases of the most relevant national, international and pharmaceutical company trial registers and drug‐approving agencies for published, unpublished and ongoing controlled trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo, or antidepressants versus other antidepressants, in adults (aged 18 years or above) with any primary diagnosis of cancer and depression (including major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder or depressive symptoms in the absence of a formal diagnosis). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a form specifically designed for the aims of this review. The two authors compared the data extracted and then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double‐entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, outcome measures for each time point of interest, cost analysis and sponsorship by a drug company. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We retrieved a total of 10 studies (885 participants), seven of which contributed to the meta‐analysis for the primary outcome. Four of these compared antidepressants and placebo, two compared two antidepressants, and one three‐armed study compared two antidepressants and placebo. In this update we included one additional unpublished study. These new data contributed to the secondary analysis, while the results of the primary analysis remained unchanged. For acute‐phase treatment response (6 to 12 weeks), we found no difference between antidepressants as a class and placebo on symptoms of depression measured both as a continuous outcome (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.01 to 0.11, five RCTs, 266 participants; very low certainty evidence) and as a proportion of people who had depression at the end of the study (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08, five RCTs, 417 participants; very low certainty evidence). No trials reported data on follow‐up response (more than 12 weeks). In head‐to‐head comparisons we only retrieved data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants, showing no difference between these two classes (SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.18, three RCTs, 237 participants; very low certainty evidence). No clear evidence of a beneficial effect of antidepressants versus either placebo or other antidepressants emerged from our analyses of the secondary efficacy outcomes (dichotomous outcome, response at 6 to 12 weeks, very low certainty evidence). In terms of dropouts due to any cause, we found no difference between antidepressants as a class compared with placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38, seven RCTs, 479 participants; very low certainty evidence), and between SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30, three RCTs, 237 participants). We downgraded the certainty (quality) of the evidence because the included studies were at an unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting, imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals, and inconsistency due to statistical or clinical heterogeneity. Authors' conclusions Despite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were very few and of low quality. This review found very low certainty evidence for the effects of these drugs compared with placebo. On the basis of these results, clear implications for practice cannot be deduced. The use of antidepressants in people with cancer should be considered on an individual basis and, considering the lack of head‐to‐head data, the choice of which agent to prescribe may be based on the data on antidepressant efficacy in the general population of individuals with major depression, also taking into account that data on medically ill patients suggest a positive safety profile for the SSRIs. To better inform clinical practice, there is an urgent need for large, simple, randomised, pragmatic trials comparing commonly used antidepressants versus placebo in people with cancer who have depressive symptoms, with or without a formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Plain language summary Antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people with cancer The issue   Depressive states are frequent among people suffering from cancer. Often depressive symptoms are a normal reaction or a direct effect of such a severe and life‐threatening illness. It is therefore not easy to establish when depressive symptoms become a proper disorder and need to be treated with drugs. Current scientific literature reveals that depressive symptoms, even when mild, can have a relevant impact on the course of cancer, reducing people's overall quality of life and affecting their compliance with anti‐cancer treatment, as well as possibly increasing the likelihood of death. The aim of the review   It is important to assess the possible beneficial role of antidepressants in adults (aged 18 years or above) with cancer. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in patients with cancer at any site and stage. What are the main findings?   We systematically reviewed ten studies assessing the efficacy of antidepressants, for a total of 885 participants. The evidence is current to 3 July 2017. Due to the small number of people in the studies, and issues with how the studies reported what was done, there is uncertainty over whether antidepressants were better than placebo in terms of depressive symptoms after 6 to 12 weeks of treatment. We did not have enough evidence to determine how well antidepressants were tolerated in comparison with placebo. Our results did not show whether any particular antidepressant was better than any other in terms of both beneficial and harmful effects. To better inform clinical practice, we need large studies which randomly assign people to different treatments. Currently, we cannot draw reliable conclusions about the effects of antidepressants on depression in people with cancer. Certainty of the evidence   The certainty of the evidence was very low because of a lack of information about how the studies were designed, low numbers of people in the analysis of results, and differences between the characteristics of the studies and their results. What are the conclusions?   Despite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were very few and of low quality. This review found very low certainty evidence for the effects of these drugs compared with placebo.

AB: Abstract - Background The health benefits of physical activity and exercise are well documented and these effects could help people with schizophrenia. Objectives To determine the mental health effects of exercise/physical activity programmes for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2008) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We also inspected references within relevant papers. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention where physical activity or exercise was considered to be the main or active ingredient with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, quality assessed and data extracted. For binary outcomes we calculated a fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, the weighted number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was also calculated. For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. We synthesised non‐skewed data from valid scales using a weighted mean difference (WMD). Main results Three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials assessed the effects of exercise on physical and mental health. Overall numbers leaving the trials were similar. Two trials compared exercise to standard care and both found exercise to significantly improve negative symptoms of mental state (Mental Health Inventory Depression:1RCT, n=10, MD 17.50 CI 6.70 to 28.30, PANSS negative: 1RCT, n=10, MD ‐8.50 CI ‐11.11 to ‐5.89). No absolute effects were found for positive symptoms of mental state. Physical health improved significantly in the exercise group compared to those in standard care (1RCT, n=13, MD 79.50 CI 33.82 to 125.18), but no effect on peoples' weight/BMI was apparent. One trial compared exercise with yoga and found that yoga had a better outcome for mental state (PANSS total: 1RCT, n=41, MD 14.95 CI 2.60 to 27.30). The same trial also found those in the yoga group had significantly better quality of life scores (WHOQOL Physical: 1RCT, n=41, MD ‐9.22 CI ‐18.86 to 0.42). Adverse effects (AIMS total scores) were, however, similar. Authors' conclusions Results of this Cochrane review are similar to existing reviews that have examined the health benefits of exercise in this population. Although studies included in this review are small and used various measures of physical and mental health, results indicated that regular exercise programmes are possible in this population, and that they can have healthful effects on both the physical and mental health and well‐being of individuals with schizophrenia. Larger randomised studies are required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. Plain language summary Exercise Therapy for Schizophrenia Regular exercise and physical activity is thought to improve both physical and mental health. Although only three studies are included in this review, the overall results show that regular exercise can help some individuals with schizophrenia improve their physical and mental health and well‐being. Future studies should address how best to help individuals with schizophrenia begin, and continue to exercise.

AB: Abstract - Background Aggressive, agitated or violent behaviour due to psychosis constitutes an emergency psychiatric treatment where fast‐acting interventions are required. Risperidone is a widely accessible antipsychotic that can be used to manage psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation. Objectives To examine whether oral risperidone alone is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (up to April 2017); this register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid use of risperidone and other drugs, combinations of drugs or placebo for people exhibiting aggression or agitation (or both) thought to be due to psychosis. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and used a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a ’Summary of findings’ tables. Main results The review now contains data from nine trials (total n = 582) reporting on five comparisons. Due to risk of bias, small size of trials, indirectness of outcome measures and a paucity of investigated and reported 'pragmatic' outcomes, evidence was graded as very‐low quality. None of the included studies provided useable data on our primary outcome 'tranquillisation or asleep' by 30 minutes, repeated need for tranquillisation or any economic outcomes. Data were available for our other main outcomes of agitation or aggression, needing restraint, and incidence of adverse effects. Risperidone versus haloperidol (up to 24 hours follow‐up) For the outcome, specific behaviour ‐ agitation, no clear difference was found between risperidone and haloperidol in terms of efficacy, measured as at least 50% reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ‐ Psychotic Agitation Sub‐score (PANSS‐PAS) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.26; participants = 124; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence) and no effect was observed for need to use restraints (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.21; participants = 28; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Incidence of adverse effects was similar between treatment groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.66; participants = 124; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Risperidone versus olanzapine One small trial (n = 29) reported useable data for the comparison risperidone versus olanzapine. No effect was observed for agitation measured as PANSS‐PAS endpoint score at two hours (MD 2.50, 95% CI ‐2.46 to 7.46; very low‐quality evidence); need to use restraints at four days (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.28; very‐low quality evidence); specific movement disorders measured as Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS) endpoint score at four days (MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.83; very low‐quality evidence). Risperidone versus quetiapine One trial reported (n = 40) useable data for the comparison risperidone versus quetiapine. Aggression was measured using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) endpoint score at two weeks. A clear difference, favouring quetiapine was observed (MD 1.80, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.40; very‐low quality evidence). No evidence of a difference between treatment groups could be observed for incidence of akathisia after 24 hours (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.06; very low‐quality evidence). Two participants allocated to risperidone and one allocated to quetiapine experienced myocardial ischaemia during the trial. Risperidone versus risperidone + oxcarbazepine One trial (n = 68) measured agitation using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ‐ Excited Component.(PANSS‐EC) endpoint score and found a clear difference, favouring the combination treatment at one week (MD 2.70, 95% CI 0.42 to 4.98; very low‐quality evidence), but no effect was observed for global state using Clinical Global Impression ‐ Improvement (CGI‐I) endpoint score at one week (MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.21; very‐low quality evidence). Incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms after 24 hours was similar between treatment groups (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.14; very‐low quality evidence). Risperidone versus risperidone + valproic acid Two trials compared risperidone with a combination of risperidone plus valproic acid. No clear differences between the treatment groups were observed for aggression (MOAS endpoint score at three days: MD 1.07, 95% CI ‐0.20 to 2.34; participants = 54; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence) or incidence of akathisia after 24 hours: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; participants = 122; studies = 2; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Overall, results for the main outcomes show no real effect for risperidone. The only data available for use in this review are from nine under‐sampled trials and the evidence available is of very low quality. This casts uncertainty on the role of risperidone in rapid tranquillisation for people with psychosis‐induced aggression. High‐quality pragmatic RCTs are feasible and are needed before clear recommendations can be drawn on the use of risperidone for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation. Plain language summary Risperidone as a means of calming people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis Background People with psychosis may experience hearing voices (hallucinations) or abnormal thoughts (delusions), which can make the person frightened, distressed, and agitated. Experiencing such emotions can sometimes lead to aggressive behaviour. This poses a challenge and dilemma for staff. Mental health professionals have to diagnose and deliver the best available treatment to prevent the risk of harm to both the patient and/or others, the faster the better. Risperidone is a medication taken by mouth, widely used for treating people manage the symptoms of psychosis. As well as being an antipsychotic (preventing psychosis), it also could calm people down or help them to sleep. Aim of the review This review looks at whether the antipsychotic, risperidone, could be a fast, effective treatment for people who are agitated or aggressive as a result of having psychosis. Searches The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia ran searches of their specialised register for randomised trials that looked at the effects of giving risperidone alone compared with giving either placebo (dummy treatment) or other treatments to people who are aggressive or agitated as a results of having psychosis. The latest date of searching was April 2017. Results Nine studies, with 582 participants, are included in the review but the information provided is poor in quality and tended to provide information only partially relevant to the main aim of this review, particularly a lack of information regarding immediate (i.e. under one hour after treatment) calming effects and the need for repeated tranquillisation. Economic data were also not reported. In the trials, risperidone was compared to other antipsychotics, which included haloperidol, olanzapine and quetiapine. The review found risperidone was no better or worse than haloperidol for calming aggression within 24 hours, and that two weeks after treatment, people receiving risperidone had higher (worse) scores on scales measuring levels of aggression than those receiving quetiapine. Both these results, however, were graded as very low‐quality evidence. One small study found a combination of antipsychotics (risperidone plus oxcarbazepine) was better than risperidone alone at reducing levels of agitation but these data were collected after one week and again, this evidence was rated as very low quality. No clear differences in the incidence of side effects such as movement disorders were observed. Conclusions The review authors conclude that at the moment, there is weak, unclear evidence regarding the use of risperidone for calming people who are aggressive due to psychosis, and no firm conclusions can be made. Therefore, health professionals and people with mental health problems are left without clear evidence‐based guidance. However, good quality trials are possible and more research is needed to help people dealing with psychosis‐induced aggression consider and understand which medication is better at calming aggression, has fewer side effects and works quickly.

AB: Abstract - Background Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. Main results We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases. Plain language summary Psychological therapies versus medication for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults Why is this review important? Panic disorder is common and harmful to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and medication (usually antidepressants or benzodiazepines) are effective against panic disorder. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the superiority and acceptability of these two forms of treatment, and such a review is necessary to improve treatment planning for this disorder. Who will be interested in this review? Adult patients, professionals working in mental health services, and general practitioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? The present review aims to answer the following questions: • Are psychological therapies more effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines? • Are psychological therapies more acceptable than antidepressants or benzodiazepines? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases to find all trials published between 1950 and September 2015 comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants or benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. To be included in the review, the studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the review. We rated the overall quality of the evidence from these studies as very low to moderate. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The superiority or inferiority of psychological therapies over drugs remains unclear with regard to treatment effectiveness and acceptability. None of the studies reported information regarding long‐term effectiveness and quality of life. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that future research should use less biased psychological therapies, evaluate long‐term outcomes, and report information related to the risk of study bias.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between antipsychotic drugs, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are sometimes perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. Objectives To review the effects in clinical response of flupenthixol and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2010). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared flupenthixol with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes one randomised trial from mainland China with 153 participants that lasted two months and compared flupenthixol with chlorpromazine. The exact methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment were not reported, and medication was provided in an open manner. There were no data on the outcomes that we had a priori selected for a 'Summary of findings' table. There was no significant difference between flupenthixol and chlorpromazine in the participants' general mental state at endpoint as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score (1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), n = 153, MD 2.20 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.25 to 5.65). Chlorpromazine was associated with significantly less dizziness (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.12 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23); dystonia (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.29 95% CI 0.13 to 0.45); unsteady gait (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.46 95% CI 0.28 to 0.64); reduced facial expression (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.27 95% CI 0.09 to 0.45); restlessness (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.69 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93); rigidity (elbow) (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.48 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68); and tremor (1 RCT, n = 153, MD 0.56 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78). Chlorpromazine produced more dryness of mouth than flupenthixol (1 RCT, n = 153, MD ‐0.14 95% CI ‐0.25 to ‐0.03). Authors' conclusions The evidence base of flupenthixol versus low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics is currently restricted to one randomised comparison with chlorpromazine. The few reported data do not suggest a difference in efficacy, but flupenthixol appeared to produce more movement disorders and dizziness, while chlorpromazine was associated with the anticholinergic side effect ‐ dryness of mouth. More trials are needed to make conclusions about the relative effects of flupenthixol and low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Flupenthixol compared with low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics Flupenthixol was first made available in the UK in 1965 and it has been used to treat schizophrenia for nearly five decades. It is available both as a tablet and a long‐acting injection. Having been investigated in numerous studies, flupenthixol was found to be effective and well tolerated by people with schizophrenia. The main side effects are shaking, restlessness or the inability to sit still, a dry mouth and some weight gain. Although this drug has been available for decades, few systematic reviews exist on flupenthixol. The effects of this drug in helping people cope with the symptoms of schizophrenia are not currently measured, quantified and known. The review could include only one small study, which was limited and 13 years old. The number as well as the quality of the study was low; for the main outcomes of interest the authors could not rate the quality of evidence at all, as the study did not report on the outcomes of interest for the 'Summary of findings' table. Flupenthixol was compared with chlorpromazine. There was no clear difference in efficacy, nor was there clear information on: increasing their use of services; people’s satisfaction with treatment; quality of life; or costs and cost effectiveness. Flupenthixol is widely available and inexpensive. It is perhaps understandable that it remains one of many drugs used for treating people with serious mental illnesses. This is because the use of flupenthixol is based more on clinical experience, and the decisions of psychiatrists are based on large scale research studies and evidence‐based information. The effectiveness and benefits of flupenthixol over chlorpromazine remain largely unknown and incomplete. Large randomised trials could be helpful in increasing knowledge about this drug. This plain language summary has been written by Benjamin Gray, Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness.

It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia as an alternative or adjunctive treatment. Objectives To systematically assess the effects of yoga versus non‐standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialised Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia and comparing yoga with non‐standard care. We included trials that met our selection criteria and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis The review team independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect models for analyses. We examined data for heterogeneity (I 2  technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings’ table for seven main outcomes of interest using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results We were able to include six studies (586 participants). Non‐standard care consisted solely of another type of exercise programme. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There was a clear difference in the outcome leaving the study early (6 RCTs, n=586, RR 0.64 CI 0.49 to 0.83,  medium quality evidence ) in favour of the yoga group. There were no clear differences between groups for the remaining outcomes. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.81 CI 0.62 to 1.07,  low quality evidence ), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.90 CI 0.78 to 1.04,  low quality evidence ), quality of life (mental health) (average change 36‐Item Short Form Survey (SF‐36) quality‐of‐life sub‐scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD ‐5.30 CI ‐17.78 to 7.18,  low quality evidence ), physical health, (average change WHOQOL‐BREF physical‐health sub‐scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD 9.22 CI ‐0.42 to 18.86,  low quality evidence ). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. There were a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included relapse, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions We found minimal differences between yoga and non‐standard care, the latter consisting of another exercise comparator, which could be broadly considered aerobic exercise. Outcomes were largely based on single studies with limited sample sizes and short‐term follow‐up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality ‐ too weak to indicate that yoga is superior or inferior to non‐standard care control for management of people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Yoga versus non‐standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga an effective add‐on treatment compared to other add‐on treatments for people with schizophrenia? Background Yoga comes from ancient India and involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise, improving strength, flexibility, co‐ordination, endurance, and breathing control and concentration. Yoga has also been shown to reduce stress and promote health and feelings of well‐being. Yoga has been used as a complementary therapy for many health conditions, including improving blood pressure control as well as mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Some research suggests that yoga could also be of benefit as an add‐on treatment to reduce the complex symptoms of the serious mental illness schizophrenia (such as hearing voices, seeing things, lack of interest in people and activities, tiredness, loss of emotions and withdrawal), and improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. The effectiveness of yoga versus other available (non‐drug and non‐talking therapy) add‐on treatments is under‐researched. Searching for evidence We ran electronic searches for trials (latest search was in March 2017) for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive yoga or another add‐on treatment. One thousand and thirty four records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found Six trials with 586 participants met the review requirements and provided useable data. Other add‐on treatments consisted of other forms of exercise only. There is little evidence currently available, is low quality, and suggests that yoga is no more effective than other add‐on treatments for schizophrenia. Conclusions Current evidence from randomised controlled trials shows yoga is no more effective than other add on treatments for schizophrenia, but the only available comparators to yoga were other forms of exercise. The evidence is weak as the number of studies available was small, and only short‐term follow‐up was reported. More, larger, and long‐term trials that compare yoga with other alternatives to exercise are therefore necessary.

AB: Abstract - Background The behavioural problems of people with dementia are often considered as one of the most challenging issues in caring. Special Care Units (SCUs) have flourished since the 1980s with the aim of taking care of dementia patients, usually those with Alzheimer's disease, and in particular for those with behavioural problems. Although lacking a standard definition, SCUs are usually situated within nursing homes and commonly include the features of trained staffing, special programming, a modified physical environment, and family involvement. The costs of SCUs are commonly higher than for 'standard' nursing home care. However, evaluations of the outcomes of SCUs have yielded conflicting results. A systematic review of this evidence is therefore warranted. Objectives To evaluate the effect of SCUs on behavioural problems, mood, use of restraints and psychotropic medication in patients with dementia. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library,  MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL on 6 September 2007 using the search terms: Special Care Units or SCUs. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from major healthcare databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and LILACS as well as many ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the outcomes of SCUs were compared against traditional nursing units (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities) were included. Data collection and analysis Two reviewing authors independently read the full reports of the potentially eligible studies and selected those that met the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussions among the two reviewing authors. Final consensus was reached with input from a third member of the team when necessary. Main results No RCTs meeting the selection criteria were identified. Since it is unlikely, for ethical and practical reasons that an RCT of SCUs will be conducted, a systematic review of non‐RCTs using the same protocol and criteria was conducted. There were eight non‐RCTs that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Only four studies had data which could be extracted for pooling in meta‐analysis.  Differences between comparator groups in these nonRCTs ? for example in severity of dementia ‐ were not adequately adjusted for and were common in the trial which accounted for almost all of the positive outcomes of SCUs (Nobili, 2006) All of the results of the outcomes came only from single studies except for "physical restraint use" at 6 months, which included data from two studies.  A small improvement in total Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, favouring SCU was noted in one study at 6, 12 and 18 months.  The use of physical restraints was less common in SCUs at 6 and 12 months (OR= 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.80), p=0.006; and OR=0.49 (0.27 to 0.88), p=0.02 respectively).  Patients in SCUs were less depressed at 3 months than those in traditional nursing home (WMD ‐6.30 (‐7.88 to ‐4.72) Cornell points, p<0.00001). There was only one observation that favoured the control group: a small but significant effect favouring traditional nursing home care was observed at 6 months in the mean number of psychotropic medications used (WMD 0.20, CI 0.00 to 0.40, z=1.96, P=0.05). Authors' conclusions There are no identified RCTs investigating the effects of SCUs on behavioural symptoms in dementia, and  no strong evidence of benefit from the available non‐RCTs.  It is probably more important to implement best practice than to provide a specialized care environment.  The routine collection of data on behaviour, restraint and psychotropic drug use across multiple nursing home settings offers the best modality for formal evaluation of the benefit or otherwise of SCUs. Plain language summary There is limited evidence to support the assumption that the care of people with dementia in special care units is superior to care in traditional nursing units. There is limited evidence to support the assumption that the care of people with dementia in special care units (SCUs) is superior to care in traditional nursing units. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be found comparing the effect of SCUs against traditional nursing units in managing agitated behaviours in people suffering from dementia. This review has examined the results of non‐RCTs. The findings about the outcomes of this review arise just from one study except for the outcome of "physical restraint use" at 6 months, which includes data from two studies. Selection bias is a major problem in non‐RCTs, and confounds the limited evidence that favoured SCU care with regard to a decrease in agitated behaviour and in the use of physical restraints. A convincing case for the benefits of SCU care cannot be made and further studies are necessary.

AB: Abstract - Background Trifluoperazine is a long‐established high potency typical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Objectives To determine absolute effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared with placebo. To critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the resource use, cost and economic evaluation of trifluoperazine compared with placebo for schizophrenia. Search methods Searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (July 2012), supplemented with handsearching, reference searching, personal communication and contact with industry. Two review authors undertook a search for economic studies using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on the 9th April 2013. Selection criteria All available clinical randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses that compare trifluoperazine with placebo. Data collection and analysis Studies for the effects of interventions were reliably selected by a review team and data were doubly independently extracted to reduce bias. We only used dichotomous data, using intention‐to‐treat analysis when possible. Data were estimated using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A 'Summary of findings' table was produced, where possible, for each primary outcome using GRADE. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by review authors (VF and SS) to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already‐included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary. Main results This review included 10 studies with a total number of 686 participants featuring in 20 different outcomes of interest. Overall, there was significant clinical improvement in clinical global state at medium term amongst people receiving trifluoperazine (3 RCTs, n = 417, RR 4.61, CI 1.54 to 13.84,  low quality evidence ) and significantly fewer people receiving trifluoperazine left the studies early due to relapse or worsening at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 381, RR 0.34, CI 0.23 to 0.49,  low quality evidence ). However, results were equivocal for leaving the study early at medium term for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 0.80, CI 0.17 to 3.81,  very low quality evidence ) and due to severe adverse effects (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 1.54, CI 0.56 to 4.24,  very low quality evidence ). Equivocal data were also found for intensified symptoms at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 80, RR 1.05, CI 0.54 to 2.05,  very low quality evidence ) and rates of agitation or distress again at medium term (1 RCT, n = 52, RR 2.00, CI 0.19 to 20.72,  very low quality evidence ). Comparison between low and high‐dose trifluoperazine with placebo from a single study provided equivocal evidence of effects. For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes in GBP terms and presented them in additional tables; there was an estimated saving of £3488.3 in favour of trifluoperazine. However, numerous assumptions were made and these savings need to be interpreted in light of those assumptions. Authors' conclusions Our results agree with existing evidence that compared to placebo, trifluoperazine is an effective antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. Furthermore, our review provides supportive evidence that trifluoperazine increases the risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Although the effect sizes against placebo are similar to those observed with other agents, they are based on data from many small, pre‐CONSORT trials with generally either a  low  or  very low GRADE evidence  that has limited implication for clinical practice. Large, independent trials are needed that adhere to the CONSORT statement to compare trifluoperazine with placebo used in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Plain language summary Trifluoperazine versus placebo for schizophrenia Trifluoperazine (trade name Stelazine) is a long‐established antipsychotic drug that has been used since the 1950s to treat schizophrenia. It is one of the first generation (typical) drugs that have proven very effective for treating the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. These drugs may cause side effects such as involuntary shaking, restlessness and movement disorders such as having a strange posture. There are also more modern drugs (second generation and atypical antipsychotic drugs). These are effective with the ‘positive symptoms’ of mental illness but also help treat ‘negative symptoms’ such as apathy, weight gain and loss of emotion in people with schizophrenia. These more modern drugs are much more expensive. This review is based on a search for trials carried out in July 2012, and includes 10 studies with 686 participants. The aim was to determine the effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia when compared with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment). As expected, people given trifluoperazine showed a significant improvement compared to placebo in both the short and medium term, reinforcing the use of this well‐established typical antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. However, trifluoperazine can cause side effects such as confusion, agitation, having a dry mouth and blurred vision, but causes less sedation and dizzy spells, so is generally well tolerated by people with schizophrenia. The authors of the review conclude that trifluoperazine has similar effectiveness to other common antipsychotic drugs, although it may cause more side effects. Evidence used in the review was also graded as low or very low quality. In the light of this, use of other antipsychotic drugs should be considered before starting on trifluoperazine. Most of the included studies were conducted roughly 40 years ago so new, large, comprehensive and independent research trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between the various first‐generation antipsychotics, however, low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs are sometimes perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency first‐generation compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. Objectives To review the effects of high‐potency, first‐generation perphenazine compared with low‐potency, first‐generation antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (October 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perphenazine with first‐generation, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis and using a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes four relevant randomised trials with 365 participants. The size of the included studies was between 42 and 158 participants with a study length between one and four months. Overall, the methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. Most studies were rated as low risk of bias in terms of blinding. Overall, attrition bias in the studies was high. The effects of perphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotic drugs seemed to be similar in terms of the primary outcome – response to treatment (perphenazine 58%, low‐potency antipsychotics 59%, 2 RCTs, n = 138, RR 0.97 CI 0.74 to 1.26 –  moderate quality of evidence ). There was also no clear evidence of a difference in acceptability of treatment with the number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason, however results were imprecise (perphenazine 30%, low‐potency antipsychotics 28%, 3 RCTs, n = 323, RR 0.78 CI 0.35 to 1.76,  very low quality of evidence ). There were low numbers of studies available for the outcomes experiencing at least one adverse effect (perphenazine 33%, low‐potency antipsychotics 47%, 2 RCTs, n = 165, RR 0.83 CI 0.36 to 1.95,  low quality evidence ) and experiencing at least one movement disorder (perphenazine 22%, low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics 0%, 1 RCT, n = 69, RR 15.62 CI 0.94 to 260.49,  low quality evidence ), and the confidence intervals for the estimated effects did not exclude important differences. Akathisia was more frequent in the perphenazine group (perphenazine 25%, low‐potency antipsychotics 22%, 2 RCTs, n = 227, RR 9.45 CI 1.69 to 52.88), whereas severe toxicity was less so (perphenazine 42%, low‐potency antipsychotics 69%, 1 RCT, n = 96, RR 0.61 CI 0.41 to 0.89). There were three deaths in the low‐potency group by four months but the difference between groups was not significant (perphenazine 0%, low‐potency antipsychotics 2%, 1 RCT, n = 96, RR 0.14 CI 0.01 to 2.69,  moderate quality evidence ). No data were available for our prespecified outcomes of interest sedation or quality of life. Data were not available for other outcomes such as relapse, service use, costs and satisfaction with care. The event rates reported quote simple aggregates and are not based on the RRs. Authors' conclusions The results do not show a superiority in efficacy of high‐potency perphenazine compared with low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics. There is some evidence that perphenazine is more likely to cause akathisia and less likely to cause severe toxicity, but most adverse effect results were equivocal. The number of studies as well as the quality of studies is low, with quality of evidence for the main outcomes ranging from moderate to very low, so more randomised evidence would be needed for conclusions to be made. Plain language summary Perphenazine versus low‐potency first‐generation drugs for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness where people experience ‘positive symptoms’ (such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs) and ‘negative symptoms’ (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia and can be grouped into older drugs (‘typical’ or first‐generation) and newer drugs (‘atypical’ or second‐generation), and within these groups you can have low strength (low‐potency) or high strength (high‐potency) antipsychotics. Perphenazine is a high‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic. Low‐potency antipsychotics are often seen by psychiatrists and health professionals as less effective in treating schizophrenia than high‐potency antipsychotic drugs; they also differ in side effects. Low‐potency antipsychotic drugs often cause sleepiness and low blood pressure whereas high‐potency antipsychotic drugs often produce movement disorders such as restlessness, shaking and tremors. Typical examples of low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine or levomepromazine. The review aims to compare a high‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic, perphenazine with low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics. A search for trials was run in 2010. Four trials that randomised a total of 365 people are included. The studies compared perphenazine with chlorpromazine, thioridazine and levomepromazine. Overall, the trials were of poor quality, poorly reported and small scale. Review authors also rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes to range from moderate to very low quality. It was found that perphenazine was not obviously clinically superior to low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs but was more likely cause the movement disorder akathisia (inner restlessness and the inability to sit still). Low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics are thought more likely to cause side effects such as sedation and hypotension but evidence from this review showed people taking perphenazine were just as likely to experience hypotension as those taking first‐generation antipsychotics and no data were available for sedation. Other outcomes, such as re‐hospitalisation, costs, healthy days and quality of life were not addressed in the studies. No firm conclusions can be made about perphenazine's superiority or inferiority over low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics until newer and better conducted studies are completed.

AB: Abstract - Background In many parts of the world, particularly in industrialised countries, second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs have become first line treatment for people suffering from schizophrenia. The question as to whether the effects of various second generation antipsychotic drugs differ is a matter of debate. Objectives To evaluate the effects of zotepine compared with other second generation antipsychotic drugs for people suffering from schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2009), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical controlled trials that compared zotepine with any forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole or ziprasidone in people suffering from only schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis SS and KK extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (MD) again based on a random‐effects model. Main results We included three studies (total n=289; 2 RCTs zotepine vs clozapine; 1 RCT zotepine vs clozapine vs risperidone (at 4 mg, 8 mg doses) vs remoxipride. All studies were of limited methodological quality. When zotepine was compared with clozapine, it was clozapine that was found to be more effective in terms of global state (n=59, 1 RCT, RR No clinically significant response 8.23 CI 1.14 to 59.17). Mental state scores also favoured clozapine (n=59, 1 RCT, MD average score (BPRS total, high = poor) 6.00 CI 2.17 to 9.83) and there was less use of antiparkinson medication in the clozapine group (n=116, 2 RCTs, RR 20.96 CI 2.89 to 151.90). In the comparison of zotepine and risperidone, mental state scoring found no significant difference between the groups (vs 4 mg: n=40, 1 RCT, MD average endpoint score (BPRS total, high=poor) 1.40 CI ‐9.82 to 12.62; vs 8 mg: n=40, 1 RCT, MD ‐1.30 CI ‐12.95 to 10.35) and use of antiparkinson medication was equivocal (vs 4 mg: n=40, 1 RCT, MD 1.80 CI ‐0.64 to 4.24; vs 8 mg: n=40, 1 RCT, MD 2.50 CI ‐0.05 to 5.05). Finally, when zotepine was compared with remoxipride, again no effect was found for mental state (n=58, 1 RCT, MD average endpoint score (BPRS total, high=poor) 5.70 CI ‐4.13 to 15.53) and there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of use of antiparkinson medication (n=49, 1 RCT, RR 0.97 CI 0.41 to 2.29). Data on important other outcomes such as other adverse events, service use or satisfaction with care, quality of life were not available. Authors' conclusions The evidence base around zotepine is insufficient to provide firm conclusions on its absolute or relative effects. This is despite it being in use in Austria, France, Germany, Japan and the UK. Plain language summary Zotepine versus other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia This review compares the effects of zotepine to other second generation antipsychotic drugs. Three trials suggest that the efficacy of zotepine may be comparable to risperidone and remoxipride. The evidence base is insufficient to provide firm conclusions as to whether zotepine is as effective or less effective than clozapine. The movement disorders and the cognitive changes appear to be similar to clozapine, risperidone and remoxipride. The need for antiparkinson medication is similar to risperidone and remoxipride, but may be associated with increased need than necessary with clozapine.

AB: Abstract - Background Proponents of early intervention have argued that outcomes might be improved if more therapeutic efforts were focused on the early stages of schizophrenia or on people with prodromal symptoms. Early intervention in schizophrenia has two elements that are distinct from standard care: early detection, and phase‐specific treatment (phase‐specific treatment is a psychological, social or physical treatment developed, or modified, specifically for use with people at an early stage of the illness). Early detection and phase‐specific treatment may both be offered as supplements to standard care, or may be provided through a specialised early intervention team. Early intervention is now well established as a therapeutic approach in America, Europe and Australasia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of: (a) early detection; (b) phase‐specific treatments; and (c) specialised early intervention teams in the treatment of people with prodromal symptoms or first‐episode psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2009), inspected reference lists of all identified trials and reviews and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed to prevent progression to psychosis in people showing prodromal symptoms, or to improve outcome for people with first‐episode psychosis. Eligible interventions, alone and in combination, included: early detection, phase‐specific treatments, and care from specialised early intervention teams. We accepted cluster‐randomised trials but excluded non‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention‐to‐treat analysis (ITT). Main results Studies were diverse, mostly small, undertaken by pioneering researchers and with many methodological limitations (18 RCTs, total n=1808). Mostly, meta‐analyses were inappropriate. For the six studies addressing prevention of psychosis for people with prodromal symptoms, olanzapine seemed of little benefit (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.2), and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) equally so (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.50 CI 0.2 to 1.7). A risperidone plus CBT plus specialised team did have benefit over specialist team alone at six months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 2 to 20), but this was not seen by 12 months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR 0.54 CI 0.2 to 1.3). Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA) had advantage over placebo (n=76, 1 RCT, RR transition to psychosis 0.13 CI 0.02 to 1.0, NNT 6 CI 5 to 96). We know of no replications of this finding. The remaining trials aimed to improve outcome in first‐episode psychosis. Phase‐specific CBT for suicidality seemed to have little effect, but the single study was small (n=56, 1 RCT, RR suicide 0.81 CI 0.05 to 12.26). Family therapy plus a specialised team in the Netherlands did not clearly affect relapse (n=76, RR 1.05 CI 0.4 to 3.0), but without the specialised team in China it may (n=83, 1 RCT, RR admitted to hospital 0.28 CI 0.1 to 0.6, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6). The largest and highest quality study compared specialised team with standard care. Leaving the study early was reduced (n=547, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.4 to 0.8, NNT 9 CI 6 to 18) and compliance with treatment improved (n=507, RR stopped treatment 0.20 CI 0.1 to 0.4, NNT 9 CI 8 to 12). The mean number of days spent in hospital at one year were not significantly different (n=507, WMD, ‐1.39 CI ‐2.8 to 0.1), neither were data for 'Not hospitalised' by five years (n=547, RR 1.05 CI 0.90 to 1.2). There were no significant differences in numbers 'not living independently' by one year (n=507, RR 0.55 CI 0.3 to 1.2). At five years significantly fewer participants in the treatment group were 'not living independently' (n=547, RR 0.42 CI 0.21 to 0.8, NNT 19 CI 14 to 62). When phase‐specific treatment (CBT) was compared with befriending no significant differences emerged in the number of participants being hospitalised over the 12 months (n=62, 1 RCT, RR 1.08 CI 0.59 to 1.99). Phase‐specific treatment E‐EPA oils suggested no benefit (n=80, 1 RCT, RR no response 0.90 CI 0.6 to 1.4) as did phase‐specific treatment brief intervention (n=106, 1 RCT, RR admission 0.86 CI 0.4 to 1.7). Phase‐specific ACE found no benefit but participants given vocational intervention were more likely to be employed (n=41, 1 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.21 to 0.7, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). Phase‐specific cannabis and psychosis therapy did not show benefit (n=47, RR cannabis use 1.30 CI 0.8 to 2.2) and crisis assessment did not reduce hospitalisation (n=98, RR 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.3). Weight was unaffected by early behavioural intervention. Authors' conclusions There is emerging, but as yet inconclusive evidence, to suggest that people in the prodrome of psychosis can be helped by some interventions. There is some support for specialised early intervention services, but further trials would be desirable, and there is a question of whether gains are maintained. There is some support for phase‐specific treatment focused on employment and family therapy, but again, this needs replicating with larger and longer trials. Plain language summary Early Intervention for psychosis Schizophrenia typically begins in young adulthood and may lead to disability that lasts a lifetime. The onset of psychosis is usually preceded by a period of non‐psychotic symptoms, known as prodromal symptoms. The symptoms of full‐blown schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking and emotional withdrawal. There is some evidence that a delay in receiving adequate treatment reduces the chances or the extent of recovery. In broad terms, early intervention has two objectives: the first is to prevent the onset of schizophrenia in people with prodromal symptoms; the second is to provide effective treatment to people in the early stages of schizophrenia, with the goal of reducing the ultimate severity of the illness. Early intervention services are now widespread in America, Europe and Australia. We sought to review all trials that involved early intervention for people with prodromal symptoms, or a first episode of psychosis. We identified 18 studies, most were underpowered and at present we have insufficient data to draw any definitive conclusions, although further trials are expected.

AB: Abstract - Background The teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work‐related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational‐level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work‐related stress in teachers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and controlled before‐and‐after studies of organisational‐level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster‐randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped‐wedge design. Changing task characteristics One study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task‐based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from ‐3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low‐quality evidence). Changing organisational characteristics Two studies compared teacher training combined with school‐wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job‐related anxiety (MD ‐0.25 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.11, very low‐quality evidence) or depression (MD ‐0.26 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.05, very low‐quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD ‐0.05 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.42, low‐quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.33, low‐quality evidence) after six months. Multi‐component intervention One study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi‐component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched‐comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow‐up, very low‐quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias. Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex‐interventions framework, use a cluster‐randomised design and have large sample sizes. Plain language summary Work changes to prevent and decrease stress in teachers Background Teachers often experience stress at work, which can lead to physical and mental health problems, increased sickness absence, teacher resignations, and decline in children's performance and health. Individual stress management and counselling programmes directed at teachers only target stress symptoms, while interventions directed at the school organisation target the causes of stress. We searched for studies until January 2015 to assess the evidence on work changes to improve wellbeing and reduce work‐related stress in teachers. Study Characteristics We found four studies that included a total of 2199 teachers. They evaluated three types of work changes. One intervention consisted of changes in teachers' tasks such as redesigning work, establishing flexible work schedules and redesigning the work environment. Another intervention consisted of a school‐wide coaching support network alongside individual training for teachers, in order to deliver a child development programme. The third intervention consisted of several components: performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. Results Changes in tasks of teachers In one study with 961 teachers in eight schools, changes in tasks of teachers combined with stress management training resulted in a small reduction in work stress levels after one year follow‐up compared to no intervention. There was also a small increase in work ability, meaning how well a worker is able to perform his or her work. However, the authors did not report how they changed teachers' tasks, limiting the results' usefulness elsewhere. Changing organisational features There were two studies of school‐wide coaching support combined with teacher training. In one study with 43 schools and 59 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on anxiety or depression after two years follow‐up compared to no intervention. In the other study with 18 schools and 77 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on burnout or emotional ability after six months follow‐up compared to no intervention. Burnout is a state of prolonged severe stress. Emotional ability means understanding other people’s emotions, and understanding and controlling ones own emotions. Both studies had a small number of participants. Multicomponent programme In one study with 34 schools and 1102 teachers, the intervention included performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. After three years follow‐up and compared to 300 similar schools, there was a moderate reduction in resignation of teachers in the intervention schools. However, authors reported results only for eight schools. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low for all interventions because the authors did not report all the results and lost many participants for follow‐up. All included studies also had interventions directed at individual teachers combined with changes at schools. Therefore, new and better quality studies directed at schools will probably change the conclusions of this review. Conclusion Changing the way teachers' work is organised at schools may improve the teachers' wellbeing and may reduce teacher resignations. We need better‐designed research in the development and testing of work changes in schools. In future studies, whether work at schools is changed or not should be determined according to chance. These studies should also have several hundred participants.

AB: Abstract - Background Morita therapy, first proposed in 1919, is a systematic psychological therapy for anxiety disorders that is based on eastern philosophy. It is mainly used as an alternative therapy for anxiety disorders in Asian countries such as Japan and China. Varying foci of treatment outcomes have been reported. To date, there has been no systematic review to investigate the strength of evidence for Morita therapy in anxiety disorders. Objectives To assess the effects of Morita therapy compared with pharmacological therapy, other psychological therapy, no intervention or wait list for anxiety disorders in adults. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date)), Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) and four main Chinese medical databases (Chongqing VIP Database, Wanfang Database, China Hospital Knowledge Database, China Biology Medicine disc) as described in the protocol of this review to December 2014. Furthermore, we extended our search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the Sagace, a web‐based search engine for biomedical databases in Japan. We applied no date or language restrictions. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials comparing Morita therapy with any other treatment in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated fixed‐effect standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CI. Main results We found seven small Chinese studies (449 participants), six of which provided useable data for meta‐analysis. No study compared Morita therapy with an inactive control. Unclear randomisation methods, lack of blinding and low quality reporting of outcomes were common in the included studies. We graded the overall risk of bias as high and the quality of the evidence as very low. Two social phobia studies (75 outpatients) directly compared Morita therapy with pharmacological therapy. In this comparison, the pooled RR of global state was 1.85 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.69) and the NNTB was 3 (95% CI 2 to 5), indicating a significant difference between groups favouring Morita therapy in the short term (up to 12 weeks' post‐treatment). Data regarding drop‐outs was insufficient and no description of adverse effects was provided. We graded the quality of the evidence for this comparison as very low, mainly due to high risk of bias in the studies and insufficient information in the results. Four studies (288 inpatients) investigated the effect of Morita therapy plus pharmacological therapy versus pharmacological therapy alone, three studies for the treatment of obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD) (228 participants) and one study for generalised anxiety disorder (60 participants). One of the OCD studies reported incomplete data of global state while the outcome of global state was missing in the other three studies. There was no significant difference between groups for drop‐outs for any reason in two OCD studies in the short term (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 6.67; I 2  = 44%). Information pertaining to drop‐outs for adverse effects was unclear. We rated the risk of bias of this comparison as high. We graded the quality of the evidence as very low. Authors' conclusions The evidence base on Morita therapy for anxiety disorders was limited. All studies included in this review were conducted in China, and the results may not be applicable to Western countries. These included studies were small, provided insufficient information about drop‐outs and adverse effects, and contained considerable risk of bias. Therefore, we graded the evidence as very low quality and were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of Morita therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Well‐designed future studies that employ adequate allocation concealment, recruit large sample sizes, report drop‐outs and adverse effects, and report outcomes clearly and consistently are needed to establish the effectiveness of Morita therapy for anxiety disorders. Plain language summary Morita therapy for anxiety disorders in adults Background Anxiety disorders are some of the most prevalent mental disorders. Morita therapy, a systematic psychological therapy based on eastern philosophy, has been used to treat anxiety disorders for decades. It encourages people with anxiety disorders to accept anxiety as a natural feeling, while at the same time it engages them in constructive behaviours via four phases, which sequentially are bed rest in isolation, light work, heavy work and preparation for normal daily living. Acceptance is merely redirecting attention towards purposeful behaviour. People get better when they stop trying to eliminate anxiety and fulfil their desires with study and work in their actual personal and social lives. The efficacy of Morita therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders has been a much‐contested issue, often dividing opinion. To date, a systematic review (a review addressing a clearly worded question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant research) investigating the strength of evidence for Morita therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders has not been conducted. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared Morita therapy with treatments with medicines or other psychological therapies (e.g. talking therapies), no treatment or wait list control (where people are waiting to receive a treatment) of adults with anxiety disorders. The evidence was current to December 2014. Key results and quality of evidence We found seven small Chinese studies with 449 participants to include in the review. Six of the seven studies provided useable data for us to analyse; they assessed Morita therapy for generalised anxiety disorder (a long‐term illness that causes people to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues; one study), social phobia (a persistent fear about social situations and being around people; two studies) and obsessive‐compulsive disorder (where a person has obsessive thoughts and repetitive behaviours; three studies). However, these studies were small, imprecise and contained considerable risks of bias, so we were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of Morita therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The review highlighted the need for high‐quality studies to assess the efficacy of Morita therapy on anxiety disorders.

AB: Abstract - Background Quetiapine is a widely used atypical antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia that has been on the market for over a decade. However, It is not clear how the effects of quetiapine differ from typical antipsychotics. Objectives To review the effects of quetiapine in comparison with typical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2010), and inspected references of all identified studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised control trials comparing oral quetiapine with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random‐effects model. We presented chosen outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table and comparative risks where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results The review includes 43 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 7217 participants. Most studies were from China. The percentages of participants leaving the studies early were similar (36.5% in quetiapine group and 36.9% in typical antipsychotics group) and no significant difference between groups was apparent for leaving early due to any reason (23 RCTs n = 3576 RR 0.91 CI 0.81 to 1.01,  moderate quality evidence),  however, fewer participants in the quetiapine group left the studies early due to adverse events (15 RCTs, n = 3010, RR 0.48 CI 0.30 to 0.77). Overall global state was similar between groups (no clinically significant response; 16 RCTs, n = 1607, RR 0.96 CI 0.75 to 1.23,  moderate quality evidence)  and there was no significant difference in positive symptoms (PANSS positive subscore: 22 RCTs, n = 1934, MD 0.02 CI ‐0.39 to 0.43,  moderate quality evidence ). General psychopathology was equivocal (PANSS general psychopathology subscore: 18 RCTs, n = 1569, MD ‐0.20 CI ‐0.83 to 0.42) between those allocated to quetiapine and typical antipsychotics. However, quetiapine was statistically significantly more efficacious for negative symptoms (PANSS negative subscore: 22 RCTs, n = 1934, MD ‐0.82 CI ‐1.59 to ‐0.04,  moderate quality evidence ), however, this result was highly heterogeneous and driven by two small outlier studies with high effect sizes. Without these two studies, there was no heterogeneity and no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and typical antipsychotics. Compared with typical antipsychotics, quetiapine might cause fewer adverse effects (9 RCTs, n = 1985, RR 0.76 CI 0.64 to 0.90 number needed to treat to induce harm (NNTH) 10, CI 8 to 17), less abnormal ECG (2 RCTs, n = 165, RR 0.38 CI 0.16 to 0.92, NNTH 8, CI 4 to 55), fewer overall extrapyramidal effects (8 RCTs, n = 1,095, RR 0.17 CI 0.09 to 0.32, NNTH 3, CI 3 to 3,  moderate quality evidence ) and fewer specific extrapyramidal effects including akathisia, parkinsonism, dystonia and tremor. Moreover, it might cause lower prolactin level (4 RCTs, n = 1034, MD ‐16.20 CI ‐23.34 to ‐9.07,  moderate quality evidence ) and less weight gain compared with some typical antipsychotics in the short term (9 RCTs, n = 866, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, NNTH 8, CI 6 to 15). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in suicide attempt, suicide, death, QTc prolongation, low blood pressure, tachycardia, sedation, gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and white blood cell count. Authors' conclusions Quetiapine may not differ from typical antipsychotics in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology. There are no clear differences in terms of the treatment of negative symptoms. However, it causes fewer adverse effects in terms of abnormal ECG, extrapyramidal effects, abnormal prolactin levels and weight gain. Plain language summary Quetiapine versus typical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, helping to treat both the positive symptoms (such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs) and negative symptoms (including apathy, tiredness and loss of emotion) of this illness. Selecting the most effective antipsychotic drug that can be tolerated by people with schizophrenia is crucial to successful treatment. Older drugs (also known as typical or first generation antipsychotic drugs), such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, have been used in treating schizophrenia for over 50 years. Although these older drugs are good at treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia they tend to cause undesirable side effects. These side effects can mean that people do not tolerate or like taking these drugs, which may lead to relapse and admission to hospital. Since 1988, a newer generation of antipsychotic drugs has become available. These new drugs (known as atypical or second generation antipsychotic drugs) are effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia but thought to have less side effects than older drugs. However, although newer drugs may cause less side effects such as movement disorders, they have been linked to other side effects like heart problems or weight gain. Quetiapine is a new antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia that has been available for over a decade. However, it is not clear how the effects of quetiapine differ from older antipsychotic drugs. This review evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of quetiapine versus older antipsychotic drugs. The review included 43 trials with a total of 7217 people. Most studies were from China. In the main, quetiapine did not differ from older drugs for the treatment of positive symptoms of mental illness. There were also no clear differences in terms of the treatment of negative symptoms. However, it is important to note that evidence from these trials suggests quetiapine causes fewer side effects (such as weight gain, dizziness, movement disorders, the inability to sit still, shaking, tremors and abnormal levels of the hormone prolactin, which can contribute to sexual and mental health problems). However, evidence from the trials is limited due to high numbers of people leaving early in almost all of the studies. More evidence through the completion of well designed studies comparing quetiapine with older antipsychotic drugs is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with ordinary anti‐psychotic drug treatment. In these cases, various add‐on medications are used, among them lithium. Objectives To assess whether:  1. Lithium alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia, schizophrenia‐like psychoses and schizoaffective psychoses; and  2. Lithium augmentation of antipsychotic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses. Search methods In July 2012, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. This search was updated on January 20, 2015. For the first version of the review, we also contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of relevant studies to identify further trials and obtain original participant data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lithium compared with antipsychotics or placebo (or no intervention), whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication, in the treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses or both. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated random‐effects meta‐analyses, risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to create 'Summary of findings' tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results The update search in 2012 detected two further studies that met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any further studies that met our inclusion criteria in the 2015 search. This review now includes 22 studies, with a total of 763 participants (median mean age: 35 years, range: 26 to 72 years). Most studies were small, of short duration, and incompletely reported. As we detected a high risk of bias in many studies, the overall methodological quality of the included sample was rather low. Three small studies comparing lithium with placebo as the sole treatment showed no difference in any of the outcomes we analysed. In eight studies comparing lithium with antipsychotic drugs as the sole treatment, more participants in the lithium group left the studies early (eight RCTs; n = 270, RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.11, low quality evidence). Thirteen studies examined whether the augmentation of antipsychotic drugs with lithium salts is more effective than antipsychotic drugs alone. More participants who received lithium augmentation had a clinically significant response (10 RCTs; n = 396, RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.97, low quality evidence). However, this effect became non‐significant when we excluded participants with schizoaffective disorders in a sensitivity analysis (seven RCTs; n = 272, RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.81), when we excluded non‐double‐blind studies (seven RCTs; n = 224, RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.96), or when we excluded studies with high attrition (nine RCTs; n = 355, RR 1.67, CI 0.93 to 3.00). The overall acceptability of treatment (measured by the number of participants leaving the studies early) was not significantly different between groups (11 RCTs; n = 320, RR 1.89, CI 0.93 to 3.84, very low quality evidence). Few studies reported on side effects. There were no significant differences, but the database is too limited to make any judgement in this regard. For example, there were no data on thyroid dysfunction and kidney problems ‐ two major and well‐known side effects of lithium. Authors' conclusions The evidence base for the use of lithium in schizophrenia is limited to 22 studies of overall low methodological quality. There is no randomised trial‐based evidence that lithium on its own is an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia. There is some GRADE low quality evidence that augmentation of antipsychotics with lithium is effective, but the effects are not significant when more prone‐to‐bias open RCTs are excluded. Nevertheless, further large and well‐designed trials are justified. These should concentrate on two target groups: (1) people with no affective symptoms, so that trialists can determine whether lithium has an effect on the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and (2) people with schizoaffective disorders for whom lithium is widely used in clinical practice, although there is no evidence to support this use. Plain language summary Lithium for schizophrenia Review question To examine whether the drug lithium alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. To look at whether lithium is an effective treatment when added on as an extra treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Background People with schizophrenia often have two main types of symptoms with their illness, the acute symptoms of hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions). Examples of chronic symptoms are low mood/depression, social withdrawal, and memory problems. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, many people with schizophrenia do not respond fully to these drugs, and certain symptoms of the illness can remain when only an antipsychotic is given. In these cases, various add‐on medications are used, among them lithium. Lithium stabilises a person's mood and is used as an add‐on treatment with antipsychotics for schizophrenia. Lithium can reduce mania and depression. Study characteristics The update search in 2012 detected two further studies that met required standards, and no further studies were found in the 2015 search. This review now includes 22 randomised studies, with a total of 763 participants. The studies randomised people with schizophrenia or similar illnesses into groups that received either lithium or placebo (dummy drug), lithium or antipsychotic drugs, lithium plus antipsychotic drugs, or antipsychotic drugs alone. Key results The findings in this review show that there is no good quality evidence that lithium on its own is effective for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. There is some low quality evidence for the effectiveness of lithium as an add‐on treatment with antipsychotic drugs, but this result is inconclusive. Few studies reported on the side effects of lithium (such as kidney and thyroid problems). Quality of the evidence Most of the studies were small, of short duration, and poorly reported. The review authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes to be low or very low quality. Further large and well‐designed trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial treatment that aims to re‐mediate distressing emotional experiences or dysfunctional behaviour by changing the way in which a person interprets and evaluates the experience or cognates on its consequence and meaning. This approach helps to link the person's feelings and patterns of thinking which underpin distress. CBT is now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an add‐on treatment for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This review is also part of a family of Cochrane CBT reviews for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To assess the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy added to standard care compared with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (up to March 6, 2017). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria We selected all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving people diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, which compared adding CBT to standard care with standard care given alone. Outcomes of interest included relapse, rehospitalisation, mental state, adverse events, social functioning, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.We included studies fulfilling the predefined inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We complied with the Cochrane recommended standard of conduct for data screening and collection. Where possible, we calculated relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary data and mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval for continuous data. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results This review now includes 60 trials with 5,992 participants, all comparing CBT added to standard care with standard care alone. Results for the main outcomes of interest (all long term) showed no clear difference between CBT and standard care for relapse (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00; participants = 1538; studies = 13, low‐quality evidence). Two trials reported global state improvement. More participants in the CBT groups showed clinically important improvement in global state (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.84; participants = 82; studies = 2 , very low‐quality evidence). Five trials reported mental state improvement. No differences in mental state improvement were observed (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.02; participants = 501; studies = 5, very low‐quality evidence). In terms of safety, adding CBT to standard care may reduce the risk of having an adverse event (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.72; participants = 146; studies = 2, very low‐quality evidence) but appears to have no effect on long‐term social functioning (MD 0.56, 95% CI ‐2.64 to 3.76; participants = 295; studies = 2, very low‐quality evidence, nor on long‐term quality of life (MD ‐3.60, 95% CI ‐11.32 to 4.12; participants = 71; study = 1, very low‐quality evidence). It also has no effect on long‐term satisfaction with treatment (measured as 'leaving the study early') (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.12; participants = 1945; studies = 19, moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Relative to standard care alone, adding CBT to standard care appears to have no effect on long‐term risk of relapse. A very small proportion of the available evidence indicated CBT plus standard care may improve long term global state and may reduce the risk of adverse events. Whether adding CBT to standard care leads to clinically important improvement in patients' long‐term mental state, quality of life, and social function remains unclear. Satisfaction with care (measured as number of people leaving the study early) was no higher for participants receiving CBT compared to participants receiving standard care. It should be noted that although much research has been carried out in this area, the quality of evidence available is poor ‐ mostly low or very low quality and we still cannot make firm conclusions until more high quality data are available. Plain language summary Is Cognitive behavioural therapy as effective as standard care for people with schizophrenia Background People with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can experience severe disturbances in their thought processes, which may lead to delusions (beliefs that are not based on reality) and hallucinations (seeing and hearing things that are not really there). The mainstay (provides most support for the condition) treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, but these medications are not always successful on their own and additional treatments such as psychosocial therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) are recommended for people with schizophrenia. CBT aims to help people re‐evaluate their views of their symptoms. This process is thought to help reduce distress and change behaviours. It is often used to help people with illnesses such as anxiety and depression. However, CBT is expensive and the evidence for its effectiveness is not clear, particularly for people with schizophrenia. Searches The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched the specialised register for trials that allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either CBT or standard care (the care the participant would normally receive for their condition, in the area the trial was conducted), up to March 2017. These searches found 1730 records. The review authors inspected and screened these records. Main results After screening search results we were able to include 60 trials with 5992 participants. These studies randomly allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either CBT as an add‐on treatment to their standard care or standard care alone. The quality of evidence for our main outcomes of interest was mainly very low, or at best, low. Results showed that adding CBT to standard care did not appear to affect the long‐term risk of relapse. Only two trials (82 participants) provided useful data for long‐term global state; these data showed CBT could be better for long‐term improvement in global state than standard care alone. Adding CBT to standard care may reduce the risk of adverse events but appears to have no advantage over standard care for improving long‐term mental state. Whether adding CBT to standard care improves patient quality of life or social function also remains unclear. Conclusions Currently, the evidence available is unclear and not robust enough to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of adding CBT to standard care for people with schizophrenia compared to standard care alone.

AB: Abstract - Background Infant massage is increasingly being used in the community with babies and their primary caregivers. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for sleep, respiration and elimination, the reduction of colic and wind, and improved growth. Infant massage is also thought to reduce infant stress and promote positive parent‐infant interaction. Objectives The aim of this review was to assess whether infant massage is effective in promoting infant physical and mental health in low‐risk, population samples. Search methods Relevant studies were identified by searching the following electronic databases up to June 2011: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Maternity and Infant Care; LILACS; WorldCat (dissertations); ClinicalTrials.gov; China Masters' Theses; China Academic Journals; China Doctoral Dissertations; China Proceedings of Conference. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. Selection criteria We included studies that randomised healthy parent‐infant dyads (where the infant was under the age of six months) to an infant massage group or a 'no‐treatment' control group. Studies had to have used a standardised outcome measure of infant mental or physical development. Data collection and analysis Mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. Where appropriate, the results have been combined in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Main results We included 34 studies, which includes one that was a follow‐up study and 20 that were rated as being at high risk of bias. We conducted 14 meta‐analyses assessing physical outcomes post‐intervention. Nine meta‐analyses showed significant findings favouring the intervention group for weight (MD ‐965.25 g; 95% CI ‐1360.52 to ‐569.98), length (MD ‐1.30 cm; 95% CI ‐1.60 to ‐1.00), head circumference (MD ‐0.81 cm; 95% CI ‐1.18 to ‐0.45), arm circumference (MD ‐0.47 cm; 95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.13), leg circumference (MD ‐0.31 cm; 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.13), 24‐hour sleep duration (MD ‐0.91 hr; 95% CI ‐1.51 to ‐0.30), time spent crying/fussing (MD ‐0.36; 95% CI ‐0.52 to ‐0.19), deceased levels of blood bilirubin (MD ‐38.11 mmol/L; 95% CI ‐50.61 to ‐25.61), and there were fewer cases of diarrhoea, RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.76). Non‐significant results were obtained for cortisol levels, mean increase in duration of night sleep, mean increase in 24‐hour sleep and for number of cases of upper respiratory tract disease and anaemia. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for weight, length and head circumference, and only the finding for length remained significant following removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias. These three outcomes were the only ones that could also be meta‐analysed at follow‐up; although both weight and head circumference continued to be significant at 6‐month follow‐up, these findings were obtained from studies conducted in Eastern countries only. No sensitivity analyses were possible. We conducted 18 meta‐analyses measuring aspects of mental health and development. A significant effect favouring the intervention group was found for gross motor skills (SMD ‐0.44; 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.18), fine motor skills (SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.35), personal and social behaviour (SMD ‐0.90; 95% CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.18) and psychomotor development (SMD ‐0.35; 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.15); although the first three findings were obtained from only two studies, one of which was rated as being at high risk of bias, and the finding for psychomotor development was not maintained following following removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias in a sensitivity analysis. No significant differences were found for a range of aspects of infant temperament, parent‐infant interaction and mental development. Only parent‐infant interaction could be meta‐analysed at follow‐up, and the result was again not significant. Authors' conclusions These findings do not currently support the use of infant massage with low‐risk groups of parents and infants. Available evidence is of poor quality, and many studies do not address the biological plausibility of the outcomes being measured, or the mechanisms by which change might be achieved. Future research should focus on the impact of infant massage in higher‐risk groups (for example, demographically and socially deprived parent‐infant dyads), where there may be more potential for change. Plain language summary Massage for promoting mental and physical health in infants under the age of six months This review aimed to assess the impact of infant massage on mental and physical outcomes for healthy mother‐infant dyads in the first six months of life. A total of 34 randomised trials were included. Twenty of these had significant problems with their design and the way they were carried out. This means that the we are not as confident as we would otherwise be that the findings are valid. That is to say, the findings of these 20 included studies may over‐ or under‐estimate the true effect of massage therapy.  We combined the data for 14 outcomes measured physical health and 18 outcomes measured aspects of mental health or development. The results show limited statistically significant benefits for a number of aspects of physical health (for example, weight, length, head/arm/leg circumference, 24‐hour sleep duration; time spent crying or fussing; blood bilirubin and number of episodes of illness) and mental health/development (for example, fine/gross motor skills personal and social behaviour and psychomotor development). However, all significant results were lost either at later follow‐up points or when we removed the large number of studies regarded to be at high risk of bias. These findings do not currently support the use of infant massage with low‐risk population groups of parents and infants. The results obtained from this review may be due to the poor quality of many of the included studies, the failure to address the mechanisms by which infant massage could have an impact on the outcomes being assessed, and the inclusion of inappropriate outcomes for population groups (such as weight gain). Future research should focus on the benefits of infant massage for higher‐risk population groups (for example, socially deprived parent‐infant dyads), the duration of massage programmes, and could address differences between babies being massaged by parents or healthcare professionals.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between any other antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Objectives To review the effects in response to treatment of trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (November 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing trifluoperazine with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported.    Trifluoperazine was not significantly different from low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low‐potency drug 27%, 3 RCTs, n = 120, RR 0.96 CI 0.59 to 1.56,  moderate quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (trifluoperazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 16%, 3 RCTs, n = 239, RR 1.25, CI 0.72 to 2.17, low quality evidence ). There was no significant difference in numbers with at least one adverse effect (trifluoperazine 60%, low‐potency antipsychotics 38%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.60, CI 0.94 to 2.74,  moderate quality evidence ). However, at least one movement disorder was significantly more frequent in the trifluoperazine group (trifluoperazine 23%, low‐potency antipsychotics 13%, 2 RCTs, n = 123, RR 2.08 CI 0.78 to 5.55,  very low quality evidence ) as well as incoordination (trifluoperazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 5%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 7.00, CI 1.60 to 30.66) and rigor (trifluoperazine 45%, low‐potency antipsychotics 10%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 4.50, CI 1.58 to 12.84). No data were available for other outcomes of interest death, sedation and quality of life. Authors' conclusions The results did not show a difference in efficacy between trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Trifluoperazine produced more movement disorders. The number of randomised studies as well as their quality is low, the quality of evidence for outcomes of interest ranged from moderate to very low quality, so more, newer studies would be needed for conclusions about the relative effects of trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Trifluoperazine versus low‐potency first‐generation drugs for schizophrenia Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high‐potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side‐effects. The classification into high‐potency and low‐potency medication means that low‐potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side‐effects that are common to most high‐potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low‐potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high‐potency drugs with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high‐potency antipsychotic) with low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low‐potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine. The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people. It compared trifluoperazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality. Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things. They differ slightly in their side‐effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low‐potency antipsychotics was found. Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution.

Main results The review currently includes seven randomised trials and 1567 participants that compared fluphenazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 40 and 438 participants. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported. Fluphenazine was not significantly different from low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (fluphenazine 55%, low‐potency drug 55%, 2 RCTs, n = 105, RR 1.06 CI 0.75 to 1.50,  moderate quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal numbers of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (fluphenazine 36%, low‐potency antipsychotics 36%, 6 RCTs, n = 1532, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.14,  moderate quality evidence ). There was no significant difference between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for numbers experiencing at least one adverse effect (fluphenazine 70%, low‐potency antipsychotics 88%, 1 RCT, n = 65, RR 0.79 CI 0.58 to 1.07,  moderate quality evidence ). However, at least one movement disorder occurred significantly more frequently in the fluphenazine group (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 10%, 3 RCTs, n = 971, RR 2.11 CI 1.41 to 3.15,  low quality of evidence ). In contrast, low‐potency antipsychotics produced significantly more sedation (fluphenazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 64%, 1 RCT, n = 65, RR 0.31 CI 0.13 to 0.77,  high quality evidence ). No data were available for the outcomes of death and quality of life. The results of the primary outcome were robust in a number of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Adverse effects such as  akathisia  (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 6%, 5 RCTs, n = 1209, RR 2.28 CI 1.58 to 3.28);  dystonia  (fluphenazine 5%, low‐potency antipsychotics 2%, 4 RCTs, n = 1309, RR 2.66 CI 1.25 to 5.64);  loss of associated movement  (fluphenazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 2%, 1 RCT, n = 338, RR 11.15 CI 3.95 to 31.47);  rigor  (fluphenazine 27%, low‐potency antipsychotics 12%, 2 RCTs, n = 403, RR 2.18 CI 1.20 to 3.97); and  tremor  (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 6%, 2 RCTs, n = 403, RR 2.53 CI 1.37 to 4.68) occurred significantly more frequently in the fluphenazine group. For other adverse effects such as  dizziness  (fluphenazine 8%, low‐potency antipsychotics 17%, 4 RCTs, n = 1051, RR 0.49 CI 0.32 to 0.73);  drowsiness  (fluphenazine 18%, low‐potency antipsychotics 25%, 3 RCTs, n = 986, RR 0.67 CI 0.53 to 0.86);  dry mouth  (fluphenazine 11%, low‐potency antipsychotics 18%, 4 RCTs, n = 1051, RR 0.63 CI 0.45 to 0.89);  nausea  (fluphenazine 4%, low‐potency antipsychotics 15%, 3 RCTs, n = 986, RR 0.25 CI 0.14 to 0.45); and  vomiting  (fluphenazine 3%, low‐potency antipsychotics 8%, 3 RCTs, n = 986, RR 0.36 CI 0.18 to 0.72) results favoured fluphenazine with significantly more events occurring in the low‐potency antipsychotic group for these outcomes. Authors' conclusions The results do not show a clear difference in efficacy between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. The number of included studies was low and their quality moderate. Therefore, further studies would be needed to draw firm conclusions about the relative effects of fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Fluphenazine versus low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). It is a serious, often long lasting, mental illness that can have a severe detrimental effect on all aspects of the sufferer's life. Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia. Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic that is effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, most antipsychotics have side effects and when compared to newer antipsychotic drugs, fluphenazine is thought to be more likely to cause serious movement disorders such as involuntary shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness and the inability to sit still. Fluphenazine is also known to lower people’s mood. Prescribing low‐strength or low‐potency drugs can help reduce side effects but are often seen as less effective in treating symptoms. This review examined the effects of the high‐potency antipsychotic fluphenazine compared with those of low‐potency antipsychotics. A search for randomised trials comparing these types of drugs was carried out in 2010. The review includes seven studies with 1567 participants. Pooled data from two of these trials did not show a clear difference in effectiveness between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. However, evidence showed fluphenazine produced more movement disorders than low‐potency antipsychotics, whereas the low‐potency drugs were more likely to cause dizziness, drowsiness and sedation, a dry mouth, nausea and sometimes even vomiting. The number of included studies was low and the quality of evidence provided was moderate. Therefore, further good quality studies would be needed to draw firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of fluphenazine compared to low‐potency antipsychotics. Important information on service use, going into hospital again (rehospitalisation), costs and quality of life was missing and not reported. This plain language summary was written by a consumer Ben Gray from RETHINK mental illness.

AB: Abstract - Background It is estimated that up to 75% of cancer survivors may experience cognitive impairment as a result of cancer treatment and given the increasing size of the cancer survivor population, the number of affected people is set to rise considerably in coming years. There is a need, therefore, to identify effective, non‐pharmacological interventions for maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment among people with a previous cancer diagnosis. Objectives To evaluate the cognitive effects, non‐cognitive effects, duration and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions among cancer patients targeted at maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment as a result of cancer or receipt of systemic cancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy or hormonal therapies in isolation or combination with other treatments). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PUBMED, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO databases. We also searched registries of ongoing trials and grey literature including theses, dissertations and conference proceedings. Searches were conducted for articles published from 1980 to 29 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non‐pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive functioning among survivors of adult‐onset cancers who have completed systemic cancer therapy (in isolation or combination with other treatments) were eligible. Studies among individuals continuing to receive hormonal therapy were included. We excluded interventions targeted at cancer survivors with central nervous system (CNS) tumours or metastases, non‐melanoma skin cancer or those who had received cranial radiation or, were from nursing or care home settings. Language restrictions were not applied. Data collection and analysis Author pairs independently screened, selected, extracted data and rated the risk of bias of studies. We were unable to conduct planned meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity in the type of interventions and outcomes, with the exception of compensatory strategy training interventions for which we pooled data for mental and physical well‐being outcomes. We report a narrative synthesis of intervention effectiveness for other outcomes. Main results Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review. Two trials of computer‐assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed‐ and immediate‐ memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well‐being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed‐, immediate‐ and verbal‐memory, self‐reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta‐analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well‐being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.59 to 0.83; I 2 = 67%) or two months post‐intervention (SMD ‐ 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.89 to 0.47; I 2  = 63%) or on mental well‐being two months post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐1.10 to 0.34; I 2  = 67%). Lower mental well‐being immediately post‐intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait‐list controls (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.16; I 2  = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be  low quality  and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear. Authors' conclusions Overall, the, albeit l ow‐quality evidence  may be interpreted to suggest that non‐pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment. Larger, multi‐site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach. There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment among cancer patient groups other than women with breast cancer. Plain language summary Interventions for cognitive impairment due to non‐localised cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy The issue An increasing number of people are surviving and living longer with cancer due to earlier diagnosis, better treatments and an aging population. In turn, there is an increasing number of people with long‐term or long‐lasting effects of cancer and its treatment. For example, up to seven in 10 cancer survivors experience changes in ability regarding memory, learning new things, concentrating, planning and making decisions about their everyday life, as a result of cancer treatment. This is known as cognitive impairment and has a significant impact on the daily activities of cancer survivors. These changes may be caused by non‐localised, systemic cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and is often called 'chemo‐fog' or 'chemobrain'. The aim of the review We reviewed studies that have tested interventions intended to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive function among people who have been treated with systemic cancer treatments. What are the main findings? We identified five eligible studies that described six interventions. These included two studies of computerised cognitive skills practice, two cognitive coping skills training programmes, one meditation intervention and one exercise intervention. All five studies included a total of 235 women who had been treated for breast cancer. The findings suggest that cognitive skills practice and cognitive coping skills training may be useful in improving patient reports and formal assessments of cognition, as well as quality of life. There was insufficient evidence to know if meditation and exercise interventions had any effect on cognition. What is the quality of the evidence? The quality of the evidence was low. There were problems with study designs and, so, we need to be cautious about our conclusions. What are the conclusions? There is not enough good quality evidence to know if any interventions improve cognitive impairment or maintain cognitive functioning among people who have received systemic treatment for cancer. There are several ongoing trials in the field, which may provide the necessary evidence in the future.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries, second‐generation ('atypical') antipsychotic drugs have become the first‐line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. It is not clear how the effects of the various second‐generation antipsychotic drugs differ. Objectives To evaluate the effects of quetiapine compared with other second‐generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2010), inspected references of all identified studies, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral quetiapine with other oral forms of atypical antipsychotic medication in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. We calculated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results Efficacy data tended to favour the control drugs over quetiapine (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score vs olanzapine: 11 RCTs, n = 1486, mean quetiapine endpoint score 3.67 higher, CI 1.95 to 5.39,  low quality ; vs risperidone: 13 RCTs, n = 2155, mean quetiapine endpoint score 1.74 higher, CI 0.19 to 3.29,  moderate quality ; vs paliperidone: 1 RCT, n = 319, mean quetiapine endpoint score 6.30 higher, CI 2.77 to 9.83,  moderate quality ), but the clinical meaning of these data is unclear. No clear mental state differences were noted when quetiapine was compared with clozapine, aripiprazole or ziprasidone. Compared with olanzapine, quetiapine produced slightly fewer movement disorders (7 RCTs, n = 1127, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.51, CI 0.32 to 0.81,  moderate quality ) and less weight gain (8 RCTs, n = 1667, RR 0.68, CI 0.51 to 0.92,  moderate quality ) and glucose elevation, but increased QTc prolongation (3 RCTs, n = 643, MD 4.81, CI 0.34 to 9.28). Compared with risperidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer movement disorders (8 RCTs, n = 2163, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.5, CI 0.36 to 0.69,  moderate quality ), less prolactin increase (7 RCTs, n = 1733, MD ‐35.25, CI ‐43.59 to ‐26.91) and some related adverse effects but greater cholesterol increase (6 RCTs, n = 1473, MD 8.57, CI 4.85 to 12.29). On the basis of limited data, compared with paliperidone, quetiapine induced fewer parkinsonian side effects (1 RCT, n = 319, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.64, CI 0.45 to 0.91,  moderate quality ) and less prolactin increase (1 RCT, n = 319, MD ‐49.30, CI ‐57.80 to ‐40.80) and weight gain (1 RCT, n = 319, RR weight gain of 7% or more of total body weight 2.52, CI 0.5 to 12.78,  moderate quality ). Compared with ziprasidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 522, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.43, CI 0.2 to 0.93,  moderate quality ) and less prolactin increase. On the other hand, quetiapine was more sedating and led to greater weight gain (2 RCTs, n = 754, RR 2.22, CI 1.35 to 3.63,  moderate quality ) and cholesterol increase when compared with ziprasidone. Authors' conclusions Available evidence from trials suggests that most people who start quetiapine stop taking it within a few weeks (around 60%). Comparisons with amisulpride, sertindole and zotepine do not exist. Although efficacy data favour olanzapine and risperidone compared with quetiapine, the clinical meaning of these data remains unclear. Quetiapine may produce fewer parkinsonian effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine. Quetiapine appears to have a similar weight gain profile to risperidone, as well as clozapine and aripiprazole (although data are very limited for the latter two comparators). Quetiapine may produce greater weight gain than ziprasidone and less weight gain than olanzapine and paliperidone. Most data that have been reported within existing comparisons are of very limited value because of assumptions and biases within them. Much scope is available for further research into the effects of this widely used drug. Plain language summary Quetiapine versus other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia Quetiapine is a second‐generation antipsychotic. Second‐generation or atypical antipsychotic drugs have become the mainstay of treatment in many countries for people with schizophrenia. They are called  second‐generation drugs  because they are newer than the older drugs, known as  typical antipsychotics . Second‐generation drugs are thought to be better than the older drugs in reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices and seeing things, and are suggested to produce fewer side effects, such as sleepiness, weight gain, tremors and shaking. However, it is not clear how the various second‐ generation antipsychotic drugs differ from one other. The aim of this review therefore was to evaluate the effects of quetiapine compared with other second‐generation antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia. The review included a total of 35 studies with 5971 people, which provided information on six comparisons (quetiapine vs the following: clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, paliperidone and aripiprazole). Comparisons with amisulpride, sertindole and zotepine do not exist, so more research is needed. A major limitation of all findings was the large number of people leaving studies and stopping quetiapine treatment (50.2% of people). The most important finding to note is that if a group is started on quetiapine, most will be off this drug within a few weeks (although the reasons for stopping quetiapine treatment are not covered by the review and so remain uncertain). Quetiapine may be slightly less effective than risperidone and olanzapine in reducing symptoms, and it may cause less weight gain and fewer side effects and associated problems (such as heart problems and diabetes) than olanzapine and paliperidone, but more than are seen with risperidone and ziprasidone. The limited information tends to suggest that people taking quetiapine may need to be hospitalised more frequently than those taking risperidone or olanzapine. This may lead to higher costs in some settings, but the information is not robust enough to guide managers.

AB: Abstract - Background Haloperidol is worldwide one of the most frequently used antipsychotic drugs with a very high market share. Previous narrative, unsystematic reviews found no differences in terms of efficacy between the various first‐generation (“conventional”, "typical") antipsychotic agents. This established the unproven psychopharmacological assumption of a comparable efficacy between the first‐generation antipsychotic compounds codified in textbooks and treatment guidelines. Because this assumption contrasts with the clinical impression, a high‐quality systematic review appeared highly necessary. Objectives To compare the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of haloperidol with other first‐generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods In October 2011 and July 2012, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. To identify further relevant publications, we screened the references of all included studies and contacted the manufacturers of haloperidol for further relevant trials and missing information on identified studies. Furthermore, we contacted the corresponding authors of all included trials for missing data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral haloperidol with another oral first‐generation antipsychotic drug (with the exception of the low‐potency antipsychotics chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, levopromazine, mesoridazine, perazine, prochlorpromazine, and thioridazine) in schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Clinically important response to treatment was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were global state, mental state, behaviour, overall acceptability (measured by the number of participants leaving the study early due to any reason), overall efficacy (attrition due to inefficacy of treatment), overall tolerability (attrition due to adverse events), and specific adverse effects. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration`s 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed dichotomous outcomes with risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes with mean differences (MD), both with the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). All analyses were based on a random‐effects model and we preferably used data on an intention‐to‐treat basis where possible. Main results The systematic review currently includes 63 randomised trials with 3675 participants. Bromperidol (n = 9), loxapine (n = 7), and trifluoperazine (n = 6) were the most frequently administered antipsychotics comparator to haloperidol. The included studies were published between 1962 and 1993, were characterised by small sample sizes (mean: 58 participants, range from 18 to 206) and the predefined outcomes were often incompletely reported. All results for the main outcomes were based on  very low or low quality  data. In many trials the mechanism of randomisation, allocation, and blinding was frequently not reported. In short‐term studies (up to 12 weeks), there was no clear evidence of a difference between haloperidol and the pooled group of the other first‐generation antipsychotic agents in terms of the primary outcome "clinically important response to treatment" (40 RCTs, n = 2132, RR 0.93 CI 0.87 to 1.00). In the medium‐term trials, haloperidol may be less effective than the other first‐generation antipsychotic group but this evidence is based on only one trial (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.51 CI 0.37 to 0.69). Based on limited evidence, haloperidol alleviated more positive symptoms of schizophrenia than the other antipsychotic drugs. There were no statistically significant between‐group differences in global state, other mental state outcomes, behaviour, leaving the study early due to any reason, due to inefficacy, as well as due to adverse effects. The only statistically significant difference in specific side effects was that haloperidol produced less akathisia in the medium term. Authors' conclusions The findings of the meta‐analytic calculations support the statements of previous narrative, unsystematic reviews suggesting comparable efficacy of first‐generation antipsychotics. In efficacy‐related outcomes, there was no clear evidence of a difference between the prototypal drug haloperidol and other, mainly high‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics. Additionally, we demonstrated that haloperidol is characterised by a similar risk profile compared to the other first‐generation antipsychotic compounds. The only statistically significant difference in specific side effects was that haloperidol produced less akathisia in the medium term. The results were limited by the low methodological quality in many of the included original studies. Data for the main results were  low or very low quality . Therefore, future clinical trials with high methodological quality are required. Plain language summary Haloperidol versus first‐generation antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia Haloperidol is one of the most frequently used antipsychotic drugs worldwide. It is a first‐generation antipsychotic drug. Haloperidol is highly effective in treating the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, haloperidol also has serious side effects such as involuntary shaking, blurred vision, having a dry mouth and causing strange postures. Psychiatrists and people with schizophrenia often face a trade‐off between protection against mental illness and coping with these severe side effects. Previous small studies and unsystematic reviews have found no difference between the various first‐ generation antipsychotic drugs. This has led to the assumption that these drugs are similar in effectiveness (despite observations by psychiatrists and health professionals that these drugs do sometimes differ in their effectiveness and side effects). Because of high prescription‐rates, research on haloperidol is very important. A search for randomised trials was run in 2012. This review includes 63 trials with 3675 participants. Haloperidol was compared with a large number of other first‐generation antipsychotic drugs (including bromperidol, loxapine and trifluoperazine) to assess its effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability. The findings of the review support the evidence of previous small, narrative studies and unsystematic reviews. There was no difference between haloperidol and other mainly high‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs. In addition, haloperidol was characterised by a similar risk profile and side effects to other first‐generation antipsychotic drugs. People receiving haloperidol were less likely to experience akathisia in the medium term. Occurrence of other specific side effect such as tremor, dystonia, dyskinesia and rigor were all similar between treatment groups. Psychiatrists and people with schizophrenia should know that haloperidol and other first‐generation antipsychotic drugs are similar in their effectiveness and risk of side effects. These drugs should also be similar in their acceptability for people with schizophrenia. However, results were limited due to the low quality of many of the included studies and low quality of evidence provided. Future studies of higher quality are required.

AB: Abstract - Background Intensive Case Management (ICM) is a community‐based package of care aiming to provide long‐term care for severely mentally ill people who do not require immediate admission. Intensive Case Management evolved from two original community models of care, Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Case Management (CM), where ICM emphasises the importance of small caseload (fewer than 20) and high‐intensity input. Objectives To assess the effects of ICM as a means of caring for severely mentally ill people in the community in comparison with non‐ICM (caseload greater than 20) and with standard community care. We did not distinguish between models of ICM. In addition, to assess whether the effect of ICM on hospitalisation (mean number of days per month in hospital) is influenced by the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and by the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted (baseline level of hospital use). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (last update search 10 April 2015). Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, aged 18 to 65 years and treated in the community care setting, where ICM is compared to non‐ICM or standard care. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We performed a random‐effects meta‐regression analysis to examine the association of the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted with the treatment effect. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach and investigated possible risk of bias within included trials. Main results The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies. The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non‐ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. 1. ICM versus standard care When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.34, low‐quality evidence ). Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79,  low‐quality evidence ). For the outcome adverse events, the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51,  low‐quality evidence ). In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low‐quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0,  very low‐quality evidence ). 2. ICM versus non‐ICM When ICM was compared with non‐ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate‐quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.21,  moderate‐quality evidence ) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.05,  moderate‐quality evidence ) compared to non‐ICM. Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, low‐quality evidence ) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84,  low‐quality evidence ). Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non‐ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74,  very low‐quality evidence ). 3. Fidelity to ACT Within the meta‐regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline hospital use' variable coefficient ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.32 to ‐0.10). Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.07, P = 0.0027). Authors' conclusions Based on very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness. Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care. It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illnesses in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years). Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital. However, it is unclear what overall gain ICM provides on top of a less formal non‐ICM approach. We do not think that more trials comparing current ICM with standard care or non‐ICM are justified, however we currently know of no review comparing non‐ICM with standard care, and this should be undertaken. Plain language summary Intensive case management for people with severe mental illness Background Severe mental illnesses are defined by diagnosis, degree of disability and the presence of some abnormal behaviour. Including schizophrenia and psychosis, severe mood problems, and personality disorder, severe mental illness can cause considerable distress over a long period of time to both the person affected and his or her family and friends.  Until the 1970s, it was common for those suffering from these disorders to remain in an institution for most of their lives, but in most of the countries of the world, they are now managed in the community with one of several different types of intervention. Intensive Case Management (ICM) is one such intervention. It consists of management of the mental health problem and the rehabilitation and social support needs of the person concerned, over an indefinite period of time, by a team of people who have a fairly small group of clients (fewer than 20). Twenty‐four‐hour help is offered and clients are seen in a non‐clinical setting.    Aims of the review To find and present good‐quality evidence concerning the effectiveness of ICM compared with non‐ICM (where people receive the same package of care, but the professionals have caseloads of more than 20 people) and standard care (where people are seen as outpatients, but their support needs are less clearly defined) for people with severe mental illness.  Searching for evidence We carried out electronic searches for randomised controlled trials comparing ICM with non‐ICM or standard care in 2009, 2012, and 2015. Results We included 40 trials involving 7524 people. The trials took place in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and the USA. When ICM was compared to standard care, those in the ICM group were more likely to stay with the service, have improved general functioning, get a job, not be homeless, and have shorter stays in hospital (especially when they had had very long stays in hospital previously). When ICM was compared to non‐ICM, the only clear difference was that those in the ICM group were more likely to be kept in care.  Conclusions None of the evidence for the main outcomes of interest was high quality; at best the evidence was of moderate quality. In addition, the healthcare and social support systems of the countries where the studies took place were quite different, so it was difficult to make valid overall conclusions. Furthermore, we were unable to use much of the data on quality of life and patient and carer satisfaction because the trials used many different scales to measure these outcomes, some of which were not validated.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second generation ('atypical') antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various new generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics. Objectives To evaluate the effects of ziprasidone compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised Register (April 2007) and references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. This search was updated July 2012, 254 citations added to awaiting classification section. Selection criteria We included all randomised, at least single‐blind, controlled trials comparing oral ziprasidone with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (MD) for dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. Main results The review currently includes nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 3361 participants. The overall rate of premature study discontinuation was very high (59.1%). Data for the comparisons of ziprasidone with amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone were available. Ziprasidone was a less acceptable treatment than olanzapine (leaving the studies early for any reason: 5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 1.26 CI 1.18 to 1.35, NNH 7 CI 5 to 10) and risperidone (3 RCTs, n=1029, RR 1.11 CI 1.02 to 1.20, NNH 14 CI 8 to 50), but not than the other second generation antipsychotic drugs. Ziprasidone was less efficacious than amisulpride (leaving the study early due to inefficacy: 1 RCT, n=123, RR 4.72 CI 1.06 to 20.98, NNH 8 CI 5 to 50) olanzapine (PANSS total score: 4 RCTs, n=1291, MD 8.32 CI 5.64 to 10.99) and risperidone (PANSS total score: 3 RCTs, n=1016, MD 3.91 CI 0.27 to 7.55). Based on limited data there were no significant differences in tolerability between ziprasidone and amisulpride or clozapine. Ziprasidone produced less weight gain than olanzapine (5 RCTs, n=1659, MD ‐3.82 CI ‐4.69 to ‐2.96), quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=754, RR 0.45 CI 0.28 to 0.74) or risperidone (3 RCTs, n=1063, RR 0.49 CI 0.33 to 0.74). It was associated with less cholesterol increase than olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone. Conversely ziprasidone produced slightly more extrapyramidal side‐effects than olanzapine (4 RCTs, n=1732, RR 1.43 CI 1.03 to 1.99, NNH not estimable) and more prolactin increase than quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=754, MD 4.77 CI 1.37 to 8.16), but less movement disorders (2 RCTs, n=822, RR 0.70 CI 0.51 to 0.97, NNT not estimable) and less prolactin increase (2 RCTs, n=767, MD ‐21.97 CI ‐27.34 to ‐16.60) than risperidone. Note: the 254 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Authors' conclusions Ziprasidone may be a slightly less efficacious antipsychotic drug than amisulpride, olanzapine and risperidone. Its main advantage is the low propensity to induce weight gain and associated adverse effects. However, the high overall rate of participants leaving the studies early limits the validity of any findings. Plain language summary Ziprasidone versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia Ziprasidone is one of a group of new 'atypical' antipsychotics used for treating schizophrenia. This review wanted to find out if there was evidence to support that there is any difference between ziprasidone and the other atypical medications. Because of the large number of people that dropped out of the studies it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions, however, people taking ziprasidone did not do as well regarding their symptoms, as those taking olanzapine and risperidone and perhaps amisulpride, but they were less likely to gain weight.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second generation (atypical) antipsychotics have become first line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examine how the efficacy and tolerability of amisulpride differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics. Objectives To evaluate the effects of amisulpride compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We updated this search in July 2012 and added 47 new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria We included randomised, at least single‐blind, trials comparing oral amisulpride with oral forms of aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For continuous data we calculated weighted mean differences (MD), for dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. Main results The review currently includes ten short to medium term trials with 1549 participants on three comparisons: amisulpride versus olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. The overall attrition rate was considerable (34.7%) with no significant difference between groups. Amisulpride was similarly effective as olanzapine and risperidone and more effective than ziprasidone (leaving the study early due to inefficacy: n=123, 1 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.05 to 0.94, NNT 8 CI 5 to 50). Amisulpride induced less weight gain than risperidone (n=585, 3 RCTs, MD ‐0.99 CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.37) or olanzapine (n=671, 3 RCTs, MD ‐2.11 CI ‐2.94 to ‐1.29). Olanzapine was also associated with a higher increase of glucose (n=406, 2 RCTs, MD ‐7.30 CI ‐7.62 to ‐6.99). There was no difference in terms of cardiac effects and extra pyramidal symptoms (EPS) compared with olanzapine (akathisia: n= 587, 2 RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.36 to 1.21), compared with risperidone (akathisia: n=586, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.58 to 1.11) and compared with ziprasidone (akathisia: n=123, 1 RCT, RR 0.63, CI 0.11 to 3.67). Authors' conclusions There is little randomised evidence comparing amisulpride with other second generation antipsychotic drugs. We could only find trials comparing amisulpride with olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. We found amisulpride may be somewhat more effective than ziprasidone, and more tolerable in terms of weight gain and other associated problems than olanzapine and risperidone. These data, however, are based on only ten short to medium term studies and therefore too limited to allow for firm conclusions. Note: the 47 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Amisulpride versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review compared the effects of amisulpride with those of other so called second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs. For half of the possible comparisons not a single relevant study could be identified. Based on very limited data there was no difference in efficacy comparing amisulpride with olanzapine and risperidone, but a certain advantage compared with ziprasidone. Amisulpride was associated with less weight gain than risperidone and olanzapine.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often clinically perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds, and they also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Objectives To review the effects in clinical response of haloperidol and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing haloperidol with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 17 randomised trials and 877 participants. The size of the included studies was between 16 and 109 participants. All studies were short‐term with a study length between two and 12 weeks. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported. We found no clear evidence that haloperidol was superior to low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of clinical response (haloperidol 40%, low‐potency drug 36%, 14 RCTs, n = 574, RR 1.11, CI 0.86 to 1.44 low quality evidence ). There was also no clear evidence of benefit for either group in acceptability of treatment with equivocal difference in the number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (haloperidol 13%, low‐potency antipsychotics 17%, 11 RCTs, n = 408, RR 0.82, CI 0.38 to 1.77,  low quality evidence ). Similar equivocal results were found between groups for experiencing at least one adverse effect (haloperidol 70%, low‐potency antipsychotics 35%, 5 RCTs n = 158, RR 1.97, CI 0.69 to 5.66,  very low quality evidence  ). More participants from the low‐potency drug group experienced sedation (haloperidol 14%, low‐potency antipsychotics 41%, 2 RCTs, n = 44, RR 0.30, CI 0.11 to 0.82,  moderate quality evidence ), orthostasis problems (haloperidol 25%, low‐potency antipsychotics 71%, 1 RCT, n = 41, RR 0.35, CI 0.16 to 0.78) and weight gain (haloperidol 5%, low‐potency antipsychotics 29%, 3 RCTs, n = 88, RR 0.22, CI 0.06 to 0.81). In contrast, the outcome 'at least one movement disorder' was more frequent in the haloperidol group (haloperidol 72%, low‐potency antipsychotics 41%, 5 RCTs, n = 170, RR 1.64, CI 1.22 to 2.21,  low quality evidence ). No data were available for death or quality of life. The results of the primary outcome were robust in several subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Authors' conclusions The results do not clearly show a superiority in efficacy of haloperidol compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. Differences in adverse events were found for movement disorders, which were more frequent in the haloperidol group, and orthostatic problems, sedation and weight gain, which were more frequent in the low‐potency antipsychotic group. The quality of studies was low, and the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interest varied from moderate to very low, so more newer studies would be needed in order to draw a definite conclusion about whether or not haloperidol is superior or inferior to low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Haloperidol versus first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia Drugs called antipsychotics are the main treatment for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where sufferers experience both positive symptoms of delusions and hallucinations and negative symptoms such as apathy, lack of drive, disorganisation of behaviour and thought. This review examined whether a high‐potency antipsychotic, haloperidol is more effective than low‐potency antipsychotics. The classification into high‐potency and low‐potency medication means that for low‐potency antipsychotic drugs, higher doses are necessary to obtain the same effect and response in patients. Haloperidol is the most frequently used antipsychotic drug in many countries and, along with other high‐potency antipsychotics is often considered more effective than low‐potency antipsychotics. Typical examples of low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine or levomepromazine. High‐ and low‐potency antipsychotics also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Low‐potency drugs cause sedation and poor muscle strength, whereas high‐potency drugs produce side‐effects such as movement disorders (the inability to sit still, uncontrollable shaking and difficulty in walking). The review is based on results of a search run in 2010 and includes 17 studies with a total of 877 participants comparing haloperidol with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs.The results do not clearly show a superiority of haloperidol compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. However, more participants from the low‐potency drug group experienced weight gain and sedation. The experience of at least one movement disorder was significantly higher with haloperidol. The number as well as the quality of studies is low, for the main outcomes of interest the authors rated quality of evidence for as moderate quality for two of them, two as low quality and one as very low quality. So the evidence is not strong and more newer studies would be needed in order to draw a conclusion about whether or not haloperidol is superior to low‐potency antipsychotics. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that there is moderate quality evidence that haloperidol and low‐potency antipsychotics are approximately equal in their effectiveness, but there is lower quality evidence that they clearly differ in side‐effects (such as weight gain and movement disorders).

AB: Abstract - Background Since the 1950s antipsychotic medication has been extensively used to treat people with chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. These drugs, however, have also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) – a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements around the mouth and face. Various strategies have been examined to reduce a person's cumulative exposure to antipsychotics. These strategies include dose reduction, intermittent dosing strategies such as drug holidays, and antipsychotic cessation. Objectives To determine whether a reduction or cessation of antipsychotic drugs is associated with a reduction in TD for people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) who have existing TD. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the use of specific antipsychotics for similar groups of people could be a treatment for TD that was already established. Search methods We updated previous searches of Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based Register of Trials including the registers of clinical trials (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We also contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports if they assessed people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had established antipsychotic‐induced TD, and had been randomly allocated to (a) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic cessation (placebo or no intervention), (b) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic reduction (including intermittent strategies), (c) specific antipsychotics for the treatment of TD versus placebo or no intervention, and (d) specific antipsychotics versus other antipsychotics or versus any other drugs for the treatment of TD. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who dropped out had no improvement. Main results We included 13 RCTs with 711 participants; eight of these studies were newly included in this 2017 update. One trial is ongoing. There was low‐quality evidence of a clear difference on no clinically important improvement in TD favouring switch to risperidone compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (1 RCT, 42 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.23 to 0.89, low‐quality evidence). Because evidence was of very low quality for antipsychotic dose reduction versus antipsychotic maintenance (2 RCTs, 17 people, RR 0.42 95% CI 0.17 to 1.04, very low‐quality evidence), and for switch to a new antipsychotic versus switch to another new antipsychotic (5 comparisons, 5 RCTs, 140 people, no meta‐analysis, effects for all comparisons equivocal), we are uncertain about these effects. There was low‐quality evidence of a significant difference on extrapyramidal symptoms: use of antiparkinsonism medication favouring switch to quetiapine compared with switch to haloperidol (1 RCT, 45 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.21 to 0.96, low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for switch to risperidone or haloperidol compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (RR 1 RCT, 48 people, RR 2.08 95% CI 0.74 to 5.86, low‐quality evidence) and switch to risperidone compared with switch to haloperidol (RR 1 RCT, 37 people, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35, very low‐quality evidence). Trials also reported on secondary outcomes such as other TD symptom outcomes, other adverse events outcomes, mental state, and leaving the study early, but the quality of the evidence for all these outcomes was very low due mainly to small sample sizes, very wide 95% CIs, and risk of bias. No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, outcomes that we designated as being important to patients. Authors' conclusions Limited data from small studies using antipsychotic reduction or specific antipsychotic drugs as treatments for TD did not provide any convincing evidence of the value of these approaches. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration to fully investigate this area. Plain language summary Antipsychotic‐reduction and/or cessation and antipsychotics as specific treatments for tardive dyskinesia Review question To determine whether stopping or reducing antipsychotic drugs helps in the reduction of tardive dyskinesia for people with schizophrenia. To examine whether specific antipsychotic drugs could be a treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue, and jaw to convulse, spasm, and grimace. It is caused by long‐term use or high doses of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat, and can be incurable. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce a person’s exposure to antipsychotic drugs. These include lowering the dose of medication, intermittent ‘drug holidays’, and stopping taking antipsychotic medication altogether. Study characteristics The review includes 13 trials with a total of 711 people with schizophrenia and other psychiatric diagnoses. Key results Due to the poor quality, small size, and limited data from the 13 studies, there is limited evidence. It is not known if strategies such as dose reduction, ‘drug holidays’, and stopping medication are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. There is limited evidence on specific antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Quality of the evidence Evidence is poor, small scale, and of short duration. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration in order to fully investigate this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is defined as a depressive disorder with a minimum illness duration of two years, including four diagnostic subgroups (dysthymia, chronic major depression, recurrent major depression with incomplete remission between episodes, and double depression). Persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world. Growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments. Yet, given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long‐term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance. To date, there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. Objectives To assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non‐specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU). Continuation treatments are defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment. Maintenance therapy is given during recovery (which is defined as remission lasting longer than six months). Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was also conducted for RCTs via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 Dec 2015). In addition we searched grey literature resources as well as the international trial registers  ClinicalTrials.gov  and  ICTRP  to 28 September 2018. We screened reference lists of included studies and contacted the first author of all included studies. Selection criteria We included randomized (RCTs) and non‐randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data. The primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression. The primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence. We performed random‐effects meta‐analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants in this review, from which five studies investigated continuation treatments and five studies investigated maintenance treatments. Overall, the included studies were at low‐to‐moderate risk of bias. For the three NRCTs, the most common source of risk of bias was selection of reported results. For the seven RCTs, the most common sources of risk of bias was non‐blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). Pharmacological continuation and maintenance therapies The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies). Participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4; I² = 54%, moderate quality evidence). Overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386; I² = 64%, low quality evidence). However, sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. Psychological continuation and maintenance therapies One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non‐specific control. One study compared psychotherapy with medication. The results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication. However, the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Combined psychological and pharmacological continuation and maintenance therapies Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone. One study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone. However, the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions Comparison of different antidepressant medications Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants. However, the body of evidence for this comparison was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Authors' conclusions Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD, due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies. For all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions. Further studies should address health‐related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow‐up data. Plain language summary Long‐term treatment for people with persistent depression Why is this review important? Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems. Even after successful treatment, they frequently recur. Common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both. Long‐term treatments should prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. Who will be interested in this review? ‐ People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers. ‐ General practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists. What questions does this review aim to answer? In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short‐term) treatment: ‐ Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both more effective in preventing recurrence of depression compared to placebo (a pretended treatment) or care as usual? ‐ Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of both equally accepted as receiving placebo or usual care? ‐ Is one treatment more effective or more accepted than another? Which studies does the review include? We searched medical databases and other sources to find all relevant studies completed up to September 2018. The studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of both, with each other, with placebo, or with care as usual for preventing recurrence of depression in adults diagnosed with persistent depression. We included 10 studies involving 840 participants. Five studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo. One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non‐specific control. One study compared psychotherapy with medication. Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone. One study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone. Two studies compared two different antidepressants with each other. Overall, the included studies were at low‐to‐moderate risk of bias. What does the evidence from the review tell us? According to GRADE, there was moderate quality evidence that participants taking medication treatment probably had less relapses/recurrences and may have lower dropouts than those taking placebo. The risk of depression returning in participants receiving a placebo (instead of antidepressant medicine) was 34%. In comparison, participants who remained on antidepressant medicines had a lower risk for recurrence of 13%. The continued treatment lasted between four months and two years. Antidepressant were as well accepted as placebo. However, as most of the included studies showed risk of bias and there were some inconsistent results between the different studies, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) is a convincing treatment for people with PDD. Additionally, as studies on the long‐term effects of medication are lacking, recommendations on the necessary duration of medication treatment cannot be drawn. The benefits of psychological therapies or combined treatment remained unclear, due to the small number of studies. What should happen next? This review cannot provide clear, certain evidence regarding whether continued antidepressant medication (compared to placebo tablet) reduces the risk of depression recurring in adults with persistent depression. However, only a few studies have been done. Further studies should especially address psychological and combined long‐term treatments.

AB: Abstract - Background Fluvoxamine, one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. Several studies have previously reviewed the efficacy and tolerability of fluvoxamine for the treatment of major depression. However, these reviews are now outdated. Objectives Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability and side effect profile of fluvoxamine for major depression in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents, including tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs, SNRIs, other newer agents and other conventional psychotropic drugs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register. Trial databases and ongoing trial registers in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia, were handsearched for randomised controlled trials. We checked reference lists of the articles included in the review, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of affective disorder for published reports and citations of unpublished research. The date of last search was 31 August 2008. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials, published in any language, that compared fluvoxamine with any other active antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors inspected citations and abstracts, obtained papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). A random effects model was used to combine studies. Main results A total of 54 randomised controlled trials (n = 5122) were included. No strong evidence was found to indicate that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to other antidepressants regarding response, remission and tolerability. However, differing side effect profiles were evident, especially with regard to gastrointestinal side effects of fluvoxamine when compared to other antidepressants. For example, fluvoxamine was generally associated with a higher incidence of vomiting/nausea (versus imipramine, OR 2.23, CI 1.59 to 3.14; versus clomipramine, OR 2.13, CI 1.06 to 4.27; versus amitriptyline, OR 2.86, CI 1.31 to 2.63). Authors' conclusions We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, differing side effect profiles were evident. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations, including these differences in side effect profiles. Plain language summary Fluvoxamine versus other anti‐depressive agents for depression Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay for treatment of moderate or severe depression. Fluvoxamine is one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. This review reports trials comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for treatment of major depression. We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, there is evidence of differing side‐effect profiles, especially when comparing gastrointestinal side effects between fluvoxamine and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including these differences in side effect profiles.

AB: Abstract - Background The symptoms and signs of schizophrenia have been firmly linked to high levels of dopamine in specific areas of the brain (limbic system). Antipsychotic drugs block the transmission of dopamine in the brain and reduce the acute symptoms of the disorder. This review examined whether antipsychotic drugs are also effective for relapse prevention. Objectives To review the effects of maintaining antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia compared to withdrawing these agents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Specialised Register (November 2008), with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov (June 2011). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs and placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 65 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 6493 participants comparing antipsychotic medication with placebo. The trials were published from 1959 to 2011 and their size ranged between 14 and 420 participants. In many studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. Although this and other potential sources of bias limited the overall quality, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia was clear. Antipsychotic drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at seven to 12 months (primary outcome; drug 27%, placebo 64%, 24 RCTs, n=2669, RR 0.40 CI 0.33 to 0.49, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB 3 CI 2 to 3). Hospitalisation was also reduced, however, the baseline risk was lower (drug 10%, placebo 26%, 16 RCTs, n=2090, RR 0.38 CI 0.27 to 0.55, NNT 5 CI 4 to 9). More participants in the placebo group than in the antipsychotic drug group left the studies early due to any reason (at 7‐12 months: drug 38%, placebo 66%, 18 RCTs, n=2420, RR 0.55 CI 0.46 to 0.66, NNTB 4 CI 3 to 5) and due to inefficacy of treatment (at 7‐12 months: drug 20%, placebo 50%, 18 RCTs, n=2420, RR 0.36 CI 0.28 to 0.45, NNTB 3 CI 2 to 4). Quality of life was better in drug‐treated participants (3 RCTs, n=527, SMD ‐0.62 CI ‐1.15 to ‐0.09). Conversely, antipsychotic drugs as a group and irrespective of duration, were associated with more participants experiencing movement disorders (e.g. at least one movement disorder: drug 16%, placebo 9%, 22 RCTs, n=3411, RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNTH 25 CI 13 to 100), sedation (drug 13%, placebo 9%, 10 RCTs, n=146, RR 1.50 CI 1.22 to 1.84, number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) not significant) and weight gain (drug 10%, placebo 6%, 10 RCTs, n=321, RR 2.07 CI 1.31 to 3.25, NNTH 20 CI 14 to 33). The results of the primary outcome were robust in a number of subgroup, meta‐regression and sensitivity analyses, the main exception being that the drug‐placebo difference in longer trials was smaller than in shorter trials. Authors' conclusions The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo in preventing relapse. This effect must be weighed against the side effects of antipsychotic drugs. Future studies should focus on outcomes of social participation and clarify the long‐term morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs. Plain language summary Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia. The current report presents the first systematic review comparing the effects of all antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo for maintenance treatment, that is relapse prevention after the acute phase. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) since the 1950s have consistently shown that antipsychotic drugs effectively reduce relapses and need for hospitalisation. Conversely, they are, as a group, associated with a number of side effects such as movement disorders, weight gain and sedation.

AB: Abstract - Background Fluphenazine is one of the first drugs to be classed as an 'antipsychotic' and has been widely available for five decades. Objectives To compare the effects of oral fluphenazine with placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. To evaluate any available economic studies and value outcome data. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (23 July 2013, 23 December 2014, 9 November 2016 and 28 December 2017 ) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We sought all randomised controlled trials comparing oral fluphenazine with placebo relevant to people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were global state and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis For the effects of interventions, a review team inspected citations and abstracts independently, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed trials. We extracted data independently. Dichotomous data were analysed using fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were excluded if more than 50% of people were lost to follow‐up, but, where possible, mean differences (MD) were calculated. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by an economic review team to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already‐included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary. Main results From over 1200 electronic records of 415 studies identified by our initial search and this updated search, we excluded 48 potentially relevant studies and included seven trials published between 1964 and 1999 that randomised 439 (mostly adult participants). No new included trials were identified for this review update. Compared with placebo, global state outcomes of 'not improved or worsened' were not significantly different in the medium term in one small study (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 1.12 CI 0.79 to 1.58,  very low quality of evidence ). The risk of relapse in the long term was greater in two small studies in people receiving placebo (n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.05 to 3.31,  very low quality of evidence ), however with high degree of heterogeneity in the results. Only one person allocated fluphenazine was reported in the same small study to have died on long‐term follow‐up (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 2.38 CI 0.10 to 55.72,  low quality of evidence ). Short‐term extrapyramidal adverse effects were significantly more frequent with fluphenazine compared to placebo in two other studies for the outcomes of akathisia (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.43 CI 1.23 to 9.56,  moderate quality of evidence ) and rigidity (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.54 CI 1.76 to 7.14,  moderate quality of evidence ). For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes for relapse and presented them in additional tables. Authors' conclusions The findings in this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know, but they provide quantification to support clinical impression. Fluphenazine's global position as an effective treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the outcome of this review. However, fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment and if accessible, other inexpensive drugs less associated with adverse effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Fluphenazine versus Placebo for Schizophrenia Review question:  Is sluphenazine effective for the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo? Background Fluphenazine is one of the first drugs to be classed as an 'antipsychotic' and has been widely available for decades. Searching for evidence We updated the electronic search in December 2017 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive oral fluphenazine or placebo. No new studies were found to be added in this update. Evidence found Seven trials met the review requirements and provided useable data.The evidence currently available is of poor quality and suggests that whilst fluphenazine is a potent and effective antipsychotic, it has considerable side effects. Conclusions Antipsychotic drugs are the first line and mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. They help to effectively treat psychotic symptoms such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations) and having strange beliefs (delusions). Fluphenazine was one of the first antipsychotics and has been available for around 50 years. Fluphenazine is inexpensive and in developing countries, may be one of the only drug treatments available. In most of Europe and North America, despite still being available, the arrival of newer antipsychotic drugs has reduced the use of fluphenazine and its market share. Fluphenazine has debilitating side effects, including: dizziness; movement disorders such as involuntary movements or spasms; shaking and tremors; inner restlessness and the inability to sit still; and problems with blood pressure, fever and muscle stiffness. This review included seven studies and compared the effects of fluphenazine taken by mouth with placebo (‘dummy’ treatment).  In the main, the findings of the review support the widespread view that fluphenazine is a potent and effective antipsychotic but has considerable side effects, other antipsychotic drugs may well be preferable. Fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment with serious side effects, so other inexpensive antipsychotic drugs with fewer side effects may be better for people with schizophrenia. Despite this, fluphenazine has a low cost and is widely available, so is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. However, some of fluphenazine's side effects could be expensive in terms of human suffering and personal cost of treatment. Even though fluphenazine has been used as an antipsychotic drug for decades, there are still a surprisingly small number of well‐conducted studies measuring its effectiveness and potential to cause side effects. Future large‐scale research should report on important outcomes such as improvement in mental health, relapse, hospital discharge and admission, levels of satisfaction with treatment and quality of life. This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray from RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background Hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation has been implicated in the development and relapse of psychotic disorders. Elevated cortisol secretion has been positively linked with symptom severity in people with psychosis. Antiglucocorticoid and related drugs that target the HPA axis may be useful for the treatment of individuals with psychosis. Objectives 1. To determine the effects of antiglucocorticoid and related drugs for the treatment of psychosis, when used alone or in combination with antipsychotic medication. 2. To determine whether the effects of these medications differs between those in a prodromal phase or first episode of psychosis, and those with more established illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (August 2009 and April 2014). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiglucocorticoid and related drugs compared to placebo (either as a sole treatment or as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, antidepressants or other combination treatment) for people with a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, or for individuals at high risk of developing a psychotic disorder. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We used a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for continuous measures. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included 11 studies that randomly assigned 509 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. No trials were conducted in patients at their first episode of psychotic illness and none included populations at high risk for developing psychosis. Our pre‐stated outcomes of interest were mental state, global state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life. Two trials compared antiglucocorticoid drugs (mifepristone) versus placebo as sole treatment. Limited data from one trial showed no difference in the proportion responding to mifepristone when mental state was assessed immediately post intervention using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 5, 1 RCT, MD ‐5.20, 95% CI ‐17.91 to 7.51;  very low‐quality evidence ); depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) total) were also similar between groups (n = 5, 1 RCT, MD 1.67, 95% CI ‐16.44 to 19.78;  very low‐quality evidence ). However, a significant difference favoured treatment at short‐term follow‐up for global state (30% reduction in total BPRS, n = 221, 1 RCT, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89;  low‐grade quality evidence ). This effect was also seen for short‐term positive psychotic symptoms (50% reduction in BPRS positive symptom subscale, n = 221, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84;  low‐grade quality evidence ). Participants receiving mifepristone experienced a similar overall number of adverse effects as those receiving placebo (n = 226, 2 RCTs, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09;  moderate‐quality evidence ). No data on general functioning or quality of life were available. One trial compared an antiglucocorticoid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotic treatment to adjunctive placebo. Data for main outcomes of interest were of low quality, and analysis of useable data showed no significant effects of treatment on mental state or adverse effects. Data on global state, general functioning and quality of life were not available. Data from six trials comparing antiglucocorticoid drugs as an adjunct to combination treatment versus adjunctive placebo showed no significant differences between groups in mean endpoint scores for overall psychotic symptoms (n = 171, 6 RCTs, SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐ 0.29 to 0.32) or positive psychotic symptoms (n = 151, 5 RCTs, SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐ 0.40 to 0.25). Data from three trials showed no differences between groups in mean endpoint scores for negative symptoms (n = 94, 3 RCTs, MD 2.21, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 4.55). One study found improvements in global state that were similar between groups (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.06;  very low‐quality evidence ). In this comparison, pooled results showed that antiglucorticoids caused a greater overall number of adverse events (n = 199, 7 RCTs, RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.32;  moderate quality evidence ), but no quality of life data were available. Authors' conclusions Good evidence is insufficient to conclude whether antiglucocorticoid drugs provide effective treatment for psychosis. Some global state findings suggest a favourable effect for mifepristone, and a few overall adverse effect findings favour placebo. Additional large randomised controlled trials are needed to justify findings. Plain language summary Antiglucocorticoid and related treatments for psychosis Psychosis is a broad term that includes several mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic depression and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Psychotic disorders affect about 3% of the population and may cause high levels of disability, making it a significant public health problem both socially and economically. Stress may result in the release of cortisol and has been linked with both onset and relapse of psychotic disorders. Elevated cortisol levels have been found in some people with psychosis, especially among those suffering with psychotic depression and those in earlier phases of psychosis. Antiglucocorticoid drugs have been reported to reduce the effects of cortisol and may be useful for people with psychotic depression and bipolar disorder. We reviewed all randomised trials comparing antiglucocorticoid and related drugs versus placebo in people with psychosis ‐ prodromal psychosis or first episode of psychosis. Eleven studies (involving 509 participants) were included in this review. Several antiglucocorticoid‐related drugs were examined, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (n = 5), mifepristone (n = 4), dexamethasone (n = 1) and ketoconazole (n = 1). All participants were adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Most trials examined giving antiglucocorticoid drugs as an additional part of regular treatment. Available data from these trials revealed no effects for overall psychotic symptoms, 'positive' symptoms or 'negative' symptoms. One large trial comparing mifepristone versus placebo as the sole treatment revealed a significant difference in the proportion of people responding to treatment with mifepristone versus placebo. This effect was not seen immediately but 21 days after the intervention was begun. Adverse effect data varied. When individual anticorticoids such as mifepristone and DHEA were compared with placebo, the incidence of side effects was similar between groups; however, pooled data on various antiglucorticoids given as an adjunct to combination treatment showed that antiglucocorticoids increased incidence of side effects than placebo. In summary, very few trials are under way, and most involve a small number of people. Limited available data do not provide enough evidence to support the use of antiglucocorticoid treatments for psychosis; additional trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background As international healthcare policy has moved away from treating people with severe mental illness in large inpatient psychiatric institutions, beds for people with acute psychiatric disorders are being established in specialised psychiatric units in general hospitals. In developing countries, however, limited resources mean that it is not always possible to provide discrete psychiatric units, either in general hospitals or in the community. An alternative model of admission, used in the Caribbean, is to treat the person with acute psychosis in a general hospital ward. Objectives To compare the outcomes for people with acute psychosis who have been admitted to open medical wards with those admitted to conventional psychiatric units. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register (April 2007). This register is compiled from searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, Sociofile, and many conference proceedings. Selection criteria We would have included all relevant randomised or quasi‐randomised trials, allocating anyone thought to be suffering from an acute psychotic episode to either acute management on general medical wards, or acute management in a specialist psychiatric unit. The primary outcomes of interest were length of stay in hospital and relapse. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we would have calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based using a fixed effects model. Main results We didnt identify any relevant randomised trials. Authors' conclusions The Caribbean practice of treating people with severe mental illness on general medical wards has been influenced by socio‐economic factors rather than evidence from randomised trials. This practice affords an opportunity for a well designed, well conducted and reported randomised trial, now impossible in many other settings. Plain language summary Open general medical wards versus specialist psychiatric units for acute psychoses Psychosis is disturbance of a person’s thinking that causes them to have false perceptions of the senses (hallucinations) and see the world in a different way from the majority (delusions). Psychosis can cause the sufferer to become very distressed. The majority of people who need hospital treatment for psychosis receive it in specialist psychiatric wards. However in some parts of the developing world, especially the Caribbean, a system has grown up where people with psychosis are admitted and treated on general medical wards along with those who have non‐psychiatric conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. They are treated with antipsychotics and are expected to help nurse others as they get better. This review attempted to compare trials randomising treatment in a general medical ward with treatment in a psychiatric ward, however there are no trials which meet the inclusion criteria. Since there is a published article which suggests that people in a general ward recover faster and are more able to return to employment or education afterwards, it would be helpful to do a randomised controlled trial comparing these two treatments to see if this is the case.

AB: Abstract - Background The World Health Organization (WHO) Model Lists of Essential Medicines lists chlorpromazine as one of its five medicines used in psychotic disorders. Objectives To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose side‐effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (December 2008; 2 October 2014; 19 December 2016). Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low doses of chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day), medium dose (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or higher doses (> 800 mg/day) for people with schizophrenia, and which reported clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We included studies meeting review criteria and providing useable data. Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs based on a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and graded trial quality using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results As a result of searches undertaken in 2014, we found one new study and in 2016 more data for already included studies. Five relevant studies with 1132 participants (585 are relevant to this review) are now included. All are hospital‐based trials and, despite over 60 years of chlorpromazine use, have durations of less than six months and all are at least at moderate risk of bias. We found only data on low‐dose (≤ 400 mg/day) versus medium‐dose chlorpromazine (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) and low‐dose versus high‐dose chlorpromazine (> 800 mg/day). When low‐dose chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared to medium‐dose chlorpromazine (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day), there was no clear benefit of one dose over the other for both global and mental state outcomes ( low‐quality  and  very low‐quality evidence ). There was also no clear evidence for people in one dosage group being more likely to leave the study early, over the other dosage group ( moderate‐quality evidence ). Similar numbers of participants from each group experienced agitation and restlessness ( very low‐quality evidence ). However, significantly more people in the medium‐dose group (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) experienced extrapyramidal symptoms in the short term (2 RCTS, n = 108, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74,  moderate‐quality evidence ). No data for death were available. When low‐dose chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared to high‐dose chlorpromazine (> 800 mg/day), data from one study with 416 patients were available. Clear evidence of a benefit of the high dose was found with regards to global state. The low‐dose group had significantly fewer people improving (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25,  moderate‐quality evidence ). There was also a marked difference between the number of people leaving the study from each group for any reason, with significantly more people leaving from the high‐dose group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89,  moderate‐quality evidence ). More people in the low‐dose group had to leave the study due to deterioration in behaviour (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.44,  low‐quality evidence ). There was clear evidence of a greater risk of people experiencing extrapyramidal symptoms in general in the high‐dose group (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.59,  moderate‐quality evidence ). One death was reported in the high‐dose group yet no effect was shown between the two dosage groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14,  moderate‐quality evidence ). No data for mental state were available. Authors' conclusions The dosage of chlorpromazine has changed drastically over the past 50 years with lower doses now being the preferred of choice. However, this change was gradual and arose not due to trial‐based evidence, but due to clinical experience and consensus. Chlorpromazine is one of the most widely used antipsychotic drugs yet appropriate use of lower levels has come about after many years of trial and error with much higher doses. In the absence of high‐grade evaluative studies, clinicians have had no alternative but to learn from experience. However, such an approach can lack scientific rigor and does not allow for proper dissemination of information that would assist clinicians find the optimum treatment dosage for their patients. In the future, data for recently released medication should be available from high‐quality trials and studies to provide optimum treatment to patients in the shortest amount of time. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine dose for people with schizophrenia Review question This review looks at the best dose of chlorpromazine for treating people with schizophrenia. Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting around 1% of the adult population worldwide. People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first antipsychotic drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It still remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. Study characteristics An updated search for relevant randomised controlled trials was run in October 2014, and again, in December 2016 and found one new study. Five studies have now been found that meet the review inclusion criteria. The included studies are all randomised, and investigate the effects of giving different doses of chlorpromazine to people with schizophrenia. The total number of participants was 585. Key results Chlorpromazine showed different effects at varying doses. Based on weak evidence, the effects on people’s mental health at low dosage and medium dosage are much the same. However, there are more side effects at medium dose. There is more improvement in people’s mental health at high dose compared to low dose. However, side effects are much more numerous and debilitating at high dose. In the past fifty years, low dose has been the favoured amount to use with patients. This change has come about gradually and is based on everyday experience and consensus rather than hard scientific evidence. Chlorpromazine is low‐cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark or ‘gold standard’ drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. Quality of the evidence All trials in the review are hospital‐ based and all but one date from 20 years ago. There are a limited number of studies of limited quality and these are poorly reported and short term. Further research and trials on chlorpromazine dose are justified.

AB: Abstract - Background Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand‐searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and a double‐entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. Main results A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an antidepressive agent, quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.62 and OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55). Authors' conclusions Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy. Plain language summary Duloxetine versus other antidepressive agents for depression Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression. During the last 20 years, newer compounds (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual action agents such as serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Duloxetine hydrochloride, one of the most recent antidepressants introduced in the market, is a selective serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor for oral administration. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Sixteen randomised controlled trials (5735 participants) were included. Duloxetine was not more effective than some other new antidepressant agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression, and it was less well tolerated than escitalopram and venlafaxine as more patients allocated to duloxetine withdrew treatment before study end. However, due to the limited number of studies per comparison these results should be interpreted with caution.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia often presents in adolescence, but current treatment guidelines are based largely on studies of adults with psychosis. Over the past decade, the number of studies on treatment of adolescent‐onset psychosis has increased. The current systematic review collates and critiques evidence obtained on the use of various atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis. Objectives To investigate the effects of atypical antipsychotic medications in adolescents with psychosis. We reviewed in separate analyses various comparisons of atypical antipsychotic medications with placebo or a typical antipsychotic medication or another atypical antipsychotic medication or the same atypical antipsychotic medication but at a lower dose. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 2011), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies and contacted study authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies to ask for more information. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo or another pharmacological intervention or with psychosocial interventions, standard psychiatric treatment or no intervention in children and young people aged 13 to 18 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, acute and transient psychoses or unspecified psychosis. We included studies published in English and in other languages that were available in standardised databases. Data collection and analysis Review authors AK and SSD selected the studies, rated the quality of the studies and performed data extraction. For dichotomous data, we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed‐effect model. When possible, for binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' table, we calculated illustrative comparative risks. We summated continuous data using the mean difference (MD). Risk of bias was assessed for included studies. Main results We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 1112 participants. We found no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response. Trials were classified into the following groups. 1. Atypical antipsychotics versus placebo  Only two studies compared one atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo. In one study, the number of non‐responders treated with olanzapine was not different from the number treated with placebo (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10); however, significantly more (57% vs 32%) people left the study early (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87) from the placebo group compared with the olanzapine group. With regard to adverse effects, young people treated with aripiprazole had significantly lower serum cholesterol compared with those given placebo (1 RCT, n = 302, RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.58). 2. Atypical antipsychotics versus typical antipsychotics  When the findings of all five trials comparing atypical antipsychotic medications with a typical antipsychotic medication were collated, no difference in the mean end point Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was noted between the two arms (5 RCTs, n = 236, MD ‐1.08, 95% CI ‐3.08 to 0.93). With regard to adverse effects, the mean end point serum prolactin concentration was much higher than the reference range for treatment with risperidone, olanzapine and molindone in one of the studies. However, fewer adolescents who were receiving atypical antipsychotic medications left the study because of adverse effects (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15) or for any reason (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). 3. One atypical antipsychotic versus another atypical antipsychotic  The mean end point BPRS score was not significantly different for people who received risperidone compared with those who received olanzapine; however, the above data were highly skewed. Overall no difference was noted in the number of people leaving the studies early because of any adverse effects between each study arm in the three studies comparing olanzapine and risperidone (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.04). Specific adverse events were not reported uniformly across the six different studies included in this section of the review; therefore it was difficult to do a head‐to‐head comparison of adverse events for different atypical antipsychotic medications. 4. Lower‐dose atypical antipsychotic versus standard/higher‐dose atypical antipsychotic  Three studies reported comparisons of lower doses of the atypical antipsychotic medication with standard/higher doses of the same medication. One study reported better symptom reduction with a standard dose of risperidone as compared with a low dose (1 RCT, n = 257, RR ‐8.00, 95% CI ‐13.75 to ‐2.25). In another study, no difference was reported in the number of participants not achieving remission between the group receiving 10 mg/d and those who received 30 mg/d of aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 196, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Similarly in the other study, authors reported no statistically significant difference in clinical response between the two groups receiving lower‐dose (80 mg/d) and higher‐dose (160 mg/d) ziprasidone, as reflected by the mean end point BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 17, MD ‐4.40, 95% CI ‐19.20 to 10.40). Authors' conclusions No convincing evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic medications are superior to typical medications for the treatment of adolescents with psychosis. However, atypical antipsychotic medications may be more acceptable to young people because fewer symptomatic adverse effects are seen in the short term. Little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic medication over another, but side effect profiles are different for different medications. Treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is often associated with weight gain. Aripiprazole is not associated with increased prolactin or with dyslipidaemia. Adolescents may respond better to standard‐dose as opposed to lower‐dose risperidone, but for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, lower doses may be equally effective. Future trials should ensure uniform ways of reporting. Plain language summary Atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis Schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses often begin in adolescence, and treatment of adolescents with psychosis usually involves use of antipsychotic drugs. Newer drugs (atypical antipsychotics) are more popular than older ones (typical antipsychotics). However, this determination is based on the generalisation of adult treatment to a younger age group, with evidence from studies on adults generally guiding the treatment of adolescents.  Adolescents may respond differently to medication compared with adults. This review looks at evidence derived from trials in which the participants are adolescents receiving atypical or typical antipsychotics or a placebo (dummy treatment) and/or high or low doses of medication. A total of 13 trials consisting of 1112 people between 13 and 18 years of age are included. Most studies were short‐term trials (completed within 12 weeks). In the main, no convincing evidence shows that newer drugs (atypical antipsychotics) are better than older ones (typical antipsychotics) in terms of their ability to treat the symptoms of psychosis. However, newer drugs may be more acceptable for young people to take because they produce fewer side effects in the short term. Furthermore, very little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic over another atypical antipsychotic. The nature of side effects also differs markedly between medications. For example, treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is associated with weight gain, but aripiprazole is not associated with weight gain. Some evidence indicates that adolescents respond better to standard‐dose as opposed to lower‐dose risperidone. However, for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, a lower dose and a standard dose may be equally effective. Longer, clearer and more detailed research trials that use systematic ways of reporting and comparing the side effects of different antipsychotic drugs are much needed. So too is a research focus on other important outcomes such as hospital admission, service use, costs, behaviour change and possible improvements in people’s thinking. Until such research is completed, very little evidence suggests that newer drugs (atypical antipsychotics) are better than older drugs (typical antipsychotics) for the treatment of adolescents with schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background Vitamins and minerals play multiple functions within the central nervous system which may help to maintain brain health and optimal cognitive functioning. Supplementation of the diet with various vitamins and minerals has been suggested as a means of maintaining cognitive function, or even of preventing dementia, in later life. Objectives To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people aged 40 years or more. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP from inception to 26th January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the cognitive effects on people aged 40 years or more of any vitamin or mineral supplements taken by mouth for at least three months. Data collection and analysis Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were done in duplicate. Vitamins were considered broadly in the categories of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and combinations of both. Minerals were considered separately, where possible. If interventions and outcomes were considered sufficiently similar, then data were pooled. In order to separate short‐term cognitive effects from possible longer‐term effects on the trajectory of cognitive decline, data were pooled for various treatment durations from 3 months to 12 months and up to 10 years or more. Main results In total, we included 28 studies with more than 83,000 participants. There were some general limitations of the evidence. Most participants were enrolled in studies which were not designed primarily to assess cognition. These studies often had no baseline cognitive assessment and used only brief cognitive assessments at follow‐up. Very few studies assessed the incidence of dementia. Most study reports did not mention adverse events or made only very general statements about them. Only 10 studies had a mean follow‐up > 5 years. Only two studies had participants whose mean age was < 60 years at baseline. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low, other than a risk of attrition bias for longer‐term outcomes. We considered the certainty of the evidence behind almost all results to be moderate or low. We included 14 studies with 27,882 participants which compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these to placebo. The majority of participants were aged over 60 years and had a history of cardio‐ or cerebrovascular disease. We found that giving B vitamin supplements to cognitively healthy adults, mainly in their 60s and 70s, probably has little or no effect on global cognitive function at any time point up to 5 years (SMD values from ‐0.03 to 0.06) and may also have no effect at 5‐10 years (SMD ‐0.01). There were very sparse data on adverse effects or on incidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. We included 8 studies with 47,840 participants in which the active intervention was one or more of the antioxidant vitamins: ß‐carotene, vitamin C or vitamin E. Results were mixed. For overall cognitive function, there was low‐certainty evidence of benefit associated with ß‐carotene after a mean of 18 years of treatment (MD 0.18 TICS points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35) and of vitamin C after 5 years to 10 years (MD 0.46 TICS points, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78), but not at earlier time points. From two studies which reported on dementia incidence, there was low‐certainty evidence of no effect of an antioxidant vitamin combination or of vitamin E, either alone or combined with selenium. One of the included studies had been designed to look for effects on the incidence of prostate cancer; it found a statistically significant increase in prostate cancer diagnoses among men taking vitamin E. One trial with 4143 participants compared vitamin D3 (400 IU/day) and calcium supplements to placebo. We found low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence of no effect of vitamin D3 and calcium supplements at any time‐point up to 10 years on overall cognitive function (MD after a mean of 7.8 years ‐0.1 MMSE points, 95% CI ‐0.81 to 0.61) or the incidence of dementia (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24). A pilot study with 60 participants used a higher dose of vitamin D3 (4000 IU on alternate days) and found preliminary evidence that this dose probably has no effect on cognitive function over six months. We included data from one trial of zinc and copper supplementation with 1072 participants. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of little or no effect on overall cognitive function (MD 0.6 MMSE points, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 1.39) or on the incidence of cognitive impairment after 5 years to 10 years. A second smaller trial provided no usable data, but reported no cognitive effects of six months of supplementation with zinc gluconate. From one study with 3711 participants, there was low‐certainty evidence of no effect of approximately five years of selenium supplementation on the incidence of dementia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13). Finally, we included three trials of complex supplements (combinations of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals) with 6306 participants. From the one trial which assessed overall cognitive function, there was low‐certainty evidence of little or no effect on the TICS (MD after a mean of 8.5 years 0.12, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.38). Authors' conclusions We did not find evidence that any vitamin or mineral supplementation strategy for cognitively healthy adults in mid or late life has a meaningful effect on cognitive decline or dementia, although the evidence does not permit definitive conclusions. There were very few data on supplementation starting in midlife (< 60 years); studies designed to assess cognitive outcomes tended to be too short to assess maintenance of cognitive function; longer studies often had other primary outcomes and used cognitive measures which may have lacked sensitivity. The only positive signals of effect came from studies of long‐term supplementation with antioxidant vitamins. These may be the most promising for further research. Plain language summary Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing cognitive deterioration in cognitively healthy people in mid and late life Review question This review aimed to find out whether people aged 40 years or older could maintain their mental abilities or reduce their risk of dementia by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Background There is great interest in anything people might do to keep themselves mentally healthy as they age and, especially, to reduce their risk of developing dementia. Various vitamin and mineral supplements have been suggested as ways to do this. Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the body and the ways they might affect brain health are not well understood. Therefore, we were interested in the effects of any vitamins or minerals, either alone or in combination. What we did We searched up to January 2018 for all trials which had studied the effect on cognition (thinking and remembering) of any vitamin or mineral supplements in people aged 40 years or more who had no cognitive problems at the beginning of the study. The studies had to include a comparison group which had not taken the supplement being studied and, to be sure the comparison was fair, it should have been decided at random whether people got the supplement or not. What we found We grouped the 28 included trials according to the kind of supplement they used and how it might work. Most of the trials were not originally designed to study cognition or dementia and used only simple measures of cognition. Very few studies investigated whether participants developed dementia. Long‐term studies are probably needed to find effects on the risk of dementia or cognitive decline but only 10 studies had an average length of follow‐up longer than five years. The studies were generally well‐conducted although the longer trials had difficulty following up all of the participants and this could have biased some of the longer‐term results. There were 14 trials of B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12) with nearly 28,000 participants, mainly in their 60s and 70s. Most of these trials were quite short (less than two years). We found no evidence that B vitamins had any effect on cognition. There were 8 trials of antioxidant vitamins (beta‐carotene/vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E) with approximately 47,000 participants. These trials tended to be longer than the B vitamin trials so may have had more chance of detecting effects on dementia and cognitive decline. The results were mixed. We found low‐certainty evidence of better overall cognitive function after an average of 18 years taking beta‐carotene and after five years to 10 years taking vitamin C, but no effects after shorter periods of treatment. There were also small benefits of beta‐carotene, vitamin C, and antioxidant combinations on memory at some time points but not others. There was no evidence of any benefits from vitamin E alone. Two studies examined the risk of developing dementia. One found no effect of a combination of antioxidant vitamins and the other found no effect of vitamin E, either alone or combined with the mineral selenium. Most of the studies did not report any information about harmful effects. One included trial was designed to look for an effect on the risk of prostate cancer; it found a higher risk among the men taking vitamin E. There was a small trial of vitamin D supplements which found they probably had no effect on cognition over six months. There were longer trials of vitamin D with calcium (one trial), zinc and copper (one trial), and complex multivitamins (three trials). All lasted between five and 10 years, but none of them found any evidence of beneficial effects on cognition. One trial found no effect of selenium taken for approximately five years on the risk of developing dementia. Conclusions We found no good evidence to suggest that middle‐aged or older people can preserve cognitive function or prevent dementia by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. There were a few positive results associated with long‐term use of antioxidant vitamins, particularly beta‐carotene and vitamin C, although the effects were small. Further research into the effects of these vitamins may be worthwhile.

AB: Abstract - Background Yoga is an ancient body‐mind practice which originated in India and is popular in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine the efficacy of yoga delivered as a package of care versus non‐standard care. Objectives To examine the effects of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care for schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (latest 15 May 2018) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PsychINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga as part of a package of care with non‐standard care. Data collection and analysis There were no data to analyse as no studies met the inclusion criteria. Main results The searches identified 30 studies that could be relevant to this review. After careful inspection, 29 were excluded and one is ongoing. No data were available for analyses. Authors' conclusions In view of the lack of evidence from RCTs, it is currently not possible for us to comment on the use of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care. Plain language summary Yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care Review question Is yoga, delivered as part of a larger package of care, effective for people with schizophrenia compared with non‐standard care? Background Yoga involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise for reduction of stress and promotion of health and feelings of well‐being. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where people experience symptoms such as hearing voices that are not there, poor emotional response and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia often affects people for long periods of their life and is treated primarily by antipsychotic medications. However, these medications are not always fully effective and some research suggests that yoga as an add‐on treatment could be beneficial and help improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga can be combined with other therapies such as counselling or other forms of exercise into a 'package of care'. Non‐standard care can consist of talking therapies, expressive therapies (art, dance, drama, music and writing) and other forms of exercise. Searching for evidence In May 2018, the Information Specialist for Cochrane Schizophrenia searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of randomised controlled trials for trials of people with schizophrenia. Thirty studies were found that could be relevant. The review authors carefully inspected full‐text versions of these studies, checking that they were randomised controlled trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive, in addition to their ongoing care, either yoga as part of a package of care or another type of non‐standard care intervention. Twenty‐nine of these studies did not meet the above inclusion criteria and are excluded from the review. One study is 'ongoing' as data are not available at the moment. Key results Currently, there are no data available from randomised controlled trials regarding the effects of yoga as part of a package of care compared with non‐standard care for people with schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Currenlty, there is no high‐quality evidence to support or discourage the use of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care. Schizophrenia is often a long‐term illness and studies which compare yoga packages to other types of therapies are necessary.

AB: Abstract - Background Somatoform disorders are characterised by chronic, medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). Although different medications are part of treatment routines for people with somatoform disorders in clinics and private practices, there exists no systematic review or meta‐analysis on the efficacy and tolerability of these medications. We aimed to synthesise to improve optimal treatment decisions. Objectives To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for somatoform disorders (specifically somatisation disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, somatoform autonomic dysfunction, and pain disorder) in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 17 January 2014). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from  The Cochrane Library  (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). To identify ongoing trials, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials  meta Register, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry. For grey literature, we searched ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database, OpenGrey, and BIOSIS Previews. We handsearched conference proceedings and reference lists of potentially relevant papers and systematic reviews and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We selected RCTs or cluster RCTs of pharmacological interventions versus placebo, treatment as usual, another medication, or a combination of different medications for somatoform disorders in adults. We included people fulfilling standardised diagnostic criteria for somatisation disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, somatoform autonomic dysfunction, or somatoform pain disorder. Data collection and analysis One review author and one research assistant independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes included the severity of MUPS on a continuous measure, and acceptability of treatment. Main results We included 26 RCTs (33 reports), with 2159 participants, in the review. They examined the efficacy of different types of antidepressants, the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, antipsychotics alone, or natural products (NPs). The duration of the studies ranged between two and 12 weeks. One meta‐analysis of placebo‐controlled studies showed no clear evidence of a significant difference between tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and placebo for the outcome severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.13; 95% CI ‐0.39 to 0.13; 2 studies, 239 participants; I 2  = 2%; low‐quality evidence). For new‐generation antidepressants (NGAs), there was very low‐quality evidence showing they were effective in reducing the severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.91; 95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.46; 3 studies, 243 participants; I 2  = 63%). For NPs there was low‐quality evidence that they were effective in reducing the severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.74; 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.51; 2 studies, 322 participants; I 2  = 0%). One meta‐analysis showed no clear evidence of a difference between TCAs and NGAs for severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.16; 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.23; 3 studies, 177 participants; I 2  = 42%; low‐quality evidence). There was also no difference between NGAs and other NGAs for severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.16; 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.14; 4 studies, 182 participants; I 2  = 0%). Finally, one meta‐analysis comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with a combination of SSRIs and antipsychotics showed low‐quality evidence in favour of combined treatment for severity of MUPS (SMD 0.77; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.22; 2 studies, 107 participants; I 2  = 23%). Differences regarding the acceptability of the treatment (rate of all‐cause drop‐outs) were neither found between NGAs and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.61; 2 studies, 163 participants; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence) or NPs and placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.78; 3 studies, 506 participants; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence); nor between TCAs and other medication (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.72; 8 studies, 556 participants; I 2  =14%; low‐quality evidence); nor between antidepressants and the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.52; 2 studies, 118 participants; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Percental attrition rates due to adverse effects were high in all antidepressant treatments (0% to 32%), but low for NPs (0% to 1.7%). The risk of bias was high in many domains across studies. Seventeen trials (65.4%) gave no information about random sequence generation and only two (7.7%) provided information about allocation concealment. Eighteen studies (69.2%) revealed a high or unclear risk in blinding participants and study personnel; 23 studies had high risk of bias relating to blinding assessors. For the comparison NGA versus placebo, there was relatively high imprecision and heterogeneity due to one outlier study. Although we identified 26 studies, each comparison only contained a few studies and small numbers of participants so the results were imprecise. Authors' conclusions The current review found very low‐quality evidence for NGAs and low‐quality evidence for NPs being effective in treating somatoform symptoms in adults when compared with placebo. There was some evidence that different classes of antidepressants did not differ in efficacy; however, this was limited and of low to very low quality. These results had serious shortcomings such as the high risk of bias, strong heterogeneity in the data, and small sample sizes. Furthermore, the significant effects of antidepressant treatment have to be balanced against the relatively high rates of adverse effects. Adverse effects produced by medication can have amplifying effects on symptom perceptions, particularly in people focusing on somatic symptoms without medical causes. We can only draw conclusions about short‐term efficacy of the pharmacological interventions because no trial included follow‐up assessments. For each of the comparisons where there were available data on acceptability rates (NGAs versus placebo, NPs versus placebo, TCAs versus other medication, and antidepressants versus a combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic), no clear differences between the intervention and comparator were found. Future high‐quality research should be carried out to determine the effectiveness of medications other than antidepressants, to compare antidepressants more thoroughly, and to follow‐up participants over longer periods (the longest follow up was just 12 weeks). Another idea for future research would be to include other outcomes such as functional impairment or dysfunctional behaviours and cognitions as well as the classical outcomes such as symptom severity, depression, or anxiety. Plain language summary Medication as a treatment for long‐term medically unexplained physical symptoms (somatoform disorders): a review of the evidence Who may be interested in this review? ‐ People with long‐term unexplained physical symptoms (somatoform disorders) and their family and friends. ‐ Professionals working with people with somatoform disorders. ‐ Professionals working in chronic pain services. ‐ General practitioners. Why is this review important? Around 6 in 100 people are affected by long‐term physical symptoms that have no clear medical cause (somatoform disorders). Symptoms can include pain, digestive problems, sexual or menstrual problems, breathing problems, and symptoms that mimic brain or nerve damage such as memory loss or sensory problems. Somatoform disorders often cause considerable distress and mean that people spend a lot of time consulting doctors and health professionals to try to find the cause of their symptoms and the correct treatment. Guidelines for the treatment of somatoform disorders recommend that people receive talking therapies alongside medication. In current practice many people are treated 'off label' with medications that are intended for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. However, it is unclear why medications such as antidepressants help to reduce the severity of medically unexplained physical symptoms. What questions does this review aim to answer? ‐ What is the quality of current research on medication as a treatment for somatoform disorders? ‐ Is medication an effective treatment for physical symptoms in somatoform disorders compared with placebo (dummy pill)? ‐ Which types of medication are most effective? ‐ Are natural products such as St. John's wort an effective treatment for somatoform disorders compared with placebo? ‐ How well do people with somatoform disorders tolerate medication or natural products? Which studies did we include in the review? We searched databases to find all studies of medication for somatoform disorders published until January 2014. To be included in the review, studies had to compare medication with either placebo, usual treatment, another medication, or a combination of medication and include adults with a clear diagnosis of somatoform disorders. We included 26 studies in the review with 2159 participants aged between 18 and 77 years. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Although we identified 26 studies, each comparison only contained a few studies and a relatively small number of participants and so the findings must be interpreted with caution. We rated the quality of current research as low or very low and the risks of bias were high in many of the studies. There was not sufficient evidence in order to make a statement about the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of somatoform disorders. New‐generation antidepressants were moderately effective treatments for physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression in somatoform disorders. There was no difference found between the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants and new‐generation antidepressants for the treatment of physical symptoms. There was some evidence that a combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics was more effective than antidepressants alone. Natural products, such as St. John's wort, significantly reduced the severity of physical symptoms compared with placebo. High numbers of people dropped out of treatment due to side effects or lack of effects with antidepressant medication, and low numbers dropped out with natural products. What should happen next? The review authors suggest that future high‐quality research should be carried out to look at the effectiveness of medications other than antidepressants, to compare antidepressants more thoroughly and to follow up participants over longer periods (the longest follow‐up was just 12 weeks). The review authors also suggest that future research should measure changes in people's quality of life and daily functioning as well as physical symptoms and depression/anxiety symptoms.

AB: Abstract - Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia in which daily function is largely intact. This condition may present an opportunity for research into the prevention of dementia. Carbohydrate is an essential and easily accessible macronutrient which influences cognitive performance. A better understanding of carbohydrate‐driven cognitive changes in normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment may suggest ways to prevent or reduce cognitive decline. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of carbohydrates in improving cognitive function in older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 6 April 2012 using the terms: carbohydrates OR carbohydrate OR monosaccharides OR disaccharides OR oligosaccharides OR polysaccharides OR CARBS. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trial databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining the effect of any form of carbohydrates on the cognition or daily functioning of adults aged 55 years or over with normal cognition or MCI. Data collection and analysis One review author selected and retrieved relevant articles for further assessment. The remaining authors independently assessed whether any of the retrieved trials should be included. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.  Main results One study was included. It involved 44 adults aged 60 to 80 years and compared a glucose drink with a saccharin drink, given on only a single occasion. Those receiving the glucose drink were significantly faster in completing the switching condition of the modified Stroop test (F 1, 41 = 10.47; P < 0.01) compared to those receiving the saccharin drink. Participants in the glucose group also showed a significantly smaller dual‐task cost in a computerised test of divided attention compared to the placebo group (F 1, 38 = 8.49; P < 0.01, ƞ 2  = 0.18). As a glucose drink was administered only once, safety, global function, behaviour disturbance, and activities of daily living were not investigated in the study. Authors' conclusions With only one RCT included, there is insufficient evidence to base any recommendations about the use of any form of carbohydrate for enhancing cognitive performance in older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. More studies of many different carbohydrates are needed to tease out complex nutritional issues and to further evaluate memory improvement. Plain language summary There is insufficient evidence for the use of carbohydrates to improve cognitive performance in older adults with normal or mild cognitive impairment Carbohydrates consist of sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. These components are found in a large range of foods and have variable effects on digestion, blood sugar levels, and their impact on health. Despite the evidence accumulated from biological and epidemiological (observational) studies and non‐randomised clinical trials, only one randomised, controlled trial could be included in this review. This study had 44 participants. Participants who were given a single glucose drink showed possible momentary enhancement of cognitive performance compared to those given a saccharin drink. A safety assessment was not reported. We need more studies on different types of carbohydrates, particularly those from fruit, vegetable and whole grain sources, for older adults with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment to understand the role of this nutrient type in the prevention or reduction of cognitive decline.

AB: Abstract - Background Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine its efficacy as an adjunct to standard‐care treatment. Objectives To examine the effects of yoga versus standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2012 and January 29, 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga to standard‐care control. Data collection and analysis The review team independently selected studies, quality rated these, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed mixed‐effect and fixed‐effect models for analyses. We examined data for heterogeneity (I 2  technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results We included eight studies in the review. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There were clear differences in a number of outcomes in favour of the yoga group, although these were based on one study each, with the exception of leaving the study early. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 to 0.88, medium‐quality evidence), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 to 1, medium‐quality evidence), quality of life (average change 36‐Item Short Form Survey (SF‐36) quality‐of‐life subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 to 26.73, low‐quality evidence), and leaving the study early (8 RCTs, n = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 to 1.37, medium‐quality evidence ) . For the outcome of physical health, there was not a clear difference between groups (average change SF‐36 physical‐health subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI ‐2.44 to 15.64, low‐quality evidence). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. This review was subject to a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included global state, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions Even though we found some positive evidence in favour of yoga over standard‐care control, this should be interpreted cautiously in view of outcomes largely based each on one study with limited sample sizes and short‐term follow‐up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality ‐ ‐too weak to indicate that yoga is superior to standard‐care control for the management of schizophrenia. Plain language summary Yoga versus standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga effective as an add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia? Background Yoga comes from ancient India and involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise, improving strength, flexibility, co‐ordination, endurance, and breathing control and concentration. Yoga has also been shown to reduce stress and promote health and feelings of well‐being. Yoga has been used as a complementary therapy for many health conditions, including improving blood pressure control as well as mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Some research suggests that yoga could also be of benefit as an add‐on treatment to reduce the complex symptoms of schizophrenia (such as hearing voices, seeing things, lack of interest in people and activities, tiredness, loss of emotions and withdrawal) and improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga and its use specifically for people with schizophrenia is under‐researched. Study characteristics We included eight short‐term studies (less than six months) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga or standard care in this review. The yoga programmes described varied from 45 minutes to 1 hour in length, and from 8 sessions to a maximum of 36 sessions. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register in January 2015. All studies continued prescribed antipsychotic treatment for the participants. Key results Some results suggest that yoga may be beneficial for people with schizophrenia. Yoga may be beneficial to mental state, social functioning and quality of life but the available evidence is weak and needs to be treated with a good degree of caution. No adverse effects were found by the one trial that reported this outcome. Several other important outcomes were not addressed by the studies, including changes in cognition, economic considerations, and daily living activities. There was not enough good‐quality evidence in this review to claim that yoga should be prescribed as an add‐on to standard care for schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short‐term follow‐up was reported. More, larger, and long‐term trials that focus on important outcomes are therefore necessary. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation. http://mcpin.org/

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with severe mental illness (SMI) have siblings. Siblings are often both natural agents to promote service users’ recovery and vulnerable to mental ill health due to the negative impact of psychosis within the family. Despite a wealth of research evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychoeducation for service users with SMI and their family members, in reducing relapse and promoting compliance with treatment, siblings remain relatively invisible in clinical service settings as well as in research studies. If psychoeducational interventions target siblings and improve siblings' knowledge, coping with caring and overall wellbeing, they could potentially provide a cost‐effective option for supporting siblings with resulting benefits for service users' outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychoeducation compared with usual care or any other intervention in promoting wellbeing and reducing distress of siblings of people affected by SMI. The secondary objective was, if possible, to determine which type of psychoeducation is most effective. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and screened the reference lists of relevant reports and reviews (12th November 2013). We contacted trial authors for unpublished and specific data on siblings' outcomes. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on psychoeducational interventions targeting siblings of all ages (on their own or amongst other family members including service users) of individuals with SMI, using any means and formats of delivery, i.e. individual (family), groups, computer‐based. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data and two other authors independently checked the screening and extraction process. We contacted authors of trials to ascertain siblings' participation in the trials and seek sibling‐specific data in those studies where siblings' data were grouped together with other participants' (most commonly other family members'/carers') outcomes. We calculated the risk difference (RD), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We presented continuous data using the mean difference statistic (MD) and 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and rated quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Main results We found 14 studies that included siblings amongst other family members in receipt of psychoeducational interventions. However, we were only able to include one small trial with relevant and available data (n = 9 siblings out of n = 84 family member/carer‐participants) comparing psychoeducational intervention with standard care in a community care setting, over a duration of 21 months. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on 'siblings' quality of life' (n = 9, MD score 3.80 95% CI ‐0.26 to 7.86,  low quality of evidence ), coping with (family) burden (n = 9, MD ‐8.80 95% CI ‐15.22 to ‐2.34,  low quality of evidence ). No sibling left the study early by one year (n = 9, RD 0.00 CI ‐0.34 to 0.34,  low quality of evidence ). Low quality and insufficient evidence meant we were unable to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on service users' global mental state (n = 9, MD ‐0.60 CI ‐3.54 to 2.38,  low quality of evidence ), their frequency of re‐hospitalisation (n = 9, MD ‐0.70 CI ‐2.46 to 1.06,  low quality of evidence ) or duration of inpatient stay (n = 9, MD ‐2.60 CI ‐6.34 to 1.14,  low quality of evidence ), whether their siblings received psychoeducation or not. No study data were available to address the other primary outcomes: 'siblings' psychosocial wellbeing', 'siblings' distress' and adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Most studies evaluating psychoeducational interventions recruited siblings along with other family members. However, the proportion of siblings in these studies was low and outcomes for siblings were not reported independently from those of other types of family members. Indeed, only data from one study with nine siblings were available for the review. The limited study data we obtained provides no clear good quality evidence to indicate psychoeducation is beneficial for siblings' wellbeing or for clinical outcomes of people affected by SMI. More randomised studies are justified and needed to understand the role of psychoeducation in addressing siblings' needs for information and support. Plain language summary Psychoeducation for brothers and/or sisters of people with severe mental illness (SMI) Review question . This review compares psychoeducation for siblings of people with severe mental illness versus standard care or any other intervention as a means of improving their own wellbeing and quality of life as well as coping with the care‐giving for their mentally ill siblings. Background . Psychoeducation programmes aim to improve knowledge and understanding of mental health. Family members, inlcuding siblings, of people with severe mental illness are often offered psychoeducation. It is supposed that increased knowledge will help the brother or sister to cope more effectively with providing care for their mentally ill sibling and enhance their own wellbeing. Psychoeducational interventions involve an interaction between the information provider and the sibling of the mentally ill person. This can be delivered in different ways, such as face‐to‐face or via online forums or by a mixture of these methods. Study characteristics . A search for randomised trials investigating psychoeducation for the siblings of people with severe mental illness was run in 2013. Results of the search suggest that brothers and sisters form a small proportion of family members participating in studies of this kind. Only one study meeting the review criteria was found. This study included nine siblings and compared a psychoeducational intervention with standard care in a community care setting, over a period of 21 months. Key results . Better outcomes in terms of coping were identified for those siblings who received psychoeducation. However, the number of participants was small and the quality of evidence low, and there is no conclusive evidence that psychoeducation is of benefit for brothers/sisters in this and other important areas (such as wellbeing, quality of life) or for the outcomes of people with mental illness (such as mental state, hospital admission or length of hospital stay). Quality of the evidence . Further studies are needed to understand the role of psychoeducation in specifically helping brothers and/or sisters to cope with providing care for their mentally ill siblings. The scarcity of good quality studies means that it is not possible to assess which type of psychoeducation is the most effective, although interventions using a group format that brings many family members together to receive education and share their experiences seem well‐received by the participants.

AB: Abstract - Background This is an update of our previous 2013 review. Several recent trials and systematic reviews of the impact of exercise on people with dementia are reporting promising findings. Objectives Primary objective Do exercise programs for older people with dementia improve their cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, and mortality? Secondary objectives Do exercise programs for older people with dementia have an indirect impact on family caregivers’ burden, quality of life, and mortality? Do exercise programs for older people with dementia reduce the use of healthcare services (e.g. visits to the emergency department) by participants and their family caregivers? Search methods We identified trials for inclusion in the review by searching ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register, on 4 September 2011, on 13 August 2012, and again on 3 October 2013. Selection criteria In this review, we included randomized controlled trials in which older people, diagnosed with dementia, were allocated either to exercise programs or to control groups (usual care or social contact/activities) with the aim of improving cognition, ADLs, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, and mortality. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services. Data collection and analysis Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We analysed data for summary effects. We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed‐effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random‐effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events. Main results Seventeen trials with 1067 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three included trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration, and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home. Our meta‐analysis revealed that there was no clear evidence of benefit from exercise on cognitive functioning. The estimated standardized mean difference between exercise and control groups was 0.43 (95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.92, P value 0.08; 9 studies, 409 participants). There was very substantial heterogeneity in this analysis (I² value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain, and we rated the quality of this evidence as very low. We found a benefit of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs in six trials with 289 participants. The estimated standardized mean difference between exercise and control groups was 0.68 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.27, P value 0.02). However, again we observed considerable unexplained heterogeneity (I² value 77%) in this meta‐analysis, and we rated the quality of this evidence as very low. This means that there is a need for caution in interpreting these findings. In further analyses, in one trial we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program. The mean difference between exercise and control groups was ‐15.30 (95% CI ‐24.73 to ‐5.87; 1 trial, 40 participants; P value 0.001). There was no apparent risk of bias in this study. In addition, there was no clear evidence of benefit from exercise on neuropsychiatric symptoms (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐4.22 to 3.02; 1 trial, 110 participants; P value .0.75), or depression (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.36; 5 trials, 341 participants; P value 0.16). We could not examine the remaining outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs, as either the appropriate data were not reported, or we did not retrieve trials that examined these outcomes. Authors' conclusions There is promising evidence that exercise programs may improve the ability to perform ADLs in people with dementia, although some caution is advised in interpreting these findings. The review revealed no evidence of benefit from exercise on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest (i.e., mortality, caregiver burden, caregiver quality of life, caregiver mortality, and use of healthcare services). Plain language summary Exercise programs for people with dementia Background In future, as the population ages, the number of people in our communities suffering with dementia will rise dramatically. This will not only affect the quality of life of people with dementia but also increase the burden on family caregivers, community care, and residential care services. Exercise is one lifestyle factor that has been identified as a potential means of reducing or delaying progression of the symptoms of dementia. Study characteristics This review evaluated the results of 17 trials (search dates August 2012 and October 2013), including 1,067 participants, that tested whether exercise programs could improve cognition (which includes such things as memory, reasoning ability and spatial awareness), activities of daily living, behaviour and psychological symptoms (such as depression, anxiety and agitation) in older people with dementia. We also looked for effects on mortality, quality of life, caregivers' experience and use of healthcare services, and for any adverse effects of exercise. Key findings There was some evidence that exercise programs can improve the ability of people with dementia to perform daily activities, but there was a lot of variation among trial results that we were not able to explain. The studies showed no evidence of benefit from exercise on cognition, psychological symptoms, and depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the other outcomes listed above. There was no evidence that exercise was harmful for the participants. We judged the overall quality of evidence behind most of the results to be very low. Conclusion Additional well‐designed trials would allow us to enhance the quality of the review by investigating the best type of exercise program for people with different types and severity of dementia and by addressing all of the outcomes.

AB: Abstract - Background Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non‐conventional agents. Objectives 1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases:  The Cochrane Library  (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non‐conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross‐over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double‐entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures. Main results A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included. In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non‐conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs. For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence). Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence). We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow‐up (four to six months). Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum. Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes. Authors' conclusions Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings. In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data. In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine. However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point. Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. Plain language summary Paroxetine versus other anti‐depressive agents for depression Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms such as appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although medication and psychological treatments are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression. However, head‐to‐head comparisons of such drugs provide contrasting findings as to whether they are effective. This review of the research on the effect of an antidepressant drug called paroxetine was conducted to shed light on the field of drug treatment for depression. In September 2012 we searched, in a wide ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials) which had been completed which compared paroxetine with any other antidepressant in treating people with depression. One hundred and fifteen studies were included in this review, with a total of 26,134 people. We grouped the studies according to the types of drug they compared paroxetine against; we then analysed the combined findings of these groups of studies. For the primary outcome (number of people who responded to treatment) paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine, but less effective than mirtazapine (in the early phase: one to four weeks follow‐up) and probably citalopram (at endpoint: six weeks follow‐up). There was some evidence that paroxetine is less well tolerated than agomelatine and St John's Wort, as more patients allocated to paroxetine experienced at least some side effects (though this finding for St John's Wort was only based on one study). In conclusion, some possibly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other antidepressants exist, but no definitive concluions can be drawn due to the limited number of studies per comparison. In addition, most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry, which means they might potentially have overestimated the effect of paroxetine. Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is a mood disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 3% worldwide, representing the fourth leading cause of disease burden globally. The current standard treatments of psychological therapy and antidepressant medications are not effective for everyone, and psychotropic drugs may be associated with significant adverse effects. Cranial electrical stimulation (CES) treatment, in which a low intensity electrical current is administered through the use of a small, portable electrical device, has been reported to have efficacy in the treatment of depression with minimal adverse effects. This systematic review investigated the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CES in treatment of acute depression compared to sham, or simulated, CES treatment. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of alternating current cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) compared with sham CES for acute depression. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group's specialized register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) to February 24, 2014 This register contains relevant randomized controlled trials from:  The Cochrane Library  (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We examined reference lists of review papers and books on CES. We contacted authors, other experts in the field and CES manufacturing companies for knowledge of suitable published or unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of CES versus sham CES for the acute treatment of depressive disorder in adults aged 18 to 75 years. Data collection and analysis We planned to extract data from the original reports of included studies independently by two authors. The main outcomes to be assessed were: (1) the efficacy of CES in reducing symptoms of depression as reflected in change scores on standardized depression rating scales.  (2) the tolerability of CES treatment to participants, as reflected in rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects. We planned to analyze data using Review Manager 5. Main results No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions There are insufficient methodologically rigorous studies of CES in treatment of acute depression. There is a need for double‐blind randomized controlled trials of CES in the treatment of acute depression. Plain language summary Alternating current cranial electrotherapy stimulation in the treatment of depression Review question We reviewed the evidence on the use of cranial electrical stimulation (CES) in people with acute depression. More specifically, we were interested in examining the evidence from high quality clinical trials in which patients with acute depression were randomly assigned to treatment with either active CES or sham (simulated) CES, We found no high quality studies. Background We wanted to discover whether cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is an effective treatment for depression. Depression is a mood disorder characterized by predominantly depressed mood, appetite change, sleep disturbance, lack of energy, impaired concentration, lack of interest or pleasure, and sometimes suicidal thoughts, resulting in impaired functioning at work and in interpersonal relationships. In order to confirm a diagnosis of depression, these symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. Currently, evidence‐based treatment of depression consists of cognitive‐behavioral psychological therapy or antidepressant medications for mild to moderate depression. For severe depression, antidepressant medications are the recommended treatment. Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for symptoms of depression. CES is a treatment in which a low intensity electrical current is administered to the head through the use of a small, portable electrical device. A sample treatment regimen might consist of daily application of the device for 30 minutes for a month, but treatment instructions vary with the device and condition being treated. In the United States CES devices require a prescription. In most other countries, marketing of CES devices is approved for stress reduction but not specific medical conditions such as depression. Search date The evidence in this review is current to February 2014. Study characteristics We found no studies meeting our criteria for inclusion. Key results We found no high quality clinical trials comparing CES with sham CES in people with acute depression. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CES in treatment of acute depression. Quality of the evidence We found no high quality studies on the use of CES in treatment of acute depression. The key problem with the currently available research is the failure to use standardized rating scales for diagnosis and monitoring of depression, Funding of this review None of the authors received funding from any source to work on this review. Declaration of conflicts of interest None of the authors has any conflict of interest.

AB: Abstract - Background The treatment of schizophrenia with old, 'typical' antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol can be problematic, because many people treated with these drugs will suffer from movement disorders. Amisulpride is said to be an "atypical" antipsychotic which induces less movement disorder and which is effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of amisulpride as compared with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. Search methods The authors carried out electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982‐1999), CINAHL (1982‐1999), Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2000), EMBASE (1980‐1999), LILACS(1982‐1999), MEDLINE (1966‐1999) and PsycLIT (1974‐1999). They checked all identified studies for further trial citations, and sought these studies in the Science Citation Index. They also contacted authors of trials and the manufacturer of amisulpride. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing amisulpride to placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia or other non‐affective serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted and analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of dichotomous data were calculated using a random effects model, and, where possible, the number needed to treat was calculated. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for continuous data. Main results This review currently includes 19 randomised studies with a total of 2443 participants. Most trials were of short duration. Data from 4 trials with 514 participants with predominantly negative symptoms suggest that low‐dose (up to 300mg/day) amisulpride was a more acceptable treatment than placebo (n=514, RR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 3 to 7), it was superior in the improvement of the participants' global state (n=242, RR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6) and in the treatment of negative symptoms (n=167, WMD ‐10.00 CI ‐17.16 to ‐2.84). Compared to typical antipsychotics, the pooled results of a total of fourteen trials suggest that amisulpride was more effective in improving global state (n=651, RR 0.7 CI 0.5 to 0.9, NNT 6 CI 4 to 11), the general mental state (n=695, WMD ‐4.2 CI ‐6.5 to ‐1.9) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (n=506, WMD ‐2.8 CI ‐4.3 to ‐1.3). Regarding positive symptoms, amisulpride was as effective as typical antipsychotics. Amisulpride was less prone to cause at least one general adverse event (n=751, RR 0.9 CI 0.8 to 0.97, NNH 9 CI 6 to 18), one extrapyramidal symptom (n=771, RR 0.7 CI 0.6 to 0.9, NNH 5 CI 4 to 9) or to require the use of antiparkinson medication (n=851, RR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNH 4 CI 3 to 6). No clear differences in other adverse events compared to typical drugs were found. Amisulpride also seemed to be more acceptable than conventional drugs as measured by the outcome 'leaving the studies early' (n=1512, RR 0.8 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 16 CI 9 to 69) than conventional drugs, but this result might have been overestimated due to a publication bias which could not be excluded with certainty. A single trial compared amisulpride to another 'atypical' antipsychotic, risperidone. With the exception of agitation, which was more frequent in the amisulpride group (n=228, RR 3.4 CI 1.2 to 10.1, NNH 11 CI 6 to 50) no significant differences were recorded on efficacy or acceptability. Authors' conclusions This systematic review confirms that amisulpride is an effective 'atypical' antipsychotic drug for those with schizophrenia. Amisulpride may offer a good general profile, at least compared to high‐potency 'typical' antipsychotics. It may also yield better results in some specific outcomes related to efficacy, such as improvement of global state and general negative symptoms. It might be more acceptable and more tolerable than high‐potency conventional antipsychotics, especially regarding extrapyramidal side‐effects.     Longer term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the comparative value of amisulpride, particularly compared to other expensive atypical antipsychotics. These should focus on important outcomes which have not been sufficiently monitored such as service use, family burden and quality of life. Plain language summary Amisulpride for schizophrenia Amisulpride is a new antipsychotic compound. This review suggests that it is more effective than a placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. Amisulpride also has some advantages for the treatment of the general and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and it is associated with less movement disorder than high‐potency conventional drugs. In terms of other side‐effects, no relevant differences were found.

AB: Abstract - Background Aggression, agitation or psychosis occur in the majority of people with dementia at some point in the illness. There have been a number of trials of atypical antipsychotics to treat these symptoms over the last five years, and a systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence in a balanced way. Objectives To determine whether evidence supports the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression, agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease. Search methods The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 7 December 2004 using the terms olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, amisulpride, sertindole, zotepine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone. This Register contains articles from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. Selection criteria Randomised, placebo‐controlled trials, with concealed allocation, where dementia and psychosis and/or aggression were assessed. Data collection and analysis 1. Three reviewers extracted data from included trials   2. Data were pooled where possible, and analysed using appropriate statistical methods   3. Analysis included patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, compared with placebo Main results Sixteen placebo controlled trials have been completed with atypical antipsychotics although only nine had sufficient data to contribute to a meta‐analysis and only five have been published in full in peer reviewed journals. No trials of amisulpiride, sertindole or zotepine were identified which met the criteria for inclusion.   The included trials led to the following results:   1. There was a significant improvement in aggression with risperidone and olanzapine treatment compared to placebo.   2. There was a significant improvement in psychosis amongst risperidone treated patients.   3. Risperidone and olanzapine treated patients had a significantly higher incidence of serious adverse cerebrovascular events (including stroke), extrapyramidal side effects and other important adverse outcomes.   4. There was a significant increase in drop‐outs in risperidone (2 mg) and olanzapine (5‐10 mg) treated patients.   5. The data were insufficient to examine impact upon cognitive function. Authors' conclusions Evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis, but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to those living and working with the patient. Although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta‐analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the Food and Drug Administration suggested a significant increase in mortality (OR 1.7). A peer‐reviewed meta‐analysis (Schneider 2005) of 15 placebo controlled studies (nine unpublished) found similarly increased risk in mortality (OR=1.54, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.02, p=0.01) for the atypical neuroleptics. Plain language summary Atypical antipsychotics benefit people with dementia but the risks of adverse events may outweigh the benefits, particularly with long term treatment Atypical antipsychotics have become the pharmacological treatment of choice for many clinicians in the treatment of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms in people with dementia, and the largest evidence base for double blind placebo controlled trials in this area is for risperidone. Particularly in view of recent safety concerns, a meta‐analysis of efficacy and adverse events to inform clinical practice is timely. Modest efficacy is evident, but the elevated risk of cerebrovascular adverse events, mortality, upper respiratory infections, oedema and extrapyramidal symptoms is a concern, particularly as selective reporting makes interpretation of other potential adverse outcomes impossible.

AB: Abstract - Background Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that may develop after exposure to traumatic events. Substance use disorder (SUD) is a behavioural disorder in which the use of one or more substances is associated with heightened levels of distress, clinically significant impairment of functioning, or both. PTSD and SUD frequently occur together. The comorbidity is widely recognised as being difficult to treat and is associated with poorer treatment completion and poorer outcomes than for either condition alone. Several psychological therapies have been developed to treat the comorbidity, however there is no consensus about which therapies are most effective. Objectives To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies aimed at treating traumatic stress symptoms, substance misuse symptoms, or both in people with comorbid PTSD and SUD in comparison with control conditions (usual care, waiting‐list conditions, and no treatment) and other psychological therapies. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group’s Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) all years to 11 March 2015. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov, contacted experts, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of individual or group psychological therapies delivered to individuals with PTSD and comorbid substance use, compared with waiting‐list conditions, usual care, or minimal intervention or to other psychological therapies. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 14 studies with 1506 participants, of which 13 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Most studies involved adult populations. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings. We performed four comparisons investigating the effects of psychological therapies with a trauma‐focused component and non‐trauma‐focused interventions against treatment as usual/minimal intervention and other active psychological therapies. Comparisons were stratified for individual‐ or group‐based therapies. All active interventions were based on cognitive behavioural therapy. Our main findings were as follows. Individual‐based psychological therapies with a trauma‐focused component plus adjunctive SUD intervention was more effective than treatment as usual (TAU)/minimal intervention for PTSD severity post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.72 to ‐0.10; 4 studies; n = 405; very low‐quality evidence) and at 3 to 4 and 5 to 7 months' follow‐up. There was no evidence of an effect for level of drug/alcohol use post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.13; 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; 3 studies; n = 388; very low‐quality evidence), but there was a small effect in favour of individual psychological therapy at 5 to 7 months (SMD ‐0.28; 95% CI ‐0.48 to ‐0.07; 3 studies; n = 388) when compared against TAU. Fewer participants completed trauma‐focused therapy than TAU (risk ratio (RR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96; 3 studies; n = 316; low‐quality evidence). Individual‐based psychological therapy with a trauma‐focused component did not perform better than psychological therapy for SUD only for PTSD severity (mean difference (MD) ‐3.91; 95% CI ‐19.16 to 11.34; 1 study; n = 46; low‐quality evidence) or drug/alcohol use (MD ‐1.27; 95% CI ‐5.76 to 3.22; 1 study; n = 46; low‐quality evidence). Findings were based on one small study. No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.36; 1 study; n = 62; low‐quality evidence). Non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapies did not perform better than TAU/minimal intervention for PTSD severity when delivered on an individual (SMD ‐0.22; 95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.39; 1 study; n = 44; low‐quality evidence) or group basis (SMD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.16; 4 studies; n = 513; low‐quality evidence). There were no data on the effects on drug/alcohol use for individual therapy. There was no evidence of an effect on the level of drug/alcohol use for group‐based therapy (SMD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.31; 4 studies; n = 414; very low‐quality evidence). A post‐hoc analysis for full dose of a widely established group therapy called Seeking Safety showed reduced drug/alcohol use post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.67; 95% CI ‐1.14 to ‐0.19; 2 studies; n = 111), but not at subsequent follow‐ups. Data on the number of participants completing therapy were not for individual‐based therapy. No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion for group‐based therapy (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45; 2 studies; n = 217; low‐quality evidence). Non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapy did not perform better than psychological therapy for SUD only for PTSD severity (SMD ‐0.26; 95% CI ‐1.29 to 0.77; 2 studies; n = 128; very low‐quality evidence) or drug/alcohol use (SMD 0.22; 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.57; 2 studies; n = 128; low‐quality evidence). No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; 2 studies; n = 128; very low‐quality evidence). Several studies reported on adverse events. There were no differences between rates of such events in any comparison. We rated several studies as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, including for detection bias and attrition bias. Authors' conclusions We assessed the evidence in this review as mostly low to very low quality. Evidence showed that individual trauma‐focused psychological therapy delivered alongside SUD therapy did better than TAU/minimal intervention in reducing PTSD severity post‐treatment and at long‐term follow‐up, but only reduced SUD at long‐term follow‐up. All effects were small, and follow‐up periods were generally quite short. There was evidence that fewer participants receiving trauma‐focused therapy completed treatment. There was very little evidence to support use of non‐trauma‐focused individual‐ or group‐based integrated therapies. Individuals with more severe and complex presentations (e.g. serious mental illness, individuals with cognitive impairment, and suicidal individuals) were excluded from most studies in this review, and so the findings from this review are not generalisable to such individuals. Some studies suffered from significant methodological problems and some were underpowered, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Further research is needed in this area. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for post‐traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder Who may be interested in this review? • Individuals with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) and their families and friends. • Healthcare providers for individuals with PTSD and SUD. Why is this review important? Many people have PTSD or SUD. Both conditions can impact everyday functioning. A number of different psychological therapies are successful at treating PTSD and SUD when they occur separately. However, PTSD and SUD often occur together, and it may be harder to treat individuals with both PTSD and SUD. A number of psychological therapies have been developed to treat people with both PTSD and SUD, but it is not clear how effective these therapies are. What questions does this review aim to answer? We sought to find out whether psychological therapies are effective in treating people with PTSD and SUD in comparison to control conditions and other psychological therapies. Which studies were included in the review? We searched scientific databases to find all published and unpublished studies of psychological therapies to treat people with PTSD and SUD up to 11 March 2015. We included 14 studies with 1506 participants. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The evidence showed that individual trauma‐focused psychological therapy delivered alongside SUD therapies was more effective in reducing PTSD compared to treatment as usual. This result was found both straight after treatment and at long‐term follow‐up. However, SUD severity only declined at long‐term follow‐up. More people dropped out of the trauma‐focused therapy compared with treatment as usual. Overall, the benefits of trauma‐focused treatment were small. We found little evidence for the benefit of individual‐ or group‐based non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapies. For group‐based therapies, we found that substance use was reduced post‐treatment when participants were offered a full course of 25 sessions of the therapy 'Seeking Safety', which was delivered in a group setting. However, this positive effect did not continue at later follow‐up points. The level of drop‐out was high across all studies. We graded the quality of evidence as low to very low. This review includes a small number of studies. Some included studies were poorly designed, and most studies were small. There was also considerable variation in the way that the therapies and control therapies were delivered. It is likely that participants in the included studies received a range of other stabilising interventions alongside trauma‐focused treatment, and we found no evidence to support the delivery of trauma‐focused therapies without SUD‐focused therapies. It is therefore possible that our findings will change as further evidence of higher quality is accumulated. Healthcare providers should exercise caution when considering whether to provide therapies described in this review.

AB: Abstract - Background Long‐acting depot injections of drugs such as flupenthixol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long‐term maintenance treatment for schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot neuroleptic preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses, in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Search methods We identified relevant trials by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in March 2009 and then for this update version, a search was run in April 2013. The register is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that focused on people with schizophrenia or other similar psychotic disorders where flupenthixol decanoate had been compared with placebo or other antipsychotic drugs were included. All clinically relevant outcomes were sought. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. We summated normal continuous data using mean difference (MD), and 95% CIs using a fixed‐effect model. We presented scale data only for those tools that had attained prespecified levels of quality. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) we created 'Summary of findings tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results The review currently includes 15 randomised controlled trials with 626 participants. No trials compared flupenthixol decanoate with placebo. One small study compared flupenthixol decanoate with an oral antipsychotic (penfluridol). Only two outcomes were reported with this single study, and it demonstrated no clear differences between the two preparations as regards leaving the study early (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 3.00, CI 0.33 to 27.23, very low quality evidence ) and requiring anticholinergic medication (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.19, CI 0.77 to 1.83,  very low quality evidence ). Ten studies in total compared flupenthixol decanoate with other depot preparations, though not all studies reported on all outcomes of interest. There were no significant differences between depots for outcomes such as relapse at medium term (n = 221, 5 RCTs, RR 1.30, CI 0.87 to 1.93,  low quality evidence ), and no clinical improvement at short term (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.67, CI 0.36 to 1.23,  low quality evidence ). There was no difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early at short/medium term (n = 161, 4 RCTs, RR 1.23, CI 0.76 to 1.99,  low quality evidence ) nor with numbers of people requiring anticholinergic medication at short/medium term (n = 102, 3 RCTs, RR 1.38, CI 0.75 to 2.25,  low quality evidence ). Three studies in total compared high doses (100 to 200 mg) of flupenthixol decanoate with the standard doses (˜40mg) per injection. Two trials found relapse at medium term (n = 18, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.27 to 3.69,  low quality evidence ) to be similar between the groups. However people receiving a high dose had slightly more favourable medium term mental state results on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD ‐10.44, CI ‐18.70 to ‐2.18,  low quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in the use of anticholinergic medications to deal with side effects at short term (2 RCTs n = 47, RR 1.12, CI 0.83 to 1.52  very low quality evidence ). One trial comparing a very low dose of flupenthixol decanoate (˜6 mg) with a low dose (˜9 mg) per injection reported no difference in relapse rates (n = 59, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, CI 0.10 to 1.15,  low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions In the current state of evidence, there is nothing to choose between flupenthixol decanoate and other depot antipsychotics. From the data reported in clinical trials, it would be understandable to offer standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. However, data reported are of low or very low quality and this review highlights the need for large, well‐designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the effects of flupenthixol decanoate. Plain language summary Depot flupenthixol decanoate for schizophrenia or other similar mental illnesses Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects thinking and perception. It often develops in early adult‐hood and can have a lifelong impact on not only the mental well‐being of the sufferer, but their social and general functioning. Worldwide around 15 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with schizophrenia every year. The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotics are usually given as tablets by mouth (orally). However, people with mental illness often have difficulties with accepting medication (compliance). Their illness affects their thinking, which can erode their understanding of their illness and they often do not see the need for treatment. Taking antipsychotics can also have unpleasant side effects. Oral medication requires regular self‐administration otherwise effectiveness is reduced and the risk of relapse is high. A solution to poor compliance is depot medication where medication is given by injection and is slowly released over a period of weeks. For people with schizophrenia it was hoped to be able to maintain care in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses. Initial enthusiasm and the favourable results of clinical trials gave rise to the extensive use of depots as a means of long‐term treatment. Flupenthixol decanoate is one of the most widely used depot antipsychotics in the UK. This review looks at the effectiveness of depot flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with no active treatment (placebo), oral antipsychotics and other depot preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. An electronic search for relevant trials was carried out in 2013. Fifteen trials with 626 participants could be included. All evidence from these trials was rated by the authors to be  low  or  very low quality.  Currently, from the data reported, there is nothing to choose between depot flupenthixol decanoate and other depot or oral antipsychotics. There was some evidence that it would be understandable to offer a standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. Overall, this review highlights the lack of evidence based information available for the review question and the need for large, well‐designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the medical, social, personal and economic effects of flupenthixol decanoate.

AB: Abstract - Background Perphenazine is an old phenothiazine antipsychotic with a potency similar to haloperidol. It has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan. Objectives To examine the clinical effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We updated our original search using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (September 2013), references of all included studies and contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of included studies in order to identify further trials. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials that compared perphenazine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. We excluded trials of depot formulations of perphenazine. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts. We ordered papers, inspected and quality assessed them. We extracted data, again working independently. If loss to follow‐up was greater than 50% we considered results as 'prone to bias'. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD), both with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed quality of data using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluationtool) and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results Thirty‐one studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with a total of 4662 participants (of which 4522 were receiving the drugs relevant to our comparison) and presented data that could be used for at least one comparison. The trial centres were located in Europe (especially Scandinavia), Japan and Northern America. When comparing perphenazine with placebo, for our primary outcome of clinical response, results favoured perphenazine with significantly more people receiving placebo rated as either 'no better or deterioration' for global state than people receiving perphenazine (1 RCT, n = 61 RR 0.32 CI 0.13 to 0.78,  very low quality evidence ). More people receiving placebo relapsed, although not a statistically significant number (1 RCT, n = 48, RR 0.14 CI 0.02 to 1.07,  very low quality evidence ). Death was not reported in the perphenazine versus placebo comparison. Experiences of dystonia were equivocal between groups (1 RCT, n = 48, RR 1.00 CI 0.07 to 15.08,  very low quality evidence ); other outcomes not reported in this comparison include serious adverse events, economic outcomes, and service use and hospitalisation. For the comparison of perphenazine versus any other antipsychotic drugs, no real differences in effect between the drugs were found. There was no significant difference between groups for those considered 'no better or deterioration' (17 RCTs, n = 1879, RR 1.04 CI 0.91 to 1.17,  very low quality evidence ). For mental state outcome of 'no effect' of the study drug, there was again no significant difference between groups (4 RCTs, n = 383, RR 1.24 CI 0.61 to 2.52,  very low quality evidence ). Death was not reported in any of the included studies. There was no significant difference in rates of dystonia with perphenazine versus any other antipsychotic drugs (4 RCTs, n = 416, RR 1.36 CI 0.23 to 8.16,  very low quality evidence ), nor was there a significant difference between groups for serious adverse events (2 RCTs, n = 1760, RR 0.98 CI 0.68 to 1.41,  very low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Although perphenazine has been used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparators used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions. All data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence. At best we can say that perphenazine showed similar effects and adverse events as several of the other antipsychotic drugs. Since perphenazine is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used compound, further trials are justified to clarify the properties of this classical antipsychotic drug. Plain language summary Perphenazine for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Perphenazine is an old antipsychotic drug (typical or first‐generation) formulated in the 1950s with an effectiveness similar to another antipsychotic drug called haloperidol. Perphenazine is particularly popular in Northern European countries and Japan. The aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness and safety of perphenazine for schizophrenia. A search for relevant randomised studies was run in September 2013. The review authors included 31 studies that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either perphenazine or placebo or another antipsychotic drug. A total of 4662 people participated in these studies. The quality of evidence presented by the trials was rated by the review authors to be very low quality. It was found that perphenazine was no better or worse than other older antipsychotic drugs in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, and like other older antipsychotic drugs, the side effects of perphenazine included tremors, uncontrollable shaking, the inability to sit still and feeling restless. Although perphenazine has been used for more than 50 years, poor studies with bad reporting of information mean that it is difficult to draw more clear findings and conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of perphenazine. However, perphenazine is inexpensive and a popular antipsychotic drug in many countries, so further research and trials on its effectiveness and safety are much needed.

AB: Abstract - Background The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical practice guideline on the treatment of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first‐line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand‐searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double‐entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side‐effects). Main results A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea. Authors' conclusions This systematic review and meta‐analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre‐specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians were not reported in any of the included studies. Plain language summary Sertraline versus other antidepressive agents for depression Depression is the fourth leading cause of disease burden worldwide and is expected to show a rising trend over the next 20 years. Depression is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Sertraline, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is a potent and specific inhibitor of serotonin uptake into the presynaptic terminal, with a modest activity as inhibitor of dopamine uptake. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Fifty‐nine randomised controlled trials (about 10,000 participants) were included in the review. The review showed evidence of differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability between sertraline and other antidepressants, with meta‐analyses highlighting a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressants, both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, in a homogeneous sample of clinical trials, using conservative statistical methods. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre‐specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Nevertheless, based on currently available evidence, results from this review suggest that sertraline might be a strong candidate as the initial choice of antidepressant in people with acute major depression.

AB: Abstract - Background Over approximately the last fifteen years, early psychological interventions, such as psychological 'debriefing', have been increasingly used following psychological trauma. Whilst this intervention has become popular and its use has spread to several settings, empirical evidence for its efficacy is noticeably lacking. This is the third update of a review of single session psychological "debriefing", first having been undertaken in 1997. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of brief psychological debriefing for the management of psychological distress after trauma, and the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder. Search methods Electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, PILOTS, Biosis, Pascal, Occ.Safety and Health,SOCIOFILE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, PSYNDEX, SIGLE, LILACS, CCTR, CINAHL, NRR, Hand search of Journal of Traumatic Stress. Contact with leading researchers. Selection criteria The focus of RCTs was on persons recently (one month or less) exposed to a traumatic event. The intervention consisted of a single session only, and involved some form of emotional processing/ventilation, by encouraging recollection/reworking of the traumatic event, accompanied by normalisation of emotional reaction to the event. Data collection and analysis 15 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable, but the majority of trials scored poorly. Data from 6 trials could not be included the meta‐analyses. These trials are summarised in the text. Main results Single session individual debriefing did not prevent the onset of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nor reduce psychological distress, compared to control. At one year, one trial reported a significantly increased risk of PTSD in those receiving debriefing (OR 2.51 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.09). Those receiving the intervention reported no reduction in PTSD severity at 1‐4 months (SMD 0.11 (95%CI 0.10 to 0.32)), 6‐13 months (SMD 0.26 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.50)), or 3 years (SMD 0.17 (95%CI ‐0.34 to 0.67)). There was also no evidence that debriefing reduced general psychological morbidity, depression or anxiety, or that it was superior to an educational intervention. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence that single session individual psychological debriefing is a useful treatment for the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder after traumatic incidents. Compulsory debriefing of victims of trauma should cease. A more appropriate response could involve a 'screen and treat' model (NICE 2005). Plain language summary Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) This review concerns the efficacy of single session psychological "debriefing" in reducing psychological distress and preventing the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events. Psychological debriefing is either equivalent to, or worse than, control or educational interventions in preventing or reducing the severity of PTSD, depression, anxiety and general psychological morbidity. There is some suggestion that it may increase the risk of PTSD and depression. The routine use of single session debriefing given to non selected trauma victims is not supported. No evidence has been found that this procedure is effective.

AB: Abstract - Background Sulpiride is a relatively old antipsychotic drug reputed to have a low incidence of adverse effects and an effect on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This relatively inexpensive antipsychotic drug has a similar neuropharmacological profile to several novel atypical drugs. Objectives To evaluate the effects of sulpiride for schizophrenia and other similar serious mental illnesses in comparison with placebo. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (September 2008) and references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. We updated this search 7th November 2012. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sulpiride with placebo for people with schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia‐like psychoses. The primary outcome of interest was clinically significant response in global state. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re‐inspected and quality‐assessed these. IMO and JW extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using a random‐effects risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. Where continuous data were included, we analysed these data using random‐effects mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. Main results No new trials were included from the 2012 search. The review still includes two trials of short duration comparing sulpiride with placebo (total n = 113). No study reported our primary outcome of interest of 'global state: clinically significant response', nor our secondary outcomes of interest of 'quality of life', 'severe adverse effects', and 'safety assessments'. As regards mental state, there were no clear differences between groups for either positive or negative symptoms; measured positive symptoms using the Manchester scale were skewed and therefore not included in meta‐analysis (n = 18, 1 RCT,  very low quality evidence ). Measured negative symptoms using the Manchester scale also demonstrated no clear difference (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD ‐3.0 CI ‐1.66 to 1.06,  very low quality evidence ). Few people left these studies by three months (n = 113, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.25 to 4.00). One subscore finding demonstrated a significant improvement in social behaviour using the Current Behaviour Schedule (CBS) when receiving placebo (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD ‐2.90 CI ‐5.60 to ‐0.20). There were no data for many important outcomes such as global outcomes, service use or adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Sulpiride may be an effective antipsychotic drug but evidence of its superiority over placebo from randomised trials is very limited. Practice will have to use evidence from sources other than trials until better evidence is generated. Plain language summary Sulpiride versus placebo for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with ‘positive symptoms’ such as hallucinations (hearing voices and seeing things) and delusions (having strange beliefs). People with schizophrenia also suffer from disorganisation and ‘negative symptoms’ (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). People with schizophrenia may find it hard to socialise and find employment. Schizophrenia is considered one of the most burdensome illnesses in the world. For some people it can be a lifelong condition.    People with schizophrenia are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. More recently developed antipsychotic drugs (second generation or atypical) are more expensive and thought to have fewer side effects than the older ones (first generation or typical). These side effects can include distressing movement disorders; as a results, many people find the older drugs difficult to tolerate and prefer the second generation drugs. However, in many developing countries the cost of medication can be a major factor in prescribing, so the first generation drugs are the most widely used. Sulpiride is a first generation antipsychotic drug, but is said to cause fewer side effects. It has been suggested that sulpiride may be more effective than other older drugs (such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol) for treating the negative symptoms and social withdrawal of schizophrenia. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of sulpiride for schizophrenia compared to placebo (‘dummy’ treatment). Two short‐term (12 weeks) studies with a total of 113 people are included. Information was limited and poorly reported. The inclusion of two small studies with small sample sizes meant that resulting data were not overly robust or meaningful. Overall no clear difference was noted between those receiving sulpiride and those receiving placebo for mental state or for leaving the study early. There was no information on other important outcomes, including: general functioning, service use, hospital admission, employment, family burden, satisfaction with care and side effects. The use of sulpiride seems to be based on clinical experience rather than strong evidence. Its widespread use in developing countries might have more to do with its lower cost than its effectiveness. Longer, well‐planned, better conducted and reported randomised control trials would contribute to our knowledge about the effectiveness and potential side effects of this drug.

AB: Abstract - Background In traditional didactic teaching, the learner has a passive role, digesting the knowledge presented by the teacher. Stimulating and active teaching processes may be better at instilling information than more pedestrian approaches. Games involving repetition, reinforcement, association and use of multiple senses have been proposed as part of experiential learning. Objectives To assess the effects of educational games on the knowledge attainment and clinical skills of mental health professionals compared to the effects of standard teaching approaches. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2005), AMED (1998 ‐ November 2005), British Nursing Index (November 2005), Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2005), CINAHL (November 2005) EMBASE (November 2005), Educational Resources Information Centre on CSA (1966 ‐ November 2005), MEDLINE (November 2005) and PsycINFO (November 2005). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing any educational game aiming at increasing knowledge and/or skills with a standard educational approach for mental health professionals. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For individual person data we calculated the Odds Ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a fixed effects model. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed effects model. Main results We identified one trial (n=34) of an educational game for mental health nursing students of only a few hours follow up. For an outcome we arbitrarily defined ('no academically important improvement [a 10% improvement in scores]') those allocated to educational games fared considerably better than students in the standard education techniques group (OR 0.06 CI 0.01 to 0.3, NNT 3 CI 2 to 4). On average those in the games group scored six more points than the control students on a test of questions relevant to psychosis set to the standard of the mental health nursing curriculum of the day (WMD 6.00 CI 2.6 to 9.4). Authors' conclusions Current limited evidence suggests educational games could help mental health students gain more points in their tests, especially if they have left revision to the last minute. This salient study should be refined and repeated. Plain language summary Educational games for mental health professionals Standard teaching techniques in health care often contain traditional didactic elements. Learning from traditional didactic teaching has never been a very active process and can subsequently be tedious and tiring. In this review we wished to investigate the effects of more interactive ways of teaching mental health professionals. We identified one relevant trial which, although very small and short, did suggest quite a considerable short term positive effect for the more interactive teaching approach. On average, mental health nursing students who had been taught using this method scored six points more in a follow‐up test than students allocated to the standard teaching techniques. This interesting experiment should be reproduced to determine whether the increased knowledge is sustained and, if so, whether this produces better skills and attitudes.

AB: Abstract - Background Drugs used to treat psychotic illnesses may take weeks to be effective. In the interim, additional 'as required' doses of medication can be used to calm patients in psychiatric wards. The practice is widespread, with 20% to 50% of people on acute psychiatric wards receiving at least one 'as required' dose of psychotropic medication during their admission. Objectives To compare the effects of 'as required' medication regimens with regular patterns of medication for the treatment of psychotic symptoms or behavioural disturbance, thought to be secondary to psychotic illness. These regimens may be given alone or in addition to any regular psychotropic medication for the long‐term treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials, in November 2001, March 2006, July 2012 andOctober 2013. Selection criteria We aimed to include all relevant randomised controlled trials involving hospital inpatients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses, comparing any regimen of medication administered for the short‐term relief of behavioural disturbance, or psychotic symptoms, to be given at the discretion of ward staff ('as required', 'prn') with fixed non‐discretionary patterns of drug administration of the same drug(s). This was in addition to regular psychotropic medication for the long‐term treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses where prescribed. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected abstracts and papers for inclusion. If trials had been found, we would have extracted data from the papers and quality assessed the data. For dichotomous data we would have calculated the risk ratios (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We would have conducted analyses on an intention‐to‐treat basis. If data were available we would have completed a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We have not been able to identify any randomised trials comparing 'as required' medication regimens to regular regimens of the same drug. Our main outcomes of interest were important changes in (i) mental state, (ii) behaviour, (iii) dose of medication used, (iv) adverse events, (v) satisfaction with care and (iv) cost of care. Authors' conclusions There is currently no evidence from within randomised trials to support this common practice. Current practice is based on clinical experience and habit rather than high quality evidence. Plain language summary 'As required' medication for seriously mentally ill people in hospital Review question This review attempts to find evidence to find out whether the use of 'as required' medication is good clinical practice or not, when compared to the same drug given regularly, for people with schizophrenia who are in hospital. Searches for randomised trials investigating this question have been run by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2001, 2006, 2012 and 2013. Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions) that can be upsetting or frightening, or both. These symptoms of schizophrenia can cause agitation, aggression and distress. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs usually take several weeks to work. In the meantime, for people in distress in hospital, other additional medication can be given when needed (if clinicians think it is appropriate), until regular antipsychotics start to work. This 'as required' medication is often used to help people feel less anxious and to reduce disturbed behaviour. 'As required' medication is usually written on the drug chart by the clinician so that nurses can administer it at their discretion and in the doctor's absence. Although there are many advantages to this practice, there are also potential disadvantages. For example, it may cause difficulty in knowing which medication (the prescribed medication or the 'as required' medication) has been effective and staff on the ward might use this additional medication too readily for individuals who are upset, rather than spending time with them or considering other approaches. Study characteristics The search only found trials that compared two different drugs, both of which were used 'as required'. The review authors found no trials that compared only giving additional medication when needed with regular doses of the same medication. Key results The review authors found no trials that could be included in the review. Although the practice of using medication 'as required' is common, there is currently no good evidence as to whether this is the best way of helping people when compared to them being given a regular dose of the same medication. Quality of the evidence The review authors found no trials that compared 'as required' with regular medication. 'As required' medication, though used widely, has not been evaluated scientifically. A well designed, conducted and reported randomised trial would help to gather more evidence.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second generation ("atypical") antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics. Objectives To evaluate the effects of olanzapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods 1. Electronic searching   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 2. Reference searching   We inspected the reference of all identified studies for more trials. 3. Personal contact   We contacted the first author of each included study for missing information. 4. Drug companies   We contacted the manufacturers of all atypical antipsychotics included for additional data. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials that used at least single‐blind (rater‐blind) design, comparing oral olanzapine with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random effects model. Main results The review currently includes 50 studies and 9476 participants which provided data for six comparisons (olanzapine compared to amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone). The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) more than aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=794, WMD ‐4.96 CI ‐8.06 to ‐1.85), quetiapine (10 RCTs, n=1449, WMD ‐3.66 CI ‐5.39 to ‐1.93), risperidone (15 RCTs, n=2390, WMD ‐1.94 CI ‐3.31 to ‐0.58) and ziprasidone (4 RCTs, n=1291, WMD ‐8.32 CI ‐10.99 to ‐5.64), but not more than amisulpride or clozapine. This somewhat better efficacy was confirmed by fewer participants in the olanzapine groups leaving the studies early due to inefficacy of treatment compared to quetiapine (8 RCTs, n=1563, RR 0.56 CI 0.44 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 6 to 50), risperidone (14 RCTs, n=2744, RR 0.78 CI 0.62 to 0.98, NNT 50 CI 17 to 100) and ziprasidone (5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 0.64 CI 0.51 to 0.79, NNT 17, CI 11 to 33). Fewer participants in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=876, RR 0.56 CI 0.41 to 0.77, NNT 11 CI 7 to 25) and ziprasidone (2 RCTs, n=766, RR 0.65 CI 0.45 to 0.93, NNT 17 CI 9 to 100) treatment groups, but not in the clozapine group (1 RCT, n=980, RR 1.28 CI 1.02 to 1.61, NNH not estimable), had to be re‐hospitalised in the trials. Except for clozapine, all comparators induced less weight gain than olanzapine (olanzapine compared to amisulpride: 3 RCTs, n=671, WMD 2.11kg CI 1.29kg to 2.94kg; aripiprazole: 1 RCT, n=90, WMD 5.60kg CI 2.15kg to 9.05kg; quetiapine: 7 RCTs, n=1173, WMD 2.68kg CI 1.10kg to 4.26kg; risperidone: 13 RCTs, n=2116, WMD 2.61kg CI 1.48kg to 3.74kg; ziprasidone: 5 RCTs, n=1659, WMD 3.82kg CI 2.96kg to 4.69kg). Associated problems such as glucose and cholesterol increase were usually also more frequent in the olanzapine group. Other differences in adverse effects were less well documented. Nevertheless, olanzapine may be associated with slightly more extrapyramidal side effects than quetiapine (use of antiparkinson medication (6 RCTs, n=1090, RR 2.05 CI 1.26 to 3.32, NNH 25 CI 14 to 100), but less than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication 13 RCTs, n=2599, RR 0.78 CI 0.65 to 0.95, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100) and ziprasidone (use of antiparkinson medication 4 RCTs, n=1732, RR 0.70 CI 0.50 to 0.97, NNH not estimable). It may also increase prolactin somewhat more than aripiprazole, clozapine and quetiapine, but clearly less so than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=1291, WMD ‐22.84 CI ‐27.98 to ‐17.69). Authors' conclusions Olanzapine may be a somewhat more efficacious drug than some other second generation antipsychotic drugs. This small superiority in efficacy needs to be weighed against a larger weight gain and associated metabolic problems than most other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except clozapine. These conclusions are tentative due to the large number of people leaving the studies early which possibly limits the validity of the findings. Further large, well‐designed trials are necessary to establish the relative effects of different second generation antipsychotic drugs. Plain language summary Olanzapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review examined the effects of olanzapine compared to other second generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 50 relevant studies with 9476 participants, comparing olanzapine with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. Comparisons of olanzapine with the second generation antipsychotic drugs sertindole or zotepine are currently not available. Olanzapine was somewhat more efficacious than aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, whereas there was no efficacy difference compared to amisulpride and clozapine. The main disadvantage of olanzapine was its higher weight gain and associated metabolic problems compared to all other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except for clozapine.

AB: Abstract - Background There is increasing evidence that physical activity supports healthy ageing. Exercise is helpful for cardiovascular, respiratory and musculoskeletal systems, among others. Aerobic activity, in particular, improves cardiovascular fitness and, based on recently reported findings, may also have beneficial effects on cognition among older people. Objectives To assess the effect of aerobic physical activity, aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness, on cognitive function in older people without known cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 2 of 4, 2013), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (Ovid SP 1974 to August 2013), PEDro, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to August 2013), CINAHL (all dates to August 2013), LILACS (all dates to August 2013), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov) and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 24 August 2013, with no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect on cognitive function of aerobic physical activity programmes with any other active intervention, or no intervention, in cognitively healthy participants aged over 55 years. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted the data from included trials. We grouped cognitive outcome measures into eleven categories covering attention, memory, perception, executive functions, cognitive inhibition, cognitive speed and motor function. We used the mean difference (or standardised mean difference) between groups as the measure of the treatment effect and synthesised data using a random‐effects model. We conducted separate analyses to compare aerobic exercise interventions with no intervention and with other exercise, social or cognitive interventions. Also, we performed analyses including only trials in which an increase in the cardiovascular fitness of participants had been demonstrated. Main results Twelve trials including 754 participants met our inclusion criteria. Trials were from eight to 26 weeks in duration. We judged all trials to be at moderate or high risk of bias in at least some domains. Reporting of some risk of bias domains was poor. Our analyses comparing aerobic exercise to any active intervention showed no evidence of benefit from aerobic exercise in any cognitive domain. This was also true of our analyses comparing aerobic exercise to no intervention. Analysing only the subgroup of trials in which cardiorespiratory fitness improved in the aerobic exercise group showed that this improvement did not coincide with improvements in any cognitive domains assessed. Our subgroup analyses of aerobic exercise versus flexibility or balance interventions also showed no benefit of aerobic exercise in any cognitive domain. Dropout rates did not differ between aerobic exercise and control groups. No trial reported on adverse effects. Overall none of our analyses showed a cognitive benefit from aerobic exercise even when the intervention was shown to lead to improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence in the available data from RCTs that aerobic physical activities, including those which successfully improve cardiorespiratory fitness, have any cognitive benefit in cognitively healthy older adults. Larger studies examining possible moderators are needed to confirm whether or not aerobic training improves cognition. Plain language summary Aerobic exercise to improve cognitive function in older people without known cognitive impairment Aerobic exercise is beneficial for healthy ageing. It has been suggested that the increased fitness brought about by aerobic exercise may help to maintain good cognitive function in older age. We looked for randomised controlled trials of aerobic exercise programmes for people over the age of 55 years, without pre‐existing cognitive problems, which measured effects on both fitness and cognition. The aerobic exercise programmes could be compared with no intervention (e.g. being on a waiting list for the exercise group) or with other kinds of activity (including non‐aerobic exercises such as strength or balance exercises, or social activities). In this Cochrane Review, 12 trials including 754 participants met our inclusion criteria. Eight of the 12 trials reported that the aerobic exercise interventions resulted in increased fitness of the trained group. However, when we combined results across the trials, we did not find any significant benefits of aerobic exercise or increased fitness on any aspect of cognition. Many included trials had problems with their methods or reporting which reduced our confidence in the findings. We did not find evidence that aerobic exercise or increased fitness improves cognitive function in older people. However, it remains possible that it may be helpful for particular subgroups of people, or that more intense exercise programmes could be beneficial. Therefore further research in this area is necessary.

AB: Abstract - Background A previous Cochrane review ( James 2005 ) showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non‐CBT active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long‐term effects of CBT.  Objectives To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait‐list controls; (b) active non‐CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long‐term effects of CBT. Search methods Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－ The Cochrane Library  (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  (DSM) or the  International Classification of Diseases  (ICD) for an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. Data collection and analysis The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random‐effects model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child’s anxiety symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Main results Forty‐one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.34, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.05, I² = 30%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 3.0 (95% CI 1.75 to 3.03). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than non‐CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow‐up studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication at follow‐up, is limited and inconclusive. Plain language summary Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people Why is this review important? Many children and young people suffer from anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety are more likely to have difficulty with friendships, family life and school. Treatments for children and young people with anxiety can help to prevent them from developing mental health problems or drug and alcohol misuse in later life. Talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to deal with anxiety by using new ways of thinking. Many parents and children prefer to try talking therapies rather than medication such as antidepressants. Who will be interested in this review? Parents, children and young people; people working in education; professionals working in mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2005, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety. This update aims to answer the following questions: • Is CBT more effective than no therapy (waiting list)? • Is CBT more effective than other 'active' therapies such as self‐help books aimed at children and young people? • Is CBT more effective than medication? • Does CBT help to reduce symptoms of anxiety for children and young people in the longer term? Which studies were included in the review? Search databases were used to find all high‐quality studies of CBT for anxiety in children and young people published between 1970 and July 2012. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include children and young people with a clear diagnosis of anxiety. Forty‐one studies with a total of 1806 participants were included in the review. The review authors rated the overall quality of the studies as 'moderate'. What does the evidence from the review tell us? CBT is significantly more effective than no therapy in reducing symptoms of anxiety in children and young people. No clear evidence indicates that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, individually, with parents). CBT is no more effective than other 'active therapies' such as self‐help books. The small number of studies meant the review authors could not compare CBT with medication. Only four studies looked at longer‐term outcomes after CBT. No clear evidence showed maintained improvement in symptoms of anxiety among children and young people. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that future research should look in greater detail at what makes CBT work best for children and young people, how CBT can be provided in the most cost‐effective way, and how CBT can be adapted for different age groups.

AB: Abstract - Background Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' antipsychotics. As well as its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders than the older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms. Objectives To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs. Search methods The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980‐1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980‐1997), MEDLINE (1966‐1997), PsycLIT (1974‐1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted. Selection criteria All randomised trials comparing risperidone to any 'conventional' neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on dose of risperidone, haloperidol and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement, side effects (movement disorders) and acceptability of treatment. For homogeneous dichotomous data the Relative Risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Main results In the short‐term, risperidone was more likely to produce an improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) when compared with haloperidol (n=2368, 9 RCTs, RR not 20% improved 0.72 CI 0.59 to 0.88 NNT 8). A similar, favourable outcome for risperidone was found in long‐term studies (n=859, 2RCTs RR not 20% improved 0.51 CI 0.38 to 0.67 NNT 4;n=675 1RCT, RR not improved 40% 0.75 CI 0.66 to 0.84 NNT 5; n=675, 1 RCT, RR not 60% improved 0.90 CI 0.84 to 0.96, NNT 11). Risperidone was also more likely to reduce relapse at one year follow up, compared with haloperidol (n=367, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.41 to 0.99, NNT 7). Less people allocated risperidone left studies before completion, both for short‐term (n=3066, 16 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.63 to 0.92, NNT 6) and long‐term trials (n=1270, 4RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.42 to 0.73 NNT 4). For general movement disorders results favoured risperidone. People given risperidone had significantly fewer general movement disorders (including extrapyramidal side effects) than those receiving older typical antipsychotics (n=2702, 10 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.56 to 0.71, NNT 3). Significantly fewer people given risperidone used antiparkinsonian drugs (n=2524, 11 RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.58 to 0.74, NNT 4). As regards body weight, however, four studies (n=1708) found people were more likely to gain weight if allocated risperidone compared to typical antipsychotics (RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNH 3). Risperidone was no more or less likely than haloperidol to cause sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction (n=106, 2 RCTs, RR 1.55 CI 0.58 to 4.20). Finally, some results found risperidone was more likely to cause rhinitis than conventional antipsychotics (n=656, 3 RCTs, RR1.99 CI 1.24 to 3.19, NNH 3). Authors' conclusions Risperidone may be more acceptable to those with schizophrenia than older antipsychotics and have marginal benefits in terms of limited clinical improvement. Its adverse effect profile may be better than haloperidol. With the addition of more studies to this review, the publication bias evident in previous versions is no longer a significant issue. Any marginal benefits this drug may have have to be balanced against its greater cost and increased tendency to cause side effects such as weight gain. Recent important longer term data favouring risperidone's effect on relapse needs to be replicated by researchers independently of the manufacturers of the drug. Plain language summary Risperidone versus typical antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia Risperidone is one of the most widely used new generation of antipsychotic drugs. This review summarises its effects compared with the older antipsychotics. In essence, risperidone may be equally clinically effective to relatively high doses of haloperidol, for an outcome that is difficult to interpret as clinically meaningful. Risperidone causes less adverse effects than the side‐effect prone haloperidol.

AB: Abstract - Background Haloperidol used alone is recommended to help calm situations of aggression or agitation for people with psychosis. It is widely accessible and may be the only antipsychotic medication available in limited‐resource areas. Objectives To examine whether haloperidol alone is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation, wherein clinicians are required to intervene to prevent harm to self and others. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (26th May 2016). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people exhibiting aggression and/or agitation thought to be due to psychosis, allocated rapid use of haloperidol alone (by any route), compared with any other treatment. Outcomes of interest included tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes, repeated need for rapid tranquillisation within 24 hours, specific behaviours (threat or injury to others/self), adverse effects. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and providing useable data. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), and for cognitive outcomes we derived standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and using a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce 'Summary of findings' tables which included our pre‐specified main outcomes of interest. Main results We found nine new RCTs from the 2016 update search, giving a total of 41 included studies and 24 comparisons. Few studies were undertaken in circumstances that reflect real‐world practice, and, with notable exceptions, most were small and carried considerable risk of bias. Due to the large number of comparisons, we can only present a summary of main results. Compared with placebo, more people in the haloperidol group were asleep at two hours (2 RCTs, n=220, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.82 to 0.95, very low‐quality evidence) and experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n=207, RR 7.49, 95%CI 0.93 to 60.21, very low‐quality evidence). Compared with aripiprazole, people in the haloperidol group required fewer injections than those in the aripiprazole group (2 RCTs, n=473, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.62 to 0.99, low‐quality evidence). More people in the haloperidol group experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n=477, RR 6.63, 95%CI 1.52 to 28.86, very low‐quality evidence). Four trials (n=207) compared haloperidol with lorazepam with no significant differences with regard to number of participants asleep at one hour (1 RCT, n=60, RR 1.05, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.44, very low‐quality of evidence) or those requiring additional injections (1 RCT, n=66, RR 1.14, 95%CI 0.91 to 1.43, very low‐quality of evidence). Haloperidol's adverse effects were not offset by addition of lorazepam (e.g. dystonia 1 RCT, n=67, RR 8.25, 95%CI 0.46 to 147.45, very low‐quality of evidence). Addition of promethazine was investigated in two trials (n=376). More people in the haloperidol group were not tranquil or asleep by 20 minutes (1 RCT, n=316, RR 1.60, 95%CI 1.18 to 2.16, moderate‐quality evidence). Acute dystonia was too common in the haloperidol alone group for the trial to continue beyond the interim analysis (1 RCT, n=316, RR 19.48, 95%CI 1.14 to 331.92, low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Additional data from new studies does not alter previous conclusions of this review. If no other alternative exists, sole use of intramuscular haloperidol could be life‐saving. Where additional drugs are available, sole use of haloperidol for extreme emergency could be considered unethical. Addition of the sedating promethazine has support from better‐grade evidence from within randomised trials. Use of an alternative antipsychotic drug is only partially supported by fragmented and poor‐grade evidence. Adding a benzodiazepine to haloperidol does not have strong evidence of benefit and carries risk of additional harm. After six decades of use for emergency rapid tranquillisation, this is still an area in need of good independent trials relevant to real‐world practice. Plain language summary Haloperidol as a means of calming people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis Aim of review This review looks at whether haloperidol is effective for treating people who are agitated and aggressive as a result of having psychosis. Background People with psychosis may experience hearing voices (hallucinations) or abnormal thoughts (delusions), which can make the person frightened, distressed and agitated (restless, excitable or irritable), leading sometimes to aggressive behaviour. This poses a significant challenge for mental health professionals, who have to quickly choose the best available treatment to prevent the risk of harm to both patient and/or others. Haloperidol is a medication used for treating people with psychosis that can be taken by mouth or injected. As well as being an antipsychotic (preventing psychosis), it also calms people down or helps them to sleep. Searches In 2011 and 2016, the information specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialised register for randomised trials that looked at the effects of giving haloperidol compared with either placebo or other treatments to people who are aggressive or agitated because they were experiencing psychosis. Results Forty‐one studies are now included in the review but information in these is of low‐quality. Main results show that when compared with placebo or no treatment, more people having haloperidol were asleep after two hours. However, evidence is not strong. Results are made more complex by large variety of available treatments (24 comparisons). Conclusions The review authors conclude there is weak evidence that haloperidol calms people down and helps manage difficult situations. However, this is not based on good‐quality trails and therefore health professionals and people with mental health problems are left without clear evidence‐based guidance. In some situations, haloperidol may be the only choice, but this is far from ideal because although haloperidol is effective at calming people down it has side effects (e.g. restlessness, shaking of the head, hands and body, heart problems). These side effects can be just as distressing as psychosis and may act as a barrier that stops people coming back for future treatment. More research is needed to help people consider and understand which medication is better at calming people down; has fewer side effects; works quickly and rapidly; and can be used at lower dosages (or less frequent injections). This plain language summary is based on a summary written by a consumer Ben Gray from Rethink.

AB: Abstract - Background Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury) is common, often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self‐harm. Objectives To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. Data collection and analysis We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. Main results We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive‐behavioural‐based psychotherapy (CBT‐based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive‐behavioural, problem‐solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion‐regulation group‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality. There was a significant treatment effect for CBT‐based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow‐up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.26; k  =  6; N  =  594; GRADE: low quality). For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow‐up (MD ‐18.82, 95% CI ‐36.68 to ‐0.95; k  =  3; N  =  292; GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT‐oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow‐up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k  =  1; N  =  97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k  =  1; N  = 18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH. Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k  =  1; N  =  136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k  =  1; N  =  391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact‐based interventions) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k  =  4; N  =  3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k  =  2; N  =  1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N  =  840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone‐based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero cell counts; GRADE: low quality). None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of psychological therapy: interpersonal problem‐solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home‐based problem‐solving therapy, long‐term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment. We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported. Authors' conclusions CBT‐based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for self‐harm in adults Why is this review important? Self harm (SH), which includes non‐fatal intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is linked to risk of future suicide. It is distressing for both patients and their families and friends, and places large demands on clinical services. It is therefore important to assess the evidence on treatments for SH patients. Who will be interested in this review? Clinicians working with people who engage in SH, policy makers, people who themselves have engaged in SH or may be at risk of doing so, and their families and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999, which found little evidence of beneficial effects of psychosocial treatments on repetition of SH. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial treatments for patients with SH with a broader range of outcomes. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for adults who had recently engaged in SH. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 29 April 2015, and found 55 that met our inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have now been a number of investigations of psychosocial treatments for SH in adults, with greater representation in recent years of low‐ and middle‐income countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Some moderate quality evidence shows that cognitive‐behavioural‐based (CBT‐based) psychotherapy (a psychotherapy intended to change unhelpful thinking, emotions and behaviour) may help prevent repetition of SH, although it did not reduce overall frequency of SH. There were encouraging results (from small trials of moderate to very low quality) for other interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of SH in people with probable personality disorder, including group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy, mentalisation (a psychosocial therapy intended to increase a person’s understanding of their own and others' mental state), and dialectical behaviour therapies (DBT; psychosocial therapies intended to assist with identification of triggers that lead to reactive behaviours and to provide individuals with emotional coping skills to avoid these reactions). Whilst DBT was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at final follow‐up as compared to usual treatment, there was evidence of low quality suggesting a reduction in frequency of SH. There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of prolonged exposure to DBT, case management, approaches to improve treatment adherence, mixed multimodal interventions (comprising both psychological therapy and remote contact‐based interventions), remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, and telephone contact), interpersonal problem‐solving skills training, behaviour therapy, provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, home‐based problem‐solving therapy, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, intensive outpatient treatment, or long‐term psychotherapy. We had only limited evidence from a subset of the studies relating to whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. The trials did not report on side effects other than suicidal behaviour. What should happen next? The promising results for CBT‐based psychological therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation to understand which patients benefit from these types of interventions. There were only a few, generally small trials on most other types of psychosocial therapies, providing little evidence of beneficial effects; however, these cannot be ruled out. There is a need for more information about whether psychosocial interventions might work differently between men and women.

AB: Abstract - Background Virtual reality (VR) is computerised real‐time technology, which can be used an alternative assessment and treatment tool in the mental health field. Virtual reality may take different forms to simulate real‐life activities and support treatment. Objectives To investigate the effects of virtual reality to support treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (most recent, 17th September 2013) and relevant reference lists. Selection criteria All relevant randomised studies comparing virtual reality with standard care for those with serious mental illnesses. We defined virtual reality as a computerised real‐time technology using graphics, sound and other sensory input, which creates the interactive computer‐mediated world as a therapeutic tool. Data collection and analysis All review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data the risk difference (RD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified three short‐term trials (total of 156 participants, duration five to 12 weeks). Outcomes were prone to at least a moderate risk of overestimating positive effects. We found that virtual reality had little effects regarding compliance (3 RCTs, n = 156, RD loss to follow‐up 0.02 CI ‐0.08 to 0.12,  low quality evidence ), cognitive functioning (1 RCT, n = 27, MD average score on Cognistat 4.67 CI ‐1.76 to 11.10,  low quality evidence ), social skills (1 RCT, n = 64, MD average score on social problem solving SPSI‐R (Social Problem Solving Inventory ‐ Revised) ‐2.30 CI ‐8.13 to 3.53,  low quality evidence ), or acceptability of intervention (2 RCTs, n = 92, RD 0.05 CI ‐0.09 to 0.19,  low quality evidence ). There were no data reported on mental state, insight, behaviour, quality of life, costs, service utilisation, or adverse effects. Satisfaction with treatment ‐ measured using an un‐referenced scale ‐ and reported as "interest in training" was better for the virtual reality group (1 RCT, n = 64, MD 6.00 CI 1.39 to 10.61, low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions There is no clear good quality evidence for or against using virtual reality for treatment compliance among people with serious mental illness. If virtual reality is used, the experimental nature of the intervention should be clearly explained. High‐quality studies should be undertaken in this area to explore any effects of this novel intervention and variations of approach. Plain language summary Virtual reality needs to be explored to show its effects for treatment of schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often have problems in their processes of thinking and understanding, resulting in poor insight into their illness and poor organisational skills. These factors along with experiencing unpleasant side effects of medication can contribute to people with mental health problems often not taking their medication, unwilling to follow treatment and non‐attendance at appointments. This can sometimes lead to a loss of contact with the mental health team and relapse. Virtual reality (VR) is a modern, experimental, computerised and real‐time technology that uses visual graphics, sounds and other sensory input which creates an interactive computer world. It includes, for example, the use of sensors attached to the hands and fingers allowing virtual reality users to track their position and movement. Virtual reality creates a computerised environment that simulates real life and everyday activities.This could help people learn in a safe and friendly environment to improve their decisions and attitudes about treatment, so encouraging people to take or comply with their medication.   So far, virtual reality has been used in the assessment and treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders and social anxieties, some of which include, fear of flying, public speaking anxiety, spider phobia, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. There are also a few studies that examine the emotional responses of people with schizophrenia during a computer simulation with characters displaying happy, neutral, and angry emotions. Virtual reality has also been used for people with schizophrenia in social skills training and to improve processes of thinking and understanding. This review investigates the effects of virtual reality in helping support the treatment and taking of medication for people with serious mental illness.  The most recent search for randomised trials was run in September 2013, only three short studies with a total of 156 people could be included. People with schizophrenia were randomised to a) skills training sessions that used virtual reality to deliver the training or b) sessions of skills training using other methods to deliver the training or c) standard care. All evidence from the trials was low quality and no real effects were found. At present, there is no clear evidence for or against using virtual reality for encouraging people with mental illness to take their medication. If virtual reality is used for people with serious mental illness, it will be of an experimental nature.There is a need to gather more good quality information on the effects of virtual reality for people with mental illness and high quality studies need to be undertaken. At this stage, the effects of virtual reality are experimental, novel and innovative but largely untested. This summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray of RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background People experiencing psychosis may become aggressive. Antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole in intramuscular form, can be used in such situations. Objectives To evaluate the effects of intramuscular aripiprazole in the treatment of psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation (rapid tranquillisation). Search methods On 11 December 2014 and 11 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that randomised people with psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation to receive either intramuscular aripiprazole or another intramuscular intervention. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed these. We included studies that met our selection criteria. At least two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We chose a fixed‐effect model. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results Searching found 63 records referring to 21 possible trials. We could only include three studies, all completed over the last decade, with 885 participants, of which 707 were included for quantitative analyses in this systematic review. Due to limited comparisons, small size of trials and a paucity of investigated and reported 'pragmatic' outcomes, evidence was mostly graded as low or very low quality. No trials reported useful data for one of our primary outcomes of tranquil or asleep by 30 minutes. Economic outcomes were also not reported in the trials. When compared with placebo, fewer people in the aripiprazole group needed additional injections compared to the placebo group (2 RCTs, n = 382, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85,  very low‐quality evidence ). Clinically important improvement in agitation at two hours favoured the aripiprazole group (2 RCTs, n = 382, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92,  very low‐quality evidence ). The numbers of non‐responders after the first injection also favoured aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 263, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.71,  low‐quality evidence ). Although no effect was found, more people in the aripiprazole compared to the placebo group experienced adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 117, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). Aripiprazole required more injections compared to haloperidol (2 RCTs, n = 477, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63,  very low‐quality evidence ), with no significant difference in agitation (2 RCTs, n = 477, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11,  very low‐quality evidence ), and similar non‐responders after first injection (1 RCT, n = 360, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.79,  low‐quality evidence ). Aripiprazole and haloperidol did not differ when taking into account the overall number of people that experienced at least one adverse effect (1 RCT, n = 113, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.35,  very low‐quality evidence ). Compared to aripiprazole, olanzapine was better at reducing agitation (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99,  low‐quality evidence ) and had a more favourable effect on global state change scores (1 RCT, n = 80, MD 0.58, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.15,  low‐quality evidence ), both at two hours. No differences were found in terms of experiencing at least one adverse effect during the 24 hours after treatment (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.24,  very low‐quality evidence ). However, participants allocated to aripiprazole experienced less somnolence (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.82,  low‐quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions The available evidence is of poor quality but there is some evidence aripiprazole is effective compared to placebo and haloperidol, but not when compared to olanzapine. However, considering that evidence comes from only three studies, caution is required in generalising these results to real‐world practice. This review firmly highlights the need for more high‐quality trials on intramuscular aripiprazole in the management of people with acute aggression or agitation. Plain language summary How effective is aripiprazole for calming people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis? Background   People with psychosis may experience hearing voices (hallucinations) or abnormal thoughts (delusions) which can make them frightened, distressed and agitated (restless, excitable or irritable). Experiencing such emotions can sometimes result in behaviour that is aggressive or violent. This poses a challenge and dilemma for mental health professionals who have to diagnose and, often quickly, give the best available treatment to prevent those who are aggressive, harming themselves or others. Aripiprazole is a medication that can be used to treat psychosis and also calm people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. It can be taken by mouth or by injection (intramuscular). However, aripiprazole can also cause unpleasant side effects such as headaches, upset stomach, and excessive sleepiness or drowsiness. This review looks for evidence from randomised controlled trials that assesses the effectiveness of intramuscular aripiprazole for people who are agitated and aggressive as a result of having psychosis. Searching   The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group ran an electronic search in 2014 and in 2017 for studies randomising adults with aggression due to psychosis to receive either injections of aripiprazole or injections of a placebo (dummy treatment) or injections of another antipsychotic. The search found 63 relevant records, referring to 21 trials. Review authors screened these records for inclusion or exclusion. Main results   Only three studies could be included. Evidence is limited due to the small number of trials and poor quality of data reported. Fewer people receiving aripiprazole required more injections to become calm than those receiving placebo or haloperidol. Overall, aripiprazole caused a similar number of adverse effects to placebo or haloperidol. Compared to olanzapine, aripiprazole was less effective at calming people but caused less sleepiness or drowsiness Conclusions   Some evidence is available, but is of poor quality, and it is difficult to make conclusions about aripiprazole's effectiveness from such data. Health professionals and people with mental health problems are therefore left without clear guidance concerning use of aripiprazole as a rapid tranquilliser. More research is needed to help people consider which medication is better at calming people down, has fewer adverse effects, and works quickly and rapidly.

AB: Abstract - Background Recent US and UK clinical practice guidelines recommend that second‐generation antidepressants should be considered amongst the best first‐line options when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Systematic reviews have already highlighted some differences in efficacy between second‐generation antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) introduced in the market, is one of these antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with tricyclics, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and other conventional and non‐conventional antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to February 2012. No language restriction was applied. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to citalopram versus any other antidepressants. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), patient acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side‐effects). Main results Thirty‐seven trials compared citalopram with other antidepressants (such as tricyclics, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other antidepressants, either conventional ones, such as mirtazapine, venlafaxine and reboxetine, or non‐conventional, like  hypericum ). Citalopram was shown to be significantly less effective than escitalopram in achieving acute response (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.02), but more effective than paroxetine (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.96) and reboxetine (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91). Significantly fewer patients allocated to citalopram withdrew from trials due to adverse events compared with patients allocated to tricyclics (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and fewer patients allocated to citalopram reported at least one side effect than reboxetine or venlafaxine (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97 and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88, respectively). Authors' conclusions Some statistically significant differences between citalopram and other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. Citalopram was more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine and venlafaxine, however, it seemed to be less efficacious than escitalopram. As with most systematic reviews in psychopharmacology, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings. Economic analyses were not reported in the included studies, however, cost effectiveness information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Plain language summary Citalopram versus other antidepressants for depression Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate‐to‐severe major depression. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is the racemic mixture of S‐ and R‐enantiomer. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Thirty‐seven randomised controlled trials (more than 6000 participants) were included in the present review. In terms of efficacy, citalopram was more efficacious than other reference compounds like paroxetine or reboxetine, but worse than escitalopram. In terms of side effects, citalopram was more acceptable than older antidepressants, like tricyclics. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including differences in efficacy and side‐effect profiles.

AB: Abstract - Background People with depression often experience interpersonal problems. Family therapy for depression is a widely used intervention, but it is unclear whether this is an effective therapy for the treatment of depression. Objectives To assess the efficacy of family therapy for depression. Search methods The following electronic databases were searched using a specific search strategy: CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References searched on 21/10/2005, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1980 to January 2005), Psycinfo (1974 to January 2005). Reference lists of articles were also searched. Handsearches of relevant journals and bibliographies were conducted and first authors of included studies and experts in the field were contacted for further information. Selection criteria Included studies were randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials comparing family therapy with no intervention or an alternative intervention in which depression symptomatology was a main outcome measure. Data collection and analysis Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors using the Maastricht‐Amsterdam Criteria List. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the selected trials were independently extracted by three review authors using a standardised data extraction form. Levels of evidence were used to determine the strength of the evidence available. It was not possible to perform meta‐analyses because of the heterogeneity of the selected studies. Main results Three high‐quality and three low‐quality studies, involving 519 people with depression, were identified. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments. Despite fairly good methodological quality and positive findings of some studies, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression did not exceed level 3 (limited or conflicting evidence), except for moderate evidence (level 2), based on the non‐combined findings from three studies, indicating that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on decreasing depression, and on increasing family functioning. Authors' conclusions The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence‐base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. Further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required. Plain language summary Family therapy for depression This review looks at whether family therapy is an effective intervention in treating people of any age with depression. Family therapy for depression is widely used, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. The small number of randomised controlled trials included in the review were very heterogeneous, and therefore difficult to synthesise. Family therapy seems more effective than no treatment or being placed on a waiting list, but it remains unclear how effective this intervention is in comparison to other interventions. Further randomised controlled trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background The balance of evidence about whether psychosocial interventions for caregivers of people with dementia could reduce carers' psychological morbidity and delay their relatives' institutionalisation is now widely regarded as moderately positive ( Brodaty 2003 ;  Spijker 2008 ). Multi‐component, tailor‐made psychosocial interventions are considered to be particularly promising ( Brodaty 2003 ;  Spijker 2008 ). These interventions involve multiple mechanisms of action. In this review we focused solely on the effectiveness of one element within psychosocial interventions, cognitive reframing. Cognitive reframing is a component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) .  In dementia care, cognitive reframing interventions focus on family carers’ maladaptive, self‐defeating or distressing cognitions about their relatives’ behaviors and about their own performance in the caring role. Objectives The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive reframing interventions for family carers of people with dementia on their psychological morbidity and stress. Search methods The trials were identified by searching (5 April 2009) the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, which contains records from major healthcare databases:  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS, ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources. For more detailed information on what the Group's specialized register contains and to view the search strategies see the  Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group  methods used in reviews. The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources were also searched separately on 5 April 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of cognitive reframing interventions for family carers of people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Three assessors (MVD, ID, JmC) independently judged whether the intervention being studied was documented in a trial; two assessors assessed trial quality. Main results Pooled data indicated a beneficial effect of cognitive reframing interventions on carers' psychological morbidity, specifically anxiety (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.39 to ‐0.04), depression (SMD ‐0.66; 95% CI ‐1.27 to ‐0.05), and subjective stress (SMD ‐0.23; 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.04). No effects were found for carers’ coping, appraisal of the burden, reactions to their relatives’ behaviors, or institutionalization of the person with dementia. Authors' conclusions Cognitive reframing for family carers of people with dementia seems to reduce psychological morbidity and subjective stress but without altering appraisals of coping or burden. The results suggest that it may be an effective component of individualised, multi‐component interventions for carers. Identifying studies with relevant interventions was a challenge for this review. The impact of cognitive reframing might be higher when used alongside other interventions because this offers better opportunities to tailor cognitive reframing to actual everyday carer problems. Plain language summary Cognitive reframing for carers of people with dementia There is some evidence that cognitive reframing interventions for family carers of people with dementia are effective. Dementia care is challenging for family carers. We studied whether they could be helped by cognitive reframing interventions. Cognitive reframing is intended to reduce carers’ stress by changing certain of their beliefs, such as beliefs about their responsibilities to the person with dementia, their own need for support, and why their relatives behave as they do. We found that cognitive reframing has the potential to reduce anxiety, depression and stress. It did not affect carers’ coping or sense of being burdened. This review concludes that cognitive reframing might be useful to improve the mental health of informal carers of people with dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Anxiety disorders are common and disabling conditions, with a lifetime prevalence of 17% in the general population. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as second‐generation antipsychotics. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of second‐generation antipsychotics as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for people with anxiety disorders. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched up to 21 July 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials (RCTs) comparing second‐generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo, benzodiazepines, pregabalin or antidepressants. Participants were people with generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and specific phobias including social phobia. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes eleven RCTs with 4144 participants on three second‐generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone). Nine studies investigated the effects of second‐generation antipsychotics in generalised anxiety disorder, only two studies investigated the effects in social phobia. There were no studies on panic disorder or any other primary anxiety disorder. Seven studies investigated the effects of quetiapine. Participants with generalised anxiety disorder responded significantly better to quetiapine than to placebo (4 RCTs, N = 2265, OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.45). However, they were more likely to drop out due to adverse events, to gain weight, to suffer from sedation or to suffer from extrapyramidal side effects. When quetiapine was compared with antidepressants, there was no significant difference in efficacy‐related outcomes, but more participants in the quetiapine groups dropped out due to adverse events, gained weight and feeling sedated. Only two very small studies with a total of 36 participants examined olanzapine and found no difference in response to treatment. Two trials compared adjunctive treatment with risperidone with placebo and found no difference in response to treatment. Authors' conclusions We identified eligible trials on quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine. The available data on olanzapine and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions. Monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants. However, quetiapine's efficacy must be weighed against its lower tolerability. Plain language summary Second‐generation antipsychotic drugs for anxiety disorders  Anxiety disorders are a prevalent and disabling condition. Because of high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as second‐generation antipsychotics. This systematic review evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of second‐generation antipsychotics in the treatment of anxiety disorders. We found eleven randomised placebo‐controlled trials, comparing quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone with placebo and antidepressants. The vast majority of the available data was on quetiapine (> 3000 participants). Participants with generalised anxiety disorder responded significantly better to quetiapine than to placebo, measured as a reduction in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A). Participants treated with quetiapine were more likely to drop out due to adverse events, to gain weight, to suffer from sedation or to suffer from extrapyramidal side effects. The evidence on the other second‐generation antipsychotics is currently too limited to draw any conclusions.

AB: Abstract - Background Demographic changes are leading to an increase in the number of older drivers: as dementia is an age‐related disease, there is also an increase in the numbers of drivers with dementia. Dementia can impact on both the mobility and safety of drivers, and the impact of formal assessment of driving is unknown in terms of either mobility or safety. Those involved in assessment of older drivers need to be aware of the evidence of positive and negative effects of driving assessment. Cognitive tests are felt by some authors to have poor face and construct validity for assessing driving performance; extrapolating from values in one large‐scale prospective cohort study, the cognitive test that most strongly predicted future crashes would, if used as a screening tool, potentially prevent six crashes per 1000 people over 65 years of age screened, but at the price of stopping the driving of 121 people who would not have had a crash. Objectives Primary objectives:  1. to assess whether driving assessment facilitates continued driving in people with dementia;  2. to assess whether driving assessment reduces accidents in people with dementia. Secondary objective:  1. to assess the quality of research on assessment of drivers with dementia. Search methods ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia Group's Specialized Register was searched on 13 September 2012 using the terms: driving or driver* or "motor vehicle*" or "car accident*" or "traffic accident*" or automobile* or traffic. This register contains records from major healthcare databases, ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources and is updated regularly. Selection criteria We sought randomised controlled trials prospectively evaluating drivers with dementia for outcomes such as transport mobility, driving cessation or motor vehicle accidents following driving assessment. Data collection and analysis Each review author retrieved studies and assessed for primary and secondary outcomes, study design and study quality. Main results No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. A description and discussion of the driving literature relating to assessment of drivers with dementia relating to the primary objectives is presented. Authors' conclusions In an area with considerable public health impact for drivers with dementia and other road users, the available literature fails to demonstrate the benefit of driver assessment for either preserving transport mobility or reducing motor vehicle accidents. Driving legislation and recommendations from medical practitioners requires further research that addresses these outcomes in order to provide the best outcomes for both drivers with dementia and the general public. Plain language summary Driving assessment for maintaining mobility and safety in drivers with dementia The proportion of older people in the world is increasing and consequently the number of older drivers is also on the rise. Older people commonly depend upon private motor vehicles for their transport needs and so assessment of older drivers with cognitive impairment is becoming increasingly important. We have reviewed the literature on driving assessment in people with dementia for two reasons. First, we wished to see if assessment helped people with dementia and good driving skills continue driving. Second, we wished to discover whether assessment was useful in preventing road traffic accidents. Although many authors have studied the motor skills, neuropsychological performance and driving behaviour of drivers with dementia, we found no study that randomised drivers to evaluate these outcomes prospectively following assessment. This highlights the need for caution in applying the literature on driving assessment to clinical settings as no benefit has yet been prospectively demonstrated. It also indicates the need for prospective evaluation of new and existing models of driver assessment to best preserve transport mobility and minimise road traffic accidents.

AB: Abstract - Background Researchers have consistently found that people with schizophrenia score more poorly than others on a wide array of cognitive tasks and that these deficits persist even when the illness is in remission. The perceived impact of cognitive impairment on day‐to‐day functioning has led to the development of cognitive rehabilitation techniques intended to remedy these impairments, and thus improve the functioning of people with schizophrenia. Objectives To determine whether the use of cognitive rehabilitation techniques is associated with improvement in people with schizophrenia and related conditions. Search methods Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982‐1997), the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (2000), EMBASE (1980‐1997), LILACS (1982‐1997), MEDLINE (1966‐1997), PsycLIT (1974‐1997) and SCISEARCH (1997) were undertaken. References of all identified studies were handsearched and the first author of each included trial was contacted. Selection criteria The reviewers included randomised trials investigating the impact of cognitive rehabilitation on people with schizophrenia, or related conditions, compared to a placebo intervention, another intervention or standard treatment. This version of the review does not include comparisons of different types of cognitive rehabilitation. Data collection and analysis Relevant studies were identified and data extracted reliably by two reviewers working independently. In studies which did not specify the reasons for participants dropping out, we assumed that those who had dropped out had experienced no change in the outcome measures. Where possible, Peto odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Three small studies met the inclusion criteria. Two compared cognitive rehabilitation to a placebo intervention (total n=84), and the other to occupational therapy (n=33). Although cognitive rehabilitation was as acceptable as placebo and occupational therapy, with low attrition in both groups, no effects were demonstrated on measures of mental state, social behaviour, or cognitive functioning. An effect, in favour of cognitive rehabilitation, on a measure of self‐esteem (Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Scale, MD 6.3 CI 1.07‐11.53 ) is worthy of replication in any future trials. Authors' conclusions Data are inconclusive and provide no evidence for or against cognitive rehabilitation as a treatment for schizophrenia. Plain language summary Cognitive rehabilitation for people with schizophrenia and related conditions Synopsis pending.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second generation (atypical) antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether and, if so, how much the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. Objectives To evaluate the effects of sertindole compared with other second generation antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) and ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2009). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing oral sertindole with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone or zotepine for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes two short‐term low‐quality randomised trials (total n=508) both comparing sertindole with risperidone. One third of participants left the studies early (2 RCTs, n=504, RR 1.23 CI 0.94 to 1.60). There was no difference in efficacy (2 RCTs, n=493, WMD PANSS total change from baseline 1.98 CI ‐8.24 to 12.20). Compared with relatively high doses of risperidone (between 4 and 12 mg/day), sertindole produced significantly less akathisia and parkinsonism (1 RCT, n=321, RR 0.24 CI 0.09 to 0.69, NNT 14, CI 8 to 100). Sertindole produced more cardiac effects (2 RCTs, n=508, RR QTc prolongation 4.86 CI 1.94 to 12.18), weight change (2 RCTs, n=328, WMD 0.99 CI 0.12 to 1.86) and male sexual dysfunction (2 RCTs, n=437, RR 2.90 CI 1.32 to 6.35, NNH 13 CI 8 to 33). Authors' conclusions Sertindole may induce fewer movement disorders, but more cardiac effects, weight change and male sexual dysfunction than risperidone. However these data are based on only two studies and are too limited to allow firm conclusions. Nothing can be said about the effects of sertindole compared with second generation antipsychotics other than risperidone. There are several relevant trials underway or completed and about to report. Plain language summary Sertindole versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental health problem that can be long term and can severely disable some of the people who have it, especially in terms of quality of life and inclusion into wider society. The main treatment is medication (antipsychotics) and while some people find a drug which decreases their symptoms and does not give them a lot of adverse effects, there are others who are ‘treatment resistant’ i.e. none of the medication available works for them. There are some antipsychotics, such as clozapine and sertindole that can have quite dangerous side‐effects in some people. However, if they benefit people for whom nothing else works, the extra monitoring of these side‐effects that is needed, can perhaps be justified.  This review aims to compare sertindole to the other newer second generation (atypical) antipsychotics in people who have schizophrenia. Two studies were identified which included 508 people. Both compared sertindole to risperidone, were short (12 weeks) and the participants were either at least moderately ill or treatment resistant. There was no overall significant difference between these two medications in terms of improvement in people’s general well‐being or their mental state. Also while people on risperidone showed more movement side‐effects, those on sertindole were more likely to put on weight, have changes in their heart rhythm and the men were more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction.  The data from these trials are limited and a considerable number of the participants left the study early. In addition, sertindole has only been compared to one second generation antipsychotic and the trials are relatively short. A larger and longer trial comparing sertindole to other second generation antipsychotics, with the outcomes including mental state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life, would enhance our knowledge in this area considerably.

AB: Abstract - Background Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine the efficacy of yoga delivered as a package of care versus standard care. Objectives To examine the effects of yoga as a package of care versus standard care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PsychINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga as a package of care with standard‐care control. Data collection and analysis The review authors independently selected studies, quality rated these, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk difference (RD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its CI. We employed mixed‐effect and fixed‐effect models for analysis. We examined heterogeneity (I 2  technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results Three studies are included in this review. All outcomes were short term (less than eight weeks). Useable data were reported for two outcomes only; leaving the study early and quality of life. There was some evidence in favour of the yoga package for quality of life endpoint scores (1 RCT, n=80, MD 22.93 CI 19.74 to 26.12, low‐quality evidence). Leaving the study early data were equivocal between the treatment groups (3 RCTs, n=193, RD 0.06 CI ‐0.01 to 0.13, medium‐quality evidence, high heterogeneity). Overall, this review has an inordinate number of missing key outcomes, which included mental and global state, social functioning, physical health, adverse effects and costs of care. Authors' conclusions A small number of small studies were included in this review and these lacked many key outcomes. The sparse data means we cannot state with any degree of certainty if yoga delivered as a package of care is beneficial in comparison to standard care. Plain language summary Yoga as a package of care versus standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga, delivered as part of a larger package of care, effective for people with schizophrenia compared with standard care? Background Yoga involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise for reduction of stress and promotion of health and feelings of well‐being. Schizophrenia is a mental illness where people experience symptoms such as hearing voices that are not there, poor emotional response and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia often affects people for long periods of their life and is treated primarily by antipsychotic medications. However, these medications are not always fully effective and some research suggests that yoga as an add‐on treatment could be beneficial and help improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga can be combined with other therapies such as counselling or other forms of exercise into a 'package of care'. Study characteristics Only three short‐term studies (lasting eight weeks) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga as a package of care or standard care could be included in this review. Yoga was combined with drama, music and dance in one study, with a motivational and feedback session in another study. The final study included in this review combined yoga with counselling and an interactive question and answer session.The relative contribution of yoga was not clearly outlined in these studies. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register in March 2017. All participants continued to receive their prescribed antipsychotic treatment during their trial. Key results Many important outcomes were not addressed by the studies in this review, including mental, physical and social functioning, adverse effects and economic considerations. There may have been some small changes in quality of life in favour of the yoga package but overall there was not enough good‐quality evidence in this review to make any robust claims that yoga as a package of care should be prescribed as an add‐on to standard care for schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short‐term follow‐up for two outcomes were reported. Schizophrenia often is a long‐term illness and more, larger, and long‐term trials that focus on important outcomes are necessary.

AB: Abstract - Background Folate deficiency can result in congenital neural tube defects and megaloblastic anaemia. Low folate levels may be due to insufficient dietary intake or inefficient absorption, but impaired metabolic utilization also occurs. Because B12 deficiency can produce a similar anaemia to folate deficiency, there is a risk that folate supplementation can delay the diagnosis of B12 deficiency, which can cause irreversible neurological damage.  Folic acid supplements may sometimes therefore include vitamin B12 supplements with simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Lesser degrees of folate inadequacy are associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine which has been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplementation can improve cognitive function in the elderly. However, any apparent benefit from folic acid which was given in combination with B12 needs to be "corrected" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function has therefore been published. Objectives To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy or demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress. Search methods Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 10 October 2007 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin and cyanocobalamin. This Register contains references from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases. In addition MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and LILACS were searched (years 2003‐2007) for additional trials of folate with or without vitamin B12 on healthy elderly people. Selection criteria All double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated. Main results Eight randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials enrolled healthy older people, and four recruited participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Pooling the data was not possible owing to heterogeneity in sample selections, outcomes, trial duration, and dosage. Two studies involved a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12. There is no adequate evidence of benefit from folic acid supplemententation with or without vitamin B12 on cognitive function and mood of unselected healthy elderly people. However, in one trial enrolling a selected group of healthy elderly people with high homocysteine levels, 800 mcg/day folic acid supplementation over three years was associated with significant benefit in terms of global functioning (WMD 0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.096, P = 0.033); memory storage (WMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.24, P = 0.006) and information‐processing speed (WMD 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16, P = 0.016). Four trials involved people with cognitive impairment. In one pilot trial enrolling people with Alzheimer's disease, the overall response to cholinesterase inhibitors significantly improved with folic acid at a dose of 1mg/day (odds ratio: 4.06, 95% CI 1.22 to 13.53; P = 0.02) and there was a significant improvement in scores on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and the Social Behaviour subscale of the Nurse's Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (WMD 4.01, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.52, P = 0.02). Other trials involving people with cognitive impairment did not show any benefit in measures of cognitive function from folic acid, with or without vitamin B12. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing serum homocysteine concentrations (WMD ‐5.90, 95% CI ‐8.43 to ‐3.37, P < 0.00001). Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. Authors' conclusions The small number of studies which have been done provide no consistent evidence either way that folic acid, with or without vitamin B12, has a beneficial effect on cognitive function of unselected healthy or cognitively impaired older people. In a preliminary study, folic acid was associated with improvement in the response of people with Alzheimer's disease to cholinesterase inhibitors. In another, long‐term use appeared to improve the cognitive function of healthy older people with high homocysteine levels.  More studies are needed on this important issue. Plain language summary No evidence that folic acid with or without vitamin B12 improves cognitive function of unselected elderly people with or without dementia. Long‐term supplementation may benefit cognitive function of healthy older people with high homocysteine levels In the economically developed world, folate deficiency is one of the commonest vitamin deficiencies. Several reports suggest a higher prevalence of various psychiatric disorders in elderly people with folate deficiency. There is interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. Eight trials met the criteria for inclusion. It was not possible to pool the data because the trials studied different populations, tested folic acid in different doses, and used different outcome measures. There were two trials of folic acid in conjunction with B12. The analysis showed significant benefit of folic acid over placebo in some measures of cognition in a long‐term trial recruiting elderly people with high homocysteine levels from a general population. In one pilot trial, 1 mg/day of folic acid was associated with significant improvement in behavioural response to cholinesterase inhibitors in people with Alzheimer's disease.

AB: Abstract - Background Snoezelen, multi‐sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils. The rationale for this lies in the proposition that the provision of a sensory environment for people with dementia places fewer demands on their intellectual abilities but capitalizes on their residual sensorimotor abilities. The clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make the examination of the therapeutic values of snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions. Objectives To examine the clinical efficacy of snoezelen (or multisensory stimulation) for older people with dementia and their caregivers. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 23 March 2008 using the terms: snoezelen OR "multi‐sensory*". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. The reviewers hand‐searched PubMed and the ISI Web of Science. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials in which snoezelen or multi‐sensory programmes was used as an intervention for older people suffering from any forms of dementia. Data collection and analysis The two reviewers independently reviewed and assessed the quality of the trials. Main results Two new trials were included in this update. Baker 2003 was an expanded study of Baker 2001 reported in the previous version. Both Baker 2003 and van Weert 2005 examined the short‐term and longer‐term effects of snoezelen on behaviour, mood, and communication of people with moderate to severe dementia. The format of implementation was different in the two trials: one was session‐based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003), whilst the other was a 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005). Owing to the differences in study methodology, the results of the two trials were not pooled for analysis. The session‐based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003) did not show any effects on behaviour, mood, cognition and communication / interaction in the short term (during or immediately after sessions) or longer term (at post‐intervention or 1‐month post‐intervention follow‐up). Likewise, the 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005) failed to demonstrate any significant short‐term and longer term effects on behaviour, mood and interaction. Authors' conclusions A more vigorous review methodology was adopted in this update. The study of Kragt 1997, reported in the previous version, was excluded because the snoezelen programme only consisted of three sessions, which was considered too brief for a therapeutic intervention. Two new trials were reviewed. Meta‐analyses could not be performed because of the limited number of trials and different study methods of the available trials. Overall, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of snoezelen for dementia. There is a need for more reliable and sound research‐based evidence to inform and justify the use of snoezelen in dementia care. Plain language summary No evidence of the efficacy of snoezelen or multi‐sensory stimulation programmes for people with dementia Snoezelen (or multi‐sensory stimulation) has become a commonly used intervention to manage maladaptive behaviours and to promote positive mood of older people with dementia. Originally, two randomised clinical trials were available for this review. Some short‐term benefits were documented in promoting adaptive behaviours in people with dementia during and immediately after their participation in the sessions. In this update, two new trials were included and revealed two different forms of applying snoezelen to dementia care. One is a session‐based snoezelen programme while the other is a 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care programme. Both trials did not show any significant effects on behaviour, interaction, and mood of people with dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses musical interaction as a means of communication and expression. Within the area of serious mental disorders, the aim of the therapy is to help people improve their emotional and relational competencies, and address issues they may not be able to using words alone. Objectives To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, compared with placebo therapy, standard care or no treatment for people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Study‐Based Register (December 2010 and 15 January, 2015) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching of music therapy journals and manual searches of reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared music therapy with standard care, placebo therapy, or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. We excluded data where more than 30% of participants in any group were lost to follow‐up. We synthesised non‐skewed continuous endpoint data from valid scales using a standardised mean difference (SMD). We employed a fixed‐effect model for all analyses. If statistical heterogeneity was found, we examined treatment dosage (i.e. number of therapy sessions) and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity. Main results Ten new studies have been added to this update; 18 studies with a total 1215 participants are now included. These examined effects of music therapy over the short, medium, and long‐term, with treatment dosage varying from seven to 240 sessions. Overall, most information is from studies at low or unclear risk of bias A positive effect on global state was found for music therapy compared to standard care (medium term, 2 RCTs, n = 133, RR 0.38 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.59,  low‐quality evidence , number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 4). No binary data were available for other outcomes. Medium‐term continuous data identified good effects for music therapy on negative symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (3 RCTs, n = 177, SMD ‐ 0.55 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.24,  low‐quality evidence ) .  General mental state endpoint scores on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale were better for music therapy (2 RCTs, n = 159, SMD ‐0.97 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.63,  low‐quality evidence ), as were average endpoint scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (1 RCT, n = 70, SMD ‐1.25 95% CI ‐1.77 to ‐0.73,  moderate‐quality evidence ). Medium‐term average endpoint scores using the Global Assessment of Functioning showed no effect for music therapy on general functioning (2 RCTs, n = 118, SMD ‐0.19 CI ‐0.56 to 0.18,  moderate‐quality evidence ). However, positive effects for music therapy were found for both social functioning (Social Disability Screening Schedule scores; 2 RCTs, n = 160, SMD ‐0.72 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.40), and quality of life (General Well‐Being Schedule scores: 1 RCT, n = 72, SMD 1.82 95% CI 1.27 to 2.38,  moderate‐quality evidence ). There were no data available for adverse effects, service use, engagement with services, or cost. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the quality of the music therapy provided. Further research should especially address the long‐term effects of music therapy, dose‐response relationships, as well as the relevance of outcome measures in relation to music therapy. Plain language summary Music therapy for schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders Review Question What are the effects of providing music therapy or adding music therapy to treatment for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders? Background Characteristics of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like disorders are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions. People with schizophrenia often have two main types of symptoms: the acute symptoms of hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions), and chronic symptoms such as low mood/depression, social withdrawal, and memory problems. Music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses music experiences to help people with serious mental disorders improve their emotional and relational competencies and addresses issues that they may not be able to using words alone. Searching for evidence We ran electronic searches up to January 2015 for trials randomising people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders to receive music therapy or standard care. We found and checked 176 potential studies. Evidence found Eighteen trials with a total of 1215 participants met the review requirements and provided useful data. The evidence currently available is of low to moderate quality. The results of these studies suggest that music therapy improves global state and may also improve mental state, functioning, and quality of life if a sufficient number of music therapy sessions are provided. Conclusions Music therapy seems to help people with schizophrenia but further research is needed to confirm the positive effects found in this review. This research should especially address the long‐term effects of music therapy, the quality of music therapy provided and measure outcomes relevant to music therapy.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterised by delusions and hallucinations. Antipsychotic drugs does reduce these symptoms, but at least half of people given these drugs do not comply with the treatment regimen prescribed. Objectives To assess the effects of compliance therapy on antipsychotic medication adherence for people with schizophrenia. Search methods Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2005). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials of 'compliance therapy' for people with schizophrenia or related severe mental disorders. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and, for dichotomous data, calculated the relative risk (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention to treat basis. We present continuous data using the weighted mean difference statistic. Main results We included one trial with relevant and available data (n=56, duration 2 years) comparing compliance therapy with non‐specific counseling. The primary outcome 'non‐compliance with treatment' showed no significant difference between compliance therapy and non‐specific counseling (n=56, RR 1.23 CI 0.74 to 2.05). The compliance therapy did not substantially effect attitudes to treatment (n=50, WMD DAI score ‐2.10 CI ‐6.11 to 1.91). Very few people (˜10%) left the study by one year (n=56, RR 0.5 CI 0.1 to 2.51). Mental state seemed unaffected by the therapy (n=50, WMD PANSS score 6.1 CI ‐4.54 to 16.74) as was insight (n=50, WMD SAI ‐0.5 CI ‐2.43 to 1.43), global functioning (n=50, WMD GAF ‐4.20 CI ‐16.42 to 8.02) and quality of life (n=50, WMD QLS ‐3.40 CI ‐16.25 to 9.45). At both one and two years the average number of days in hospital was non‐significantly reduced for those allocated to the compliance therapy. Authors' conclusions There is no clear evidence to suggest that compliance therapy is beneficial for people with schizophrenia and related syndromes but more randomised studies are justified and needed in order for this intervention to be fully examined. Plain language summary Compliance therapy for schizophrenia Relapse in people with schizophrenia is common and in many cases attributable to poor compliance with antipsychotic medication. Compliance therapy was developed to specifically address non‐compliance with antipsychotic medication. We only found one reasonably good but small trial. It did not show that compliance therapy really effected compliance with medication, psychotic symptoms, or quality of life but it was always too small really to show this for certain. The study did, however, suggest that the compliance therapy may help people spend shorter times in hospital across a two year period, when compared with standard care. There is a need for more studies and we have proposed a design that could be conducted within the confines of routine care for outcomes of interest to everyone involved.

AB: Abstract - Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in people with Down Syndrome [DS]. Acetylcholine is a chemical found in the brain that has an important role in memory, attention, reason and language. Donepezil a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which is thought to maintain levels of acetylcholine, and is reported to have some benefits for people with AD in the general population. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of donepezil for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of donepezil as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with donepezil was administered compared with a placebo group. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the published reports of the one relevant study identified. Main results The one study included in this review is a small (n=30) randomised controlled trial lasting 24 weeks. It was followed‐up by an open label study with a crossover design. No significant differences were found on any four validated outcomes including global functioning and three measures of cognitive abilities and behavioural problems. 6 out of 16 carers (37%) of participants on donepezil and 2 out of 15 (13%) on placebo reported improvement. No data were available for day to day skills, institutionalisation, reduction in carers' stress or economic outcomes. Half the intervention group and 20% of the placebo group reported adverse events; two participants left because of adverse events. Authors' conclusions To date there is only one small randomised controlled study on the effect of donepezil. This shows, at best, a modest, non statistically significant trend in favour of people with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia who are able to tolerate donepezil (this drug is currently only dispensed in relatively large doses and is contraindicated for those with cardiac and respiratory problems).This study does not provide good evidence on which to base practice. Findings in an open‐label follow up to this study suggest possible benefit in some individuals. Further, larger randomised controlled studies with longer‐term follow up are required. Plain language summary Donepezil for dementia in people with Down Syndrome Donepezil is a drug which is thought to discourage the breakdown of acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is important to how memory functions. Acetylcholine is lacking in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The drug donepezil has been reported to have benefits for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who do not have Down syndrome. However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. This review identified one randomised controlled trial of donepezil in people with Down syndrome. This shows, at best, a modest, non statistically significant trend in favour of people with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia who are able to tolerate donepezil. The trial was of good quality, but small. It is important to note that people with Down syndrome may often have other conditions which mean that the drug is not suitable for all. Further research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Caring for someone with dementia can be emotionally and physically demanding. Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers. It is not clear what positive and negative effects such care may have on them, or on people with dementia. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of respite care for people with dementia and their caregivers, in particular the effect of respite care on rates of institutionalisation. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, using the terms respite* OR daycare OR caregiver* relief. ALOIS contains up‐to‐date records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing respite care with a control intervention for people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors carried out study selection independently and reached a consensus through discussion. Data were extracted by a single review author. The review authors contacted all investigators for methodological details not reported in the text and for additional data for three studies included in the previous version of the review. Main results Four trials are now included in the review, with 753 participants. They were different in many ways including the intervention, duration, outcomes and control group so pooling of data was not possible. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low. Re‐analysis of outcomes using data from the published studies found no significant effects of respite care compared to no respite care on any caregiver variable. When respite care was compared to polarity therapy a significant effect was found in favour of polarity therapy for caregiver perceived stress (n = 38, MD 5.80, 95% CI 1.43 to 10.17), but not for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes. No studies reported evaluable data on outcomes related to the people with dementia. Authors' conclusions Current evidence does not demonstrate any benefits or adverse effects from the use of respite care for people with dementia or their caregivers. These results should be treated with caution, however, as they may reflect the lack of high quality research in this area rather than an actual lack of benefit. Given the frequency with which respite care is advocated and provided, well‐designed trials are needed in this area. Plain language summary Respite care for people with dementia and their carers Review question This review aims to see whether respite care can reduce caregiver burden and stress, and increase the length of time for which a person with dementia can continue living at home. Background Caring for someone with dementia can be emotionally and physically demanding. Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers and it is not clear what positive and negative effects such care may have on them, or on people with dementia. Study characteristics Four studies with 753 participants were included in this review. Three compared respite care to no respite care and one compared respite care to polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy. All studies included people with dementia and their caregivers. We were not able to pool the results of the studies as there were so few studies and they measured the outcomes in different ways. All the studies reported outcomes for the caregiver, but only one reported outcomes for the person with dementia. Key results The three studies that compared respite care to no respite care found no evidence of any benefit of respite care for people with dementia or for their caregivers for any outcome, including rates of institutionalisation and caregiver burden. The study that compared respite care to polarity therapy found that polarity therapy decreased caregiver perceived stress but that there was no difference between polarity therapy and respite care for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes. Quality of the evidence A host of methodological problems were identified in the available trials. One study did not report data that could be analysed, the remaining three studies were very small and had a very short duration. Further methodologically sound research is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.

AB: Abstract - Background An advance directive is a document specifying a person's preferences for treatment, should he or she lose capacity to make such decisions in the future. They have been used in end‐of‐life settings to direct care but should be well suited to the mental health setting. Objectives To examine the effects of advance treatment directives for people with severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2008), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1 2008), BIOSIS (1985 to February 2008), CINAHL (1982 to February 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), PsycINFO (1872 to February 2008), as well as SCISEARCH and Google ‐ Internet search engine (February 2008). We inspected relevant references and contacted first authors of included studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving adults with severe mental illness, comparing any form of advance directive with standard care for health service and clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence interval again using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We were able to include two trials involving 321 people with severe mental illnesses. There was no significant difference in hospital admission (n=160, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 0.5 to 1.0), or number of psychiatric outpatient attendances between participants given advanced treatment directives or usual care. Similarly, no significant differences were found for compliance with treatment, self harm or number of arrests. Participants given advanced treatment directives needed less use of social workers time (n=160, 1 RCT, WMD ‐106.00 CI ‐156.2 to ‐55.8) than the usual care group, and violent acts were also lower in the advanced directives group (n=160, 1 RCT, RR 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 8 CI 6 to 92). The number of people leaving the study early were not different between groups (n=321, 2 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.6 to 1.6). The addition of 11 studies to awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Authors' conclusions There are too few data available to make definitive recommendations. More intensive forms of advance directive appear to show promise, but currently practice must be guided by evidence other than that derived from randomised trials. More trials are indicated to determine whether higher intensity interventions, such as joint crisis planning, have an effect on outcomes of clinical relevance. Plain language summary Advance treatment directives for people with severe mental illness An advance treatment directive is a document that specifies a person’s future preferences for treatment, should he or she lose the mental ability to make treatment decisions (lose capacity). They have traditionally been used to stipulate treatment in end‐of‐life situations. However, people with mental health problems can also have periods where they are unable to make treatment decisions, and an advance statement could help with choosing suitable medication, saying who should look after children and specifying choices in other areas of their life and treatment. This review looks at whether having an advance statement leads to less hospitalisation (either voluntary or involuntary), less contact with mental health services and whether there is an improvement in general functioning. Two studies were found, involving 321 people. Both took place in England. One trial involved the person concerned making a joint crisis plan in collaboration with the psychiatrist, care coordinator and project worker (high intensity), while the other required filling in a booklet called ‘preferences for care’ (low intensity). Both studies were compared to the usual care in the area concerned. Since the interventions were quite different, and not all outcomes were measured by both studies, it is quite difficult to compare the trials. Those who filled in the booklet showed no decrease in admission to hospital (voluntary or involuntary) or contact with out‐patient services, when compared to usual care. The high intensity group showed no differences in voluntary admissions compared to those in usual care, but were less likely to be hospitalised involuntarily, or assessed under the Mental Health Act. They were also less likely to be violent. There was no difference in use of psychiatric out‐patient services by those in the intervention groups. These are small studies and more research is needed, but it is suggested that using an advance treatment directive could be an alternative to community treatment orders.     (Plain language summary prepared for this review by Janey Antoniou of RETHINK, UK  www.rethink.org )

AB: Abstract - Background In view of the theoretical possibility of beneficial effects of DHEA retarding age‐associated deterioration in cognitive function, we have reviewed studies in this area. Objectives To establish whether administration of DHEA improves cognitive function or quality of life or reduces the rate of decline of cognitive function in normal older adults. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 18 March 2008 using the terms: dhea*, prasterone, dehydroepiandrosterone*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Relevant journals, personal communications and conference abstracts were searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of DHEA/S on cognition in older adults. Selection criteria All randomized placebo‐controlled trials enrolling people aged over 50 without dementia and to whom DHEA in any dosage was administered for more than one day were considered for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Data for the specified outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers (JGE and RM) and cross‐checked. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved. No data pooling was undertaken owing to the lack of availability of the relevant statistics. Main results Five studies provided results from adequate parallel‐group data. Barnhart 1999 and Dayal 2006 enrolled perimenopausal women with complaints of decreased well being and, using three cognitive measures, found no significant effect of DHEA compared with placebo at 3 months. Wolf 1998b enrolled 75 healthy volunteers (37 women and 38 men aged 59‐81) in a study of the effect of DHEA supplements on cognitive impairment induced by stress; after two weeks of treatment, placebo group performance deteriorated significantly on a test of selective attention following a psychosocial stressor (p<0.05), while deterioration was not evident in the DHEA group (p=0.85). However, when compared with placebo, DHEA was associated with significant impairment on a visual memory recall test (p<0.01) following the stressor. No significant effects were found on a third cognitive task. Effects were not found on tasks when administered in the absence of a stressor. van Niekerk 2001 found no effect on cognitive function in 46 men aged 62‐76 from three months of DHEA supplementation. Nair 2006, enrolled 57 women and 87 men with low level of sulphated DHEA in a 24‐month study, no significant changes in quality of life measures for either sex were found. In Von Muhlen 2008 DHEA for one year showed no benefit on cognition performance in 225 healthy older people. Reduced performance in a visual memory recall test observed in one trial and a significant drop‐out rate in favour of placebo emerged in another trial. Authors' conclusions What little evidence there is from controlled trials does not support a beneficial effect of DHEA supplementation on cognitive function of non‐demented middle‐aged or elderly people. There is inconsistent evidence from the controlled trials about adverse effects of DHEA. In view of growing public enthusiasm for DHEA supplementation, particularly in the USA, and the theoretical possibility of long‐term neuroprotective effects of DHEA there is a need for further high quality trials in which the duration of DHEA treatment is longer than one year, and the number of participants is large enough to provide adequate statistical power. Cognitive outcomes should be assessed in all trials. Plain language summary No current evidence for an improvement in memory or other aspects of cognitive function of non‐demented older people following DHEA supplements The adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphated ester (DHEAS) are together the most abundant of steroid hormones in both sexes. Blood levels are high in young adults and decrease with advancing age. There is some epidemiological evidence that relatively high serum DHEAS levels in males may protect against heart disease and be associated with increased longevity. In the USA there is growing public enthusiasm for DHEA supplementation as a means of retarding ageing and age‐associated cognitive impairment but there is very little evidence from controlled trials. In two trials DHEA was associated with a deleterious effect on visual memory after a psychosocial stressor and quality of life measures, but there is inconsistent systematic evidence of adverse effects from DHEA. Longer‐term randomized placebo controlled trials are needed for low and high doses.

AB: Abstract - Background Art therapy is defined by the British Association of Art Therapists as: “a form of psychotherapy that uses art media as its primary mode of communication. Clients who are referred to an art therapist need not have experience or skill in art. The art therapist is not primarily concerned with making an aesthetic or diagnostic assessment of the client’s image. The overall aim of its practitioners is to enable a client to change and grow on a personal level through the use of art materials in a safe and facilitating environment”. Historically, drawings and paintings have been recognised as a useful part of therapeutic processes within psychiatric and psychological specialties, and this has been acknowledged within medical and neurology‐based disciplines. Arts‐based therapies are generally considered as interventions managing manifestations of dementia, as they may help to slow cognitive deterioration, address symptoms related to psychosocially challenging behaviours and improve quality of life. Objectives To review the effects of art therapy as an adjunctive treatment for dementia compared with standard care and other non‐pharmacological interventions. Search methods We identified trials from ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register ‐ on 12 May 2014, 20 March 2015, 15 January 2016, 4 November 2016, and 4 October 2017. We also handsearched the grey literature and contacted specialists in the field and authors of relevant reviews or studies to enquire about other sources of relevant information. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials examining art therapy as an intervention for dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. We examined scales measuring cognition, affect and emotional well‐being, social functioning, behaviour and quality of life. Main results We found two studies that met the inclusion criteria, incorporating data on a total of 60 participants (from 88 randomised), in experimental groups (n = 29) and active control groups (n = 31). One study compared group art therapy with simple calculation activities over 12 weeks. The other study compared group art therapy with recreational activities over 40 weeks. It was not possible to pool the data for analysis from the included studies, due to heterogeneity in terms of differences in the interventions, control treatments and choice of outcome measures. In both studies there were no clear changes reported between the intervention group and the control group in the important outcome measures. According to GRADE ratings, we judged the quality of evidence for these outcome measures to be 'very low'. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence about the efficacy of art therapy for people with dementia. More adequately‐powered and high‐quality studies using relevant outcome measures are needed. Plain language summary Inconclusive findings on the effects of art therapy for people with dementia Title   Art therapy for people with dementia Background Dementia is a common condition that affects people’s memory. It can also affect people's thinking, emotions and behaviour. Dementia has a major impact on health and society across the world. Some types of treatment other than medication may help people with dementia. Art therapy is a type of psychological therapy, which means a treatment for problems of the mind and behaviour. Art can be used as a way to express and communicate thoughts and feelings. The aim of art therapists is to work with patients in ways that help them change and 'grow' on a personal level. This is done by using art materials in a safe environment that allows this process. Study Characteristics We looked at research trials of people with dementia doing art therapy, compared with usual care and other activities. We looked at effects of art therapy on memory and thinking, emotions, well‐being, social behaviour and quality of life. We also looked at negative effects and costs of art therapy. We found two research studies with a total of 88 older people taking part. There were results for 60 people. One study compared groups doing art therapy or simple calculation activities over 12 weeks. The other study compared groups doing art therapy or recreational activities over 40 weeks. The evidence is current to October 2017. Key Results These two studies found no clear changes in memory or most other outcomes looked at when comparing art therapy to other activities. Quality of the Evidence The studies were limited by many factors that reduced the quality of findings ‐ considered 'very low' with well‐known methods for evaluating this. Each study used different types of art therapy. This made it difficult to look at all the results together. One study had a high rate of people not completing the research trial. The studies included small numbers of people, which makes it difficult to be sure how accurate the findings are. This also makes it difficult to know if the effects will be the same in more people. Art therapy is difficult to test for its effects. More research is needed on this topic. There is not enough information from research trials about the effects of art therapy for people with dementia. This review suggests ways to do this.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a disabling serious mental illness that can be chronic. Haloperidol, one of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs, is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia but can have adverse side effects. The effects of stopping haloperidol in people with schizophrenia who are stable on their prescription are not well researched in the context of systematic reviews. Objectives To review the effects of haloperidol discontinuation in people with schizophrenia who are stable on haloperidol. Search methods On 20 February 2015, 24 May 2017, and 12 January 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials including trial registers. Selection criteria We included clinical trials randomising adults with schizophrenia or related disorders who were receiving haloperidol, and were stable. We included trials that randomised such participants to either continue their current treatment with haloperidol or discontinue their haloperidol treatment. We included trials that met our selection criteria and reported usable data. Data collection and analysis We independently checked all records retrieved from the search and obtained full reports of relevant records for closer inspection. We extracted data from included studies independently. All usable data were dichotomous, and we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias within the included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 232 participants comparing haloperidol discontinuation with haloperidol continuation. Discontinuation was achieved in all five studies by replacing haloperidol with placebo. The trials' size ranged between 23 and 87 participants. The methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were poorly reported. Participants allocated to discontinuing haloperidol treatment were more likely to show no improvement in global state compared with those in the haloperidol continuation group (n = 49; 1 RCT; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.20; very low quality evidence: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited due to relevant methodological shortcomings of included trials). Those who continued haloperidol treatment were less likely to experience a relapse compared to people who discontinued taking haloperidol (n = 165; 4 RCTs; RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.74; very low quality evidence). Satisfaction with treatment (measured as numbers leaving the study early) was similar between groups (n = 43; 1 RCT; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.28; very low quality evidence). No usable mental state, general functioning, general behaviour or adverse effect data were reported by any of the trials. Authors' conclusions This review provides limited evidence derived from small, short‐term studies. The longest study was for one year, making it difficult to generalise the results to a life‐long disorder. Very low quality evidence shows that discontinuation of haloperidol is associated with an increased risk of relapse and a reduction in the risk of 'global state improvement'. However, participant satisfaction with haloperidol treatment was not different from participant satisfaction with haloperidol discontinuation as measured by leaving the studies early. Due to the very low quality of these results, firm conclusions cannot be made. In addition, the available studies did not report usable data regarding the adverse effects of haloperidol treatment. Considering that haloperidol is one of the most widely used antipsychotic drugs, it was surprising that only a small number of studies into the benefit and harm of haloperidol discontinuation were available. Moreover, the available studies did not report on outcomes that are important to clinicians and to people with schizophrenia, particularly adverse effects and social outcomes. Better designed trials are warranted. Plain language summary What happens if haloperidol treatment is discontinued for people with schizophrenia Review question What are the effects of discontinuing the antipsychotic haloperidol in people with schizophrenia who are stable on haloperidol treatment. Background Schizophrenia involves a breakdown in the relationships between thought, emotion, and behaviour, leading to thought disorder, faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, and social withdrawal. Haloperidol is one of the first drugs to be used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Haloperidol is known to be effective for treating the psychotic symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) of schizophrenia; it can also, however, have unpleasant side effects. The effects of stopping or withdrawing haloperidol treatment are not well researched. Searching for evidence We ran electronic searches of Cochrane Schizophrenia's trial register, most recently on 24 January 2019, for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia and are stable on haloperidol treatment to either discontinue taking haloperidol or to continue taking haloperidol. The review authors found and checked 54 records. Evidence found Five trials met the review requirements and provided usable data. The evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials is of very low quality and suggests that haloperidol discontinuation is associated with poorer outcomes for people with schizophrenia in terms of their overall symptom improvement (global state). It also shows that people discontinuing haloperidol treatment are more likely to experience relapse (reoccurrence of symptoms) during the first year post treatment. There were no trials providing evidence on what happens after the first year. The number of participants leaving the study early (which can be an indication of satisfaction with treatment) was similar between the two treatments. The very low quality of the currently available evidence is due to methodological shortcomings of the included trials. This lowers our confidence in the reliability of results, and hampers their generalisability to real‐world situations. Conclusions It is disappointing that only a small number of studies were identified, and the size and quality of these studies were limited. The evidence available does not enable us to fully answer important questions regarding the effects of discontinuing haloperidol treatment. In particular there is no evidence available related to the side effects of haloperidol. New trials of better quality are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Informal carers of people with dementia can suffer from depressive symptoms, emotional distress and other physiological, social and financial consequences. Objectives This review focuses on three main objectives: To: 1) produce a quantitative review of the efficacy of telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia; 2) synthesize qualitative studies to explore carers’ experiences of receiving telephone counselling and counsellors’ experiences of conducting telephone counselling; and 3) integrate 1) and 2) to identify aspects of the intervention that are valued and work well, and those interventional components that should be improved or redesigned. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DIMDI databases, Springer database, Science direct and trial registers were searched on 3 May 2011 and updated on 25 February 2013. A Forward Citation search was conducted for included studies in Web of Science and Google Scholar. We used the Related Articles service of PubMed for included studies, contacted experts and hand‐searched abstracts of five congresses. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cross‐over trials that compared telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia against no treatment, usual care or friendly calls for chatting were included evaluation of efficacy. Qualitative studies with qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were also included to address experiences with telephone counselling. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the quantitative trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the qualitative studies with the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. The authors conducted meta‐analyses, but reported some results in narrative form due to clinical heterogeneity. The authors synthesised the qualitative data and integrated quantitative RCT data with the qualitative data. Main results Nine RCTs and two qualitative studies were included. Six studies investigated telephone counselling without additional intervention, one study combined telephone counselling with video sessions, and two studies combined it with video sessions and a workbook. All quantitative studies had a high risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about random sequence generation and allocation concealment. The quality of the qualitative studies ('thin descriptions') was assessed as moderate. Meta‐analyses indicated a reduction of depressive symptoms for telephone counselling without additional intervention (three trials, 163 participants: standardised mean different (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.63, P value 0.04; moderate quality evidence). The estimated effects on other outcomes (burden, distress, anxiety, quality of life, self‐efficacy, satisfaction and social support) were uncertain and differences could not be excluded (burden: four trials, 165 participants: SMD 0.45, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.90, P value 0.05; moderate quality evidence; support: two trials, 67 participants: SMD 0.25, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.73, P value 0.32; low quality evidence). None of the quantitative studies included reported adverse effects or harm due to telephone counselling. Three analytical themes (barriers and facilitators for successful implementation of telephone counselling, counsellor's emotional attitude and content of telephone counselling) and 16 descriptive themes that present the carers’ needs for telephone counselling were identified in the thematic synthesis. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data shows potential for improvement. For example, no RCT reported that the counsellor provided 24‐hour availability or that there was debriefing of the counsellor. Also, the qualitative studies covered a limited range of ways of performing telephone counselling. Authors' conclusions There is evidence that telephone counselling can reduce depressive symptoms for carers of people with dementia and that telephone counselling meets important needs of the carer. This result needs to be confirmed in future studies that evaluate efficacy through robust RCTs and the experience aspect through qualitative studies with rich data. Plain language summary Efficacy and experiences of telephone counselling for informal carers of people with dementia What is the problem? Caring for a person with dementia often has a negative impact on an informal carer’s mental and physical health and social life. Therefore, these informal carers should be offered support. They are usually family members and care for the person with dementia at home. What is telephone counselling? Eliciting a person’s concerns, listening, and providing support, information, or teaching in response to a persons’s stated concerns, over the telephone. The purpose of this review The aim of this review was to investigate whether telephone counselling is an effective way of reducing symptoms of depression and other stresses in the carers of people with dementia. We also investigated which aspects of telephone counselling the people who received it thought could be improved. Results of the review We searched for scientific studies that compared telephone counselling with no treatment, or usual care or friendly calls. We found nine studies that investigated how well telephone counselling worked (efficacy) and two studies that examined the quality of the experience. The efficacy studies investigated three types of telephone counselling: telephone counselling only (six studies); telephone counselling plus video sessions (one study); and telephone counselling plus video sessions and a workbook (two studies). These provided some evidence that telephone counselling is effective for reducing depressive symptoms in carers of people with dementia (three studies), but no clear positive effects could be shown for any other outcome such as stress or anxiety. The studies that investigated the experience aspect of telephone counselling revealed a range of carers’ needs (16 themes) that covered three main areas: barriers to ‐ and things that enabled ‐ successful implementation of telephone counselling; the counsellor’s emotional attitude; and the content of the telephone counselling. All studies were of moderate quality. Conclusions Analysis of both sets of results, i.e. efficacy compared with information about carers' experiences of telephone counselling, revealed needs that so far have not been met by telephone counselling. The studies that examined the experience aspect covered a very limited range of telephone counselling. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of included studies and their moderate quality.

AB: Abstract - Background Increasing evidence indicates that individuals who develop severe mental illness (SMI) are also vulnerable to developing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to increased risk of exposure to traumatic events and social adversity. The effectiveness of trauma‐focused psychological interventions (TFPIs) for PTSD in the general population is well‐established. TFPIs involve identifying and changing unhelpful beliefs about traumatic experiences, processing of traumatic memories, and developing new ways of responding to cues associated with trauma. Little is known about the potential feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of TFPIs for individuals who have a SMI and PTSD. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological interventions for PTSD symptoms or other symptoms of psychological distress arising from trauma in people with SMI. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Study‐Based Register (up until March 10, 2016), screened reference lists of relevant reports and reviews, and contacted trial authors for unpublished and/or specific outcome data. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated TFPIs for people with SMI and PTSD, and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis Three review authors (DS, MF, IN) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all references identified, and read short‐listed full text papers. We assessed risk of bias in each case. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data, on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We assessed quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and created 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results Four trials involving a total of 300 adults with SMI and PTSD are included. These trials evaluated three active intervention therapies: trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF‐CBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and brief psychoeducation for PTSD, all delivered via individual sessions. Our main outcomes of interest were PTSD symptoms, quality of life/well‐being, symptoms of co‐morbid psychosis, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, adverse events and health economic outcomes. 1. TF‐CBT versus usual care/waiting list Three trials provided data for this comparison, however, continuous outcome data available were more often found to be skewed than unskewed, leading to the necessity of conducting analyses separately for the two types of continuous data. Using the unskewed data only, results showed no significant differences between TF‐CBT and usual care in reducing clinician‐rated PTSD symptoms at short term (1 RCT, n =13, MD 13.15, 95% CI ‐4.09 to 30.39, low‐quality evidence ). Limited unskewed data showed equivocal results between groups in terms of general quality of life (1 RCT, n = 39, MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐4.47 to 3.27,  low‐quality evidence ), symptoms of psychosis (1 RCT, n = 9, MD ‐6.93, 95% CI ‐34.17 to 20.31,  low‐quality evidence ), and anxiety (1 RCT, n = 9, MD 12.57, 95% CI ‐5.54 to 30.68,  very low‐quality evidence ), at medium term. The only available data on depression symptoms were skewed and were equivocal across groups at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 48, MD 3.26, 95% CI ‐3.66 to 10.18,  very low‐quality evidence ). TF‐CBT was not associated with more adverse events (1 RCT, n = 100, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.31,  low‐quality evidence ) at medium term. No data were available for health economic outcomes. Very limited data for PTSD and other symptoms were available over the long term. 2. EMDR versus waiting list One trial provided data for this comparison. Favourable effects were found for EMDR in terms of PTSD symptom severity at medium term but data were skewed (1 RCT, n = 83, MD ‐12.31, 95% CI ‐22.72 to ‐1.90,  very low‐quality evidence).  EMDR was not associated with more adverse events (1 RCT, n = 102, RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.85,  low‐quality evidence ). No data were available for quality of life, symptoms of co‐morbid psychosis, depression, anxiety and health economics. 3.  TF‐CBT versus EMDR One trial compared TF‐CBT with EMDR. PTSD symptom severity, based on skewed data (1 RCT, n = 88, MD ‐1.69, 95% CI ‐12.63 to 9.23,  very low‐quality evidence ) was similar between treatment groups. No data were available for the other main outcomes. 4.  TF‐CBT versus psychoeducation One trial compared TF‐CBT with psychoeducation. Results were equivocal for PTSD symptom severity (1 RCT, n = 52, MD 0.23, 95% CI ‐14.66 to 15.12,  low‐quality evidence ) and general quality of life (1 RCT, n = 49, MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.74 to 0.95,  low‐quality evidence ) by medium term. No data were available for the other outcomes of interest. Authors' conclusions Very few trials have investigated TFPIs for individuals with SMI and PTSD. Results from trials of TF‐CBT are limited and inconclusive regarding its effectiveness on PTSD, or on psychotic symptoms or other symptoms of psychological distress. Only one trial evaluated EMDR and provided limited preliminary evidence favouring EMDR compared to waiting list. Comparing TF‐CBT head‐to‐head with EMDR and brief psychoeducation respectively, showed no clear effect for either therapy. Both TF‐CBT and EMDR do not appear to cause more (or less) adverse effects, compared to waiting list or usual care; these findings however, are mostly based on  low to very low‐quality  evidence. Further larger scale trials are now needed to provide high‐quality evidence to confirm or refute these preliminary findings, and to establish which intervention modalities and techniques are associated with improved outcomes, especially in the long term. Plain language summary Psychological interventions for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in people with severe mental illness Background Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically develops after a traumatic event is experienced or witnessed by an individual, or may develop when trauma is experienced by someone close to them. There is growing evidence that people with a severe mental illness (SMI) are vulnerable to developing PTSD due to increased risk of childhood and adulthood trauma. It is estimated that around a third of individuals with SMI also suffer from PTSD. A number of psychological interventions are available for the treatment of PTSD which are collectively known as 'trauma‐focused psychological interventions' (TFPIs). Searching for evidence We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trial's Register in January 2015 and March 2016 and found four relevant studies involving 300 adults diagnosed with both SMI and PTSD. The participants received treatments that included trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF‐CBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and brief psychoeducation. All of these therapies support individuals to work through and process the memories, emotions and behaviours associated with trauma. Key results When TF‐CBT was compared to the care usually received, no effect for reducing PTSD, psychotic, depressive or anxiety symptoms or improving quality of life, was noted. There was some low‐quality evidence from two studies that people with SMI and PTSD receiving TF‐CBT were more likely to recover from PTSD, that is, having PTSD symptoms which are below diagnostic threshold. TF‐CBT was not linked to an increase in side effects. A comparison of people receiving EMDR against those awaiting treatment showed a favourable effect for reducing the symptoms of PTSD (very low‐quality evidence). Again, there was no difference in side effects. No data were available for the effect of EMDR on quality of life, psychosis, depression or anxiety. A comparison of TF‐CBT with EMDR indicated no difference in reduction of PTSD symptom severity (very low‐quality evidence). Finally, when TF‐CBT was compared with brief psychoeducation there was no evidence that either therapy was superior in treating a range of PTSD symptoms. Quality of the evidence The review identifies limited, low‐quality evidence on TF‐CBT and EMDR. The effects of these treatments in reducing the symptoms of PTSD remain unclear although they do not appear to cause any more side effects than waiting for treatment. However, many important outcomes of interest have not been reported on and more research into the benefits of trauma‐focused psychological interventions for individuals with SMI and PTSD is required.

AB: Abstract - Background Long‐term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotic drugs has limitations: 25 to 33% of sufferers have illnesses that are treatment resistant. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer motor adverse effects than typical drugs for people with treatment‐resistant illnesses. Clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders, which necessitates mandatory weekly blood monitoring at least during the first months of treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effects of clozapine compared with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia. Search methods For the current update of this review (November 2008) we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a fixed‐effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed‐effect model. Main results We have included 52 trials (4746 participants) in this review. Forty‐four of the included studies are less than 13 weeks in duration, and, overall, trials were at a significant risk of bias. We found no significant difference in the effects of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs for broad outcomes such as mortality, ability to work or suitability for discharge at the end of the study. Clinical improvements were seen more frequently in those taking clozapine (n=1119, 14 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Also, participants given clozapine had fewer relapses than those on typical antipsychotic drugs (n=1303, RR 0.62 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 21 CI 15 to 49). BPRS scores showed a greater reduction of symptoms in clozapine‐treated participants, (n=1205, 17 RCTs, WMD ‐3.79 CI ‐4.9 to ‐2.7), although the data were heterogeneous ( I 2 =69%). Short‐term data from the SANS negative symptom scores favoured clozapine (n=196, 6 RCTs, WMD ‐7.21 CI ‐8.9 to ‐5.6). We found clozapine to be more acceptable in long‐term treatment than conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=982, 6 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 15 CI 12 to 20). Blood problems occurred more frequently in participants receiving clozapine (3.2%) compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs (0%) (n=1031, 13 RCTs, RR 7.09 CI 2.0 to 25.6). Clozapine participants experienced more drowsiness, hypersalivation or temperature increase, than those given conventional neuroleptics. However, those receiving clozapine experienced fewer motor adverse effects (n=1495, 19 RCTs, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6). The clinical effects of clozapine were more pronounced in participants resistant to typical neuroleptics in terms of clinical improvement (n=370, 4 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 3 to 6) and symptom reduction. Thirty‐four per cent of treatment‐resistant participants had a clinical improvement with clozapine treatment. Authors' conclusions Clozapine may be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, producing clinically meaningful improvements and postponing relapse, than typical antipsychotic drugs ‐ but data are weak and prone to bias. Participants were more satisfied with clozapine treatment than with typical neuroleptic treatment. The clinical effect of clozapine, however, is, at least in the short‐term, not reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The short‐term benefits of clozapine have to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age. The existing trials have largely neglected to assess the views of participants and their families on clozapine. More community‐based long‐term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of clozapine on global and social functioning as trials in special groups such as people with learning disabilities. Plain language summary Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia     Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. Schizophrenia is characterised by 'positive' symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and 'negative' symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. Half do have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. The overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable. Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical drugs. First generation or 'typical' antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms are fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with adverse effects which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse. People who do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication are sometimes given the 'atypical' antipsychotic drug clozapine, which has been found to be effective for some people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine is also associated with having fewer movement disorders than chlorpromazine, but may induce life‐threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis). We reviewed the affects of clozapine in people with schizophrenia compared with typical antipsychotic drugs drugs. This review supports the notion that clozapine is more effective than typical antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia in general, and for those who do not improve on typical antipsychotic drugs in particular. Clozapine is associated with less movement adverse effects than typical antipsychotic drugs, but it may cause serious blood‐related adverse effects. White blood cell count monitoring is mandatory for all people taking clozapine. There is a worry, however, that studies are ‐ at the very least ‐ moderately prone to bias favouring clozapine. Better conduct and reporting of trials could greatly have increased our confidence in the results.

AB: Abstract - Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in people with Down Syndrome (DS). Acetylcholine is a chemical found in the brain that has an important role in memory, attention, reason and language. Rivastigmine is a “pseudo‐irreversible” inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which is thought to maintain levels of acetylcholine. Rivastigmine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of rivastigmine as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered compared with a placebo group. Data collection and analysis No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review. Main results No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions As there are no included trials, recommendations cannot be made about rivastigmine for AD in DS. Well‐designed, adequately powered studies are required. Plain language summary Rivastigmine for dementia in people with Down syndrome The drug rivastigmine has been reported to have benefits for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who do not have Down syndrome. However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. This review identified no randomised controlled trials of rivastigmine in people with Down syndrome. Further research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a collective name for different degenerative brain syndromes which, according to Alzheimer's Disease International, affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide. The latest NICE guideline for dementia highlights the value of diverse treatment options for the different stages and symptoms of dementia including non‐pharmacological treatments. Relevant literature also argues for the value of interventions that acknowledge the complexity of the condition and address the person as a whole, including their physical, emotional, social and cognitive processes. At the same time, there is growing literature that highlights the capacity of the arts and embodied practices to address this complexity. Dance movement therapy is an embodied psychological intervention that can address complexity and thus, may be useful for people with dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of dance movement therapy on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms of people with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. Also, to compare different forms of dance movement therapy (e.g. Laban‐based dance movement therapy, Chacian dance movement therapy or Authentic Movement). Search methods Searches took place up to March 2016 through ALOIS, Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement’s Specialized Register, which covers CENTRAL, a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers, and grey literature sources. We checked bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, and contacted professional associations, educational programmes and experts from around the world. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, including cross‐over design and cluster‐RCTs for inclusion. Studies considered had to include people with dementia, in any age group and in any setting, with interventions delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted. Data collection and analysis The two review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality. Main results Of the 102 studies identified through electronic searches and personal communication, after de‐duplication we screened 80 at title/abstract level. We then reviewed 19 full papers, none of which met the inclusion criteria. Although three studies mentioned dance movement therapy as their intervention, they were excluded because they were not delivered by a qualified dance movement therapy practitioner. As a result, no studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia. Plain language summary Is dance movement therapy an effective intervention for dementia? A review of the evidence Why is this review important? Dementia currently affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide and there is an expectation that, as people are growing older, there will be a substantial increase in the number of people affected. Dementia literature argues for the need to address the complexity of the symptoms and work with the person as a whole. It is possible that dance movement therapy, an embodied psychological intervention that uses movement and dance to express and explore emotions, may be useful for people with dementia. However, its effectiveness remains unclear. This is the first review of the effectiveness of dance movement therapy for dementia and will add to the evidence base regarding available non‐pharmacological interventions for dementia. Who might be interested in this review? It is expected that this review will be of interest to people affected by dementia and their carers as well as general practitioners, mental health professionals and psychological therapists. What questions does this review aim to answer? We asked the following questions. Is dance movement therapy more effective than no treatment or standard care? Is dance movement therapy more effective than any other treatment? How effective are different types of dance movement therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of dance movement therapy for dementia up to March 2016, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity. No study met the inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was no evidence for or against dance movement therapy as a useful intervention for dementia. What should happen next? Well‐designed studies with a large number of participants and well‐defined interventions are needed before we are clear on whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia or not.

AB: Abstract - Background Approximately 20% of stroke patients experience clinically significant levels of anxiety at some point after stroke. Physicians can treat these patients with antidepressants or other anxiety‐reducing drugs, or both, or they can provide psychological therapy. This review looks at available evidence for these interventions. This is an update of the review first published in October 2011. Objectives The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical, psychological, complementary, or alternative therapeutic interventions in treating stroke patients with anxiety disorders or symptoms. The secondary objective was to identify whether any of these interventions for anxiety had an effect on quality of life, disability, depression, social participation, caregiver burden, or risk of death. Search methods We searched the trials register of the Cochrane Stroke Group (January 2017). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2017, Issue 1: searched January 2017); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017) in Ovid; Embase (1980 to January 2017) in Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1937 to January 2017) in EBSCO; and PsycINFO (1800 to January 2017) in Ovid. We conducted backward citation searches of reviews identified through database searches and forward citation searches of included studies. We contacted researchers known to be involved in related trials, and we searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials including participants with a diagnosis of both stroke and anxiety for which treatment was intended to reduce anxiety. Two review authors independently screened and selected titles and abstracts for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We performed a narrative review. We planned to do a meta‐analysis but were unable to do so as included studies were not sufficiently comparable. Main results We included three trials (four interventions) involving 196 participants with stroke and co‐morbid anxiety. One trial (described as a 'pilot study') randomised 21 community‐dwelling stroke survivors to four‐week use of a relaxation CD or to wait list control. This trial assessed anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported a reduction in anxiety at three months among participants who had used the relaxation CD (mean (standard deviation (SD) 6.9 (± 4.9) and 11.0 (± 3.9)), Cohen's d = 0.926, P value = 0.001; 19 participants analysed). The second trial randomised 81 participants with co‐morbid anxiety and depression to paroxetine, paroxetine plus psychotherapy, or standard care. Mean levels of anxiety severity scores based on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A) at follow‐up were 5.4 (SD ± 1.7), 3.8 (SD ± 1.8), and 12.8 (SD ± 1.9), respectively (P value < 0.01). The third trial randomised 94 stroke patients, also with co‐morbid anxiety and depression, to receive buspirone hydrochloride or standard care. At follow‐up, the mean levels of anxiety based on the HAM‐A were 6.5 (SD ± 3.1) and 12.6 (SD ± 3.4) in the two groups, respectively, which represents a significant difference (P value < 0.01). Half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced adverse events that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness; however, only 14% of those receiving buspirone experienced nausea or palpitations. Trial authors provided no information about the duration of symptoms associated with adverse events. The trial of relaxation therapy reported no adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low. Each study included a small number of participants, particularly the study of relaxation therapy. Studies of pharmacological agents presented details too limited to allow judgement of selection, performance, and detection bias and lack of placebo treatment in control groups. Although the study of relaxation therapy had allocated participants to treatment using an adequate method of randomisation, study recruitment methods might have introduced bias, and drop‐outs in the intervention group may have influenced results. Authors' conclusions Evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Further well‐conducted randomised controlled trials (using placebo or attention controls) are required to assess pharmacological agents and psychological therapies. Plain language summary Interventions for treating anxiety after stroke Review question To determine whether any treatments might reduce the symptoms of anxiety, and subsequently improve quality of life, for people who have had a stroke. Background Anxiety after stroke occurs frequently and can be treated with antidepressants or other anxiety‐reducing drugs, or both, or with psychological therapy. Study characteristics Evidence is current to January 2017. We found three studies with 196 stroke survivors who had received a diagnosis of anxiety. One study assessed the effect of a relaxation CD used five times a week for one month for participants with a diagnosis of anxiety. Two studies assessed the use of antidepressants in participants who had both anxiety and depression. Key results One study found that participants were less anxious three months after using a relaxation CD when compared with those who were given no therapy. One study reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant medicine (paroxetine), or with paroxetine and psychotherapy, than with standard care. This study reported that half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced side effects that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. The third study also reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant (buspirone hydrochloride) than with standard care, and only 14% of those receiving buspirone hydrocholoride reported nausea or palpitations. Quality of the evidence We judged that the quality of this evidence was very low. Studies were few and each included a small number of participants. Studies assessing antidepressants did not include comparison with a placebo drug, and information in both study reports was insufficient to permit assessment of whether other biases had been introduced. The study of relaxation therapy was very small, with loss of two participants who used the CD, and the study recruitment process may have attracted participants who had a positive bias towards psychological therapies. Conclusion Current evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Additional well‐conducted randomised trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer movement disorders. However, clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders. Newer atypical antipsychotics are safer alternatives that might share the benefits of clozapine. It is thus of interest to compare the effectiveness of newer atypical antipsychotics with the effectiveness of clozapine. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effects of newer atypical antipsychotic drugs in comparison to clozapine for schizophrenia. Search methods Publications in all languages were searched from the following databases: Biological Abstracts/BIOSIS (1980‐1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (1998), The Cochrane Library CENTRAL Register (Issue 4, 1999), EMBASE (1980‐1998), MEDLINE (1966‐1999), LILACS/CD‐ROM (1998), and PsycLIT/PsycINFO (1974‐1999). Trials were also sought from recent conference proceedings and reference lists of included papers. Authors of recent trials and the manufacturers of clozapine, iloperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, remoxipride, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone and zotepine were contacted. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical antipsychotic drugs were included by independent assessment by two reviewers. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogenous dichotomous data were calculated. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous dichotomous data. Where possible the number needed to treat (NNT) statistic with 95%CI were also calculated. Weighted or standardised means were calculated for continuous data. Due to the small number of included studies, sensitivity analyses or funnel plot statistics were not undertaken for this version of the review. Main results The current review includes eight studies (22 papers), of which three studies are 4‐6 weeks in duration and only one study is of more than 12 weeks' duration.     Newer atypical drugs seemed to be broadly similar to clozapine using a clinical global index or trialists' definitions of improvement, but this result was obtained from a relatively small number of studies. Due to the small number of studies and patients, wide confidence intervals were seen when their effectiveness as measured by symptom rating scales was compared. Social functioning was better in patients on newer atypical medication (risperidone) than in those on clozapine, but this finding is based on a single underpowered trial and has to be interpreted with caution. Clozapine and newer atypical drugs showed their adverse effect profile to be dissimilar: while clozapine produced more fatigue, hypersalivation, nausea, and orthostatic dizziness, new atypical drugs, with the exception of olanzapine, produced more extrapyramidal symptoms. The impact of these drugs and their effects on patients' day‐to‐day quality of life, service use, hospital admission, and pharmacoeconomics was not measured. Authors' conclusions The equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with clozapine is not yet demonstrated. Lack of statistical power to determine the comparative efficacy and effectiveness of newer atypical drugs makes it difficult to judge whether newer drugs are more effective, less effective or equivalent. Trials of sufficient power, with longer duration, measuring clinically important outcomes, are needed to assess the true comparative clinical effectiveness, tolerability and cost effectiveness of newer drugs in relation to clozapine. Plain language summary Newer atypical antipsychotic medication versus clozapine for schizophrenia Synopsis pending.

AB: Abstract - Background Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that was synthesised in 1960 and introduced as early as 1961 in the USA, but is still regularly used. It has also been frequently used as an active comparator in trials on newer antidepressants and can therefore be called a 'benchmark' antidepressant. However, its efficacy and safety compared to placebo in the treatment of major depression has not been assessed in a systematic review and meta‐analysis. Objectives To assess the effects of amitriptyline compared to placebo or no treatment for major depressive disorder in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) to August 2012. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened and manufacturers of amitriptyline contacted for details of additional studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amitriptyline with placebo or no treatment in patients with major depressive disorder as diagnosed by operationalised criteria. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used a random‐effects model throughout. Main results The review includes 39 trials with a total of 3509 participants. Study duration ranged between three and 12 weeks. Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving acute response (18 RCTs, n = 1987, OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.23). Significantly fewer participants allocated to amitriptyline than to placebo withdrew from trials due to inefficacy of treatment (19 RCTs, n = 2017, OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.28), but more amitriptyline‐treated participants withdrew due to side effects (19 RCTs, n = 2174, OR 4.15, 95% CI 2.71 to 6.35). Amitriptyline also caused more anticholinergic side effects, tachycardia, dizziness, nervousness, sedation, tremor, dyspepsia, sedation, sexual dysfunction and weight gain. In subgroup and meta‐regression analyses the results of the primary outcome were robust towards publication year (1971 to 1997), mean participant age at baseline, mean amitriptyline dose, study duration in weeks, pharmaceutical sponsor, inpatient versus outpatient setting and two‐arm versus three‐arm design. However, higher severity at baseline was associated with higher superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.02), while higher responder rates in the placebo groups were associated with lower superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.05). The results of the primary outcome were rather homogeneous, reflecting comparability of the trials. However, methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were usually poorly reported. Not all studies used intention‐to‐treat analyses and in many of them standard deviations were not reported and often had to be imputed. Funnel plots suggested a possible publication bias, but the trim and fill method did not change the overall effect size much (seven adjusted studies, OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.10). Authors' conclusions Amitriptyline is an efficacious antidepressant drug. It is, however, also associated with a number of side effects. Degree of placebo response and severity of depression at baseline may moderate drug‐placebo efficacy differences. Plain language summary Amitriptyline for the treatment of depression Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant drug that has been used for decades in the treatment of depression. The current review includes 39 trials with a total of 3509 participants and confirms its efficacy compared to placebo or no treatment. This finding is important, because the efficacy of antidepressants has recently been questioned. However, the review also demonstrated that amitriptyline produces a number of side effects such as vision problems, constipation and sedation. It is a limitation of this review that many studies have been poorly reported, which might have led to bias.

AB: Abstract - Background Jet lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day‐night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re‐align them with the outside world. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet lag after air travel across several time zones. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals 'Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine' and 'Sleep' by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in 'Side Effects of Drugs' (SED) and SED Annuals, 'Reactions Weekly', MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food & Drug Administration. An updating search was carried out on 12/2/2008 but no new studies were identified. Selection criteria Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet lag or related components, such as subjective well being, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms. Data collection and analysis Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment.   Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, 'Reactions Weekly', and in the WHO UMC database. Main results Eight of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet‐lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow‐release melatonin suggests that a short‐lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) is 2, based on the only two trials that gave the necessary data. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important: if it is taken at the wrong time, early in the day, it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local time. The incidence of other side effects is low. Case reports suggest that people with epilepsy, and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatonin. Authors' conclusions Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short‐term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2‐4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation.

AB: Abstract - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of chronic disability. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of disability in the under 40s, resulting in severe disability in some 150 to 200 million people per annum. In addition to mood and behavioural problems, cognition—particularly memory, attention and executive function—are commonly impaired by TBI. Cognitive problems following TBI are one of the most important factors in determining people's subjective well‐being and their quality of life. Drugs are widely used in an attempt to improve cognitive functions. Whilst cholinergic agents in TBI have been reviewed, there has not yet been a systematic review or meta‐analysis of the effect on chronic cognitive problems of all centrally acting pharmacological agents. Objectives To assess the effects of centrally acting pharmacological agents for treatment of chronic cognitive impairment subsequent to traumatic brain injury in adults. Search methods We searched ALOIS—the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register—on 16 November 2013, 23 February 2013, 20 January 2014, and 30 December 2014 using the terms: traumatic OR TBI OR "brain injury" OR "brain injuries" OR TBIs OR "axonal injury" OR "axonal injuries". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Supplementary searches were also performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO,  The Cochrane Library , CINAHL, LILACs, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal (ICTRP) and Web of Science with conference proceedings. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of any one centrally acting pharmacological agent that affects one or more of the main neurotransmitter systems in people with chronic traumatic brain injury; and there had to be a minimum of 12 months between the injury and entry into the trial. Data collection and analysis Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations obtained from the search. Relevant articles were retrieved for further assessment. A bibliographic search of relevant papers was conducted. We extracted data using a standardised tool, which included data on the incidence of adverse effects. Where necessary we requested additional unpublished data from study authors. Risk of bias was assessed by a single author. Main results Only four studies met the criteria for inclusion, with a total of 274 participants. Four pharmacological agents were investigated: modafinil (51 participants); (−)‐OSU6162, a monoamine stabiliser (12 participants of which six had a TBI); atomoxetine (60 participants); and rivastigmine (157 participants). A meta‐analysis could not be performed due to the small number and heterogeneity of the studies. All studies examined cognitive performance, with the majority of the psychometric sub‐tests showing no difference between treatment and placebo (n = 274, very low quality evidence). For (−)‐OSU6162 modest superiority over placebo was demonstrated on three measures, but markedly inferior performance on another. Rivastigmine was better than placebo on one primary measure, and a single cognitive outcome in a secondary analysis of a subgroup with more severe memory impairment at baseline. The study of modafinil assessed clinical global improvement (n = 51, low quality evidence), and did not find any difference between treatment and placebo. Safety, as measured by adverse events, was reported by all studies (n = 274, very low quality evidence), with significantly more nausea reported by participants who received rivastigmine compared to placebo. There were no other differences in safety between treatment and placebo. No studies reported any deaths. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine whether pharmacological treatment is effective in chronic cognitive impairment in TBI. Whilst there is a positive finding for rivastigmine on one primary measure, all other primary measures were not better than placebo. The positive findings for (−)‐OSU6162 are interpreted cautiously as the study was small (n = 6). For modafinil and atomoxetine no positive effects were found. All four drugs appear to be relatively well tolerated, although evidence is sparse. Plain language summary Drug treatments for chronic cognitive impairment in traumatic brain injury Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of long‐term disability across the world. The disability is often related to chronic cognitive impairment, such as changes to memory, attention and problem solving. Method: We reviewed randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of any of the drugs commonly used to treat cognitive impairment after TBI. We included only studies which started treatment at least 12 months after the injury; by this time the cognitive impairment is usually stable. Results: We identified only four trials for inclusion. These investigated four different drugs—modafinil; the experimental drug (−)‐OSU6162; atomoxetine; and rivastigmine—against placebo. On most measures there was no difference between treatment and placebo. Furthermore, the quality of the evidence was assessed as very low. The experimental drug called (−)‐OSU6162 was better than placebo on three cognitive measures, although this was a small study with only six participants with TBI. Modafinil, atomoxetine and rivastigmine were not found to be better than placebo. No difference between modafinil and placebo was found on assessment of clinical global improvement. Compared to placebo, more participants on modafinil and fewer on rivastigmine dropped out of the trials. More people taking modafinil, atomoxetine and rivastigmine experienced adverse effects than those on placebo, although the difference is most likely due to chance. Only nausea was statistically more likely in those taking rivastigmine. In the study of (−)‐OSU6162, one participant of three given placebo experienced adverse effects requiring a dose reduction, with no drop‐outs reported. No studies reported any deaths. Conclusion: Recommendations for, or against, drug treatment of chronic cognitive impairment in TBI cannot be made on the basis of current evidence.

AB: Abstract - Background People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. Objectives 1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual.  2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far:  (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment,  (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. Main results A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82,  very low quality of evidence ). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04,  very low quality evidence ). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89,  very low quality evidence ) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36,  very low quality evidence ) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17,  very low quality evidence ). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47,  very low quality evidence ). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. Authors' conclusions The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects. Plain language summary Supported employment for adults with severe mental illness People with mental health problems experience high rates of unemployment. There are various schemes delivering support to people with mental health problems who are trying to find employment. Supported employment tries to place people into competitive jobs. People are placed quickly in normal work settings where they receive intensive support and training from ‘job coaches’.    Individual placement and support (IPS) is a more specified scheme that includes: finding local jobs; a rapid job search; customer choice in what they want from the employment service; close working between employment and mental health teams; attention to people’s preferred job, their strengths and work experience; ongoing and, if necessary, long‐term individual support; and the benefits of counselling. Employment specialists act to identify people’s job interests, assist with job finding, give job support and engage other support services. IPS uses assertive outreach to deliver training, advice and vocational support in the community. Augmented supported employment is where employment support is given with other supplementary techniques, such as social skills training, motivational classes and various types of rehabilitation. Other approaches are many and varied, including: job workshops; job counselling; peer support; partnerships with business; and the Clubhouse model, which involves training, work experience, peer support and transitional employment and IPS because they do not search for immediate and competitive employment. However, all approaches involve periods of preparation, education and on‐the‐job training.    This review compares supported employment and IPS with other approaches for finding employment. Drawing from a total of 2259 people with mental health problems in 14 studies, the review has two main findings: 1) Supported employment increases the length and time of people’s employment; 2) People on supported employment find jobs quicker. Supported employment and IPS are better than other approaches in these two respects, but there is limited information or measurable differences on other important issues for service users.    For example, there is little information on issues such as improving quality of life, impact on people’s mental health, days in hospital and costs. Furthermore, the review built its main findings on limited statistical evidence drawn mainly from studies carried out in North America and Europe. Future studies should address a fuller range of information and outcomes. Longer studies are needed to see how long the effects of supported employment last.

AB: Abstract - Background So‐called 'third wave' cognitive and behavioural therapies represent a new generation of psychological therapies that are increasingly being used in the treatment of psychological problems. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of third‐wave cognitive and behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches as treatment for acute depression remain unclear. Objectives 1. To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo/psychological placebo control conditions for acute depression. 2. To examine the effects of different third wave CBT approaches (ACT, compassionate mind training, functional analytic psychotherapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, MBCT, extended behavioural activation and metacognitive therapy) compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo/psychological placebo control conditions for acute depression. 3. To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with different types of comparators (treatment as usual, no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo) for acute depression. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Specialised Register (CCDANCTR to 01/01/12), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from  The Cochrane Library  (all years), EMBASE, (1974‐), MEDLINE (1950‐) and PsycINFO (1967‐). We also searched CINAHL (May 2010) and PSYNDEX (June 2010) and reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews for additional published and unpublished studies. An updated search of CCDANCTR restricted to search terms relevant to third wave CBT therapies was conducted in March 2013 (CCDANCTR to 01/02/13). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared third wave CBT therapies with control conditions for acute depression in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information when required. We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results Four small studies (224 participants) were included in the review. Little information was provided about the process of allocating participants to groups. None of the studies used independent outcome assessors, and evidence suggested researcher allegiance towards the active treatments. The four studies examined a diversity of third wave CBT approaches (extended behavioural activation, acceptance and commitment therapy and competitive memory training) and control conditions. None of the studies conducted follow‐up assessments. The results showed a significant difference in clinical response rates in favour of third wave CBT when compared with treatment as usual (TAU) conditions (three studies, 170 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.95; very low quality). No significant difference in treatment acceptability based on dropout rates was found between third wave CBT approaches and TAU (four studies, 224 participants, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.08 to 12.30; very low quality). Both analyses showed substantial statistical heterogeneity. Authors' conclusions Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT approaches appear to be more effective than treatment as usual in the treatment of acute depression. The very small number of available studies and the diverse types of interventions and control comparators, together with methodological limitations, limit the ability to draw any conclusions on their effect in the short term or over a longer term. The increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice underscores the importance of completing further studies of third wave CBT approaches in the treatment of acute depression, on a short‐ and long‐term basis, to provide evidence of their effectiveness to policy‐makers, clinicians and users of services. Plain language summary 'Third wave' cognitive and behavioural therapies versus treatment as usual for depression Major depression is a very common condition in which people experience a persistently low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death. Psychological therapies are an important and popular alternative to antidepressants in the treatment of depression. Many different psychological therapy approaches have been developed over the past century, including cognitive‐behavioural (CBT), behavioural, 'third wave' CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies. In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT), helping people to become aware of their thoughts and to accept them in a non‐judgemental way. The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was effective and acceptable to people in the acute phase of depression. The review included four studies, involving a total of 224 people. The studies examined three different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of extended behavioural activation (two studies), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (one study) and another form of third wave CBT called competitive mind training (one study). Three of the studies compared third wave CBT approaches with treatment as usual control conditions. The fourth study compared ACT with a psychological placebo condition. The results suggested that third wave CBT approaches were effective on a short‐term basis in treating depression. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies/participants included in the review, together with the diverse client groups, interventions and control conditions used and possible allegiance of researchers towards the active treatments, making it difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence. It is notable, too, that none of the studies looked at the long‐term effect of third wave CBT approaches. Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further well‐designed studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are helpful in treating people with acute depression.

An updated search of CCDANCTR restricted to search terms relevant to third wave CBT was conducted in March 2013 (CCDANCTR to 01/02/13). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared various third wave CBT with other psychological therapies for acute depression in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information where required. We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results A total of three studies involving 144 eligible participants were included in the review. Two of the studies (56 participants) compared an early version of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with CBT, and one study (88 eligible participants) compared extended behavioural activation with CBT. No other studies of third wave CBT were identified. The two ACT studies were assessed as being at high risk of performance bias and researcher allegiance. Post‐treatment results, which were based on dropout rates, showed no evidence of any difference between third wave CBT and other psychological therapies for the primary outcomes of efficacy (risk ratio (RR) of clinical response 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.64; very low quality) and acceptability. Results at two‐month follow‐up showed no evidence of any difference between third wave CBT and other psychological therapies for clinical response (2 studies, 56 participants, RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15). Moderate statistical heterogeneity was indicated in the acceptability analyses (I 2  = 41%). Authors' conclusions Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT and CBT approaches are equally effective and acceptable in the treatment of acute depression. Evidence is limited in quantity, quality and breadth of available studies, precluding us from drawing any conclusions as to their short‐ or longer‐term equivalence. The increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice underscores the importance of completing further studies to compare various third wave CBT approaches with other psychological therapy approaches to inform clinicians and policymakers on the most effective forms of psychological therapy in treating depression.

All three studies compared these third wave CBT approaches with CBT. The results suggested that third wave CBT and CBT approaches were equally effective in treating depression. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies of poor quality that we included in the review; therefore it is not possible to conclude whether third wave CBT approaches might be more effective and acceptable than other psychological therapies in the short term or over a longer period of time. Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are more helpful than other psychological therapies in treating people with acute depression.

AB: Abstract - Background Despite modern treatment approaches and a focus on community care, there remains a group of people who cannot easily be discharged from psychiatric hospital directly into the community. Twenty‐four hour residential rehabilitation (a 'ward‐in‐a‐house') is one model of care that has evolved in association with psychiatric hospital closure programmes. Objectives To determine the effects of 24 hour residential rehabilitation compared with standard treatment within a hospital setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2002 and February 2004). Selection criteria We included all randomised or quasi‐randomised trials that compared 24 hour residential rehabilitation with standard care for people with severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted. Data were excluded where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow‐up. For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk and its 95% confidence interval. Main results We identified and included one study with 22 participants with important methodological shortcomings and limitations of reporting. The two‐year controlled study evaluated "new long stay patients" in a hostel ward in the UK. One outcome 'unable to manage in the placement' provided usable data (n=22, RR 7.0 CI 0.4 to 121.4). The trial reported that hostel ward residents developed superior domestic skills, used more facilities in the community and were more likely to engage in constructive activities than those in hospital ‐ although usable numerical data were not reported. These potential advantages were not purchased at a price. The limited economic data was not good but the cost of providing 24 hour care did not seem clearly different from the standard care provided by the hospital ‐ and it may have been less. Authors' conclusions From the single, small and ill‐reported, included study, the hostel ward type of facility appeared cheaper and positively effective. Currently, the value of this way of supporting people ‐ which could be considerable ‐ is unclear. Trials are needed. Any 24 hour care 'ward‐in‐a‐house' is likely to be oversubscribed. We argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. With follow‐up of all eligible for the placements ‐ those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care ‐ real‐world evaluation could take place. In the UK further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. The broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches. Plain language summary Twenty‐four hour care for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a long‐term, chronic, illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. It has a high disability rate and the cost to individuals, their carers and health services is substantial. Although the majority of people with schizophrenia learn to cope in the community, there are some people who need help and reminders if they are to manage self‐care and other aspects of day‐to‐day living. In many countries these people end up as long stay patients on hospital wards. This review aims to look at the economic costs and quality of life of people in 24 hour non‐hospital care compared to those still in hospital. Only one trial of 22 people and lasting two years was identified, and it took place in the UK. Most of the participants but not all had schizophrenia. Half were assigned to live in a house staffed by a psychologist, and enough nurses and nursing assistants to provide 24 hour care. The staff were expected to help prepare and share meals with the residents and the residents had a programme of domestic work and some self‐care tasks. The psychologist worked with each individual to improve social interaction and behaviour. The control group had normal hospital care with access to occupational therapy, industrial therapy and recreational facilities. They were also allowed home on leave and were counted as part of the group if they were discharged, transferred to hostels or in prison. The majority of the data were difficult to interpret because the numbers needed to make statistical comparisons were not given. Three people from the house had to be readmitted to the hospital and several of the others had short stays there. Those people who were resident in the house were reported to be significantly more likely to use social facilities and spent more time in socially constructive activities (self‐care, eating with the group). All other measures reported were not significantly different between the groups. The costs for each group were similar, however if cost was calculated for those in the house who did not use the hospital at all, it was slightly less expensive. This was a small study which was not designed well. A larger, well‐designed trial would answer the question of whether 24 hour care would benefit this group of people.

AB: Abstract - Background Panic disorder is characterised by the presence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks, discrete periods of fear or anxiety that have a rapid onset and include symptoms such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating and shaking. Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. A previous Cochrane meta‐analysis suggested that psychological therapy (either alone or combined with pharmacotherapy) can be chosen as a first‐line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However, it is not yet clear whether certain psychological therapies can be considered superior to others. In order to answer this question, in this review we performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA), in which we compared eight different forms of psychological therapy and three forms of a control condition. Objectives To assess the comparative efficacy and acceptability of different psychological therapies and different control conditions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. Search methods We conducted the main searches in the CCDANCTR electronic databases (studies and references registers), all years to 16 March 2015. We conducted complementary searches in PubMed and trials registries. Supplementary searches included reference lists of included studies, citation indexes, personal communication to the authors of all included studies and grey literature searches in OpenSIGLE. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on adults with a formal diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We considered the following psychological therapies: psychoeducation (PE), supportive psychotherapy (SP), physiological therapies (PT), behaviour therapy (BT), cognitive therapy (CT), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT (3W) and psychodynamic therapies (PD). We included both individual and group formats. Therapies had to be administered face‐to‐face. The comparator interventions considered for this review were: no treatment (NT), wait list (WL) and attention/psychological placebo (APP). For this review we considered four short‐term (ST) outcomes (ST‐remission, ST‐response, ST‐dropouts, ST‐improvement on a continuous scale) and one long‐term (LT) outcome (LT‐remission/response). Data collection and analysis As a first step, we conducted a systematic search of all relevant papers according to the inclusion criteria. For each outcome, we then constructed a treatment network in order to clarify the extent to which each type of therapy and each comparison had been investigated in the available literature. Then, for each available comparison, we conducted a random‐effects meta‐analysis. Subsequently, we performed a network meta‐analysis in order to synthesise the available direct evidence with indirect evidence, and to obtain an overall effect size estimate for each possible pair of therapies in the network. Finally, we calculated a probabilistic ranking of the different psychological therapies and control conditions for each outcome. Main results We identified 1432 references; after screening, we included 60 studies in the final qualitative analyses. Among these, 54 (including 3021 patients) were also included in the quantitative analyses. With respect to the analyses for the first of our primary outcomes, (short‐term remission), the most studied of the included psychological therapies was CBT (32 studies), followed by BT (12 studies), PT (10 studies), CT (three studies), SP (three studies) and PD (two studies). The quality of the evidence for the entire network was found to be low for all outcomes. The quality of the evidence for CBT vs NT, CBT vs SP and CBT vs PD was low to very low, depending on the outcome. The majority of the included studies were at unclear risk of bias with regard to the randomisation process. We found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and detection bias. We also found selective outcome reporting bias to be present and we strongly suspected publication bias. Finally, we found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of researcher allegiance bias. Overall the networks appeared to be well connected, but were generally underpowered to detect any important disagreement between direct and indirect evidence. The results showed the superiority of psychological therapies over the WL condition, although this finding was amplified by evident small study effects (SSE). The NMAs for ST‐remission, ST‐response and ST‐improvement on a continuous scale showed well‐replicated evidence in favour of CBT, as well as some sparse but relevant evidence in favour of PD and SP, over other therapies. In terms of ST‐dropouts, PD and 3W showed better tolerability over other psychological therapies in the short term. In the long term, CBT and PD showed the highest level of remission/response, suggesting that the effects of these two treatments may be more stable with respect to other psychological therapies. However, all the mentioned differences among active treatments must be interpreted while taking into account that in most cases the effect sizes were small and/or results were imprecise. Authors' conclusions There is no high‐quality, unequivocal evidence to support one psychological therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, the results show that CBT ‐ the most extensively studied among the included psychological therapies ‐ was often superior to other therapies, although the effect size was small and the level of precision was often insufficient or clinically irrelevant. In the only two studies available that explored PD, this treatment showed promising results, although further research is needed in order to better explore the relative efficacy of PD with respect to CBT. Furthermore, PD appeared to be the best tolerated (in terms of ST‐dropouts) among psychological treatments. Unexpectedly, we found some evidence in support of the possible viability of non‐specific supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder; however, the results concerning SP should be interpreted cautiously because of the sparsity of evidence regarding this treatment and, as in the case of PD, further research is needed to explore this issue. Behaviour therapy did not appear to be a valid alternative to CBT as a first‐line treatment for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia Why is this review important? Many people suffer from panic disorder. Panic disorder can occur on its own or with agoraphobia. People with panic disorder experience recurring panic attacks. During a panic attack people feel the sudden onset of intense fear alongside a series of bodily symptoms such as a racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. People with agoraphobia feel an intense fear of developing a panic attack in situations where escape might be difficult or embarrassing. This fear often leads to the avoidance of such situations. There are many different types of talking therapies that are used to treat panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However it is not clear whether certain talking therapies are more effective than others at treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In this review we compared the effectiveness of different types of talking therapy. Who will be interested in this review? People with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Friends and family of people with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. General practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists. Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? Are any of the included psychological therapies more effective and better tolerated than others in the rapid reduction of panic/agoraphobia symptoms? Can any of the included psychological therapies guarantee better results one year after termination? Which studies were included in the review? We searched medical databases up to 16 March 2015 to find all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) of talking therapies in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. To be included in the review studies had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We included 60 studies in the review. Fifty‐four of the included studies (involving 3021 participants) were used in numerical analyses. The review authors rated the overall quality of the studies as low to very low. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The results of the review show that in general talking therapies are more effective than no treatment. There was no strong evidence to support one talking therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, there was some low‐quality evidence in favour of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy over other talking therapies for short‐term remission and short‐term reduction in symptoms. The results concerning supportive psychotherapy should, however, be treated with caution because of the small amount of evidence available about this treatment. On the other hand, beyond the evidence regarding its efficacy, psychodynamic therapy also showed promising results in terms of tolerability: as a way of assessing how well people tolerated the talking therapies, we assessed short‐term dropout rates. We found that there were fewer dropouts in psychodynamic therapy and third‐wave CBT, suggesting that people tolerate these therapies better than other therapies. What should happen next? More high‐quality research is needed to be able to fully compare the effectiveness of different talking therapies. In particular, more new studies are needed that compare the specific talking therapies CBT, psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

AB: Abstract - Background Long‐term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to face‐to‐face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e‐health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of e‐health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting‐list controls, or non‐psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 ‐ 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross‐search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand‐searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating any type of long‐term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long‐term physical conditions as those that were more than three‐months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient‐ or clinician‐administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 ( American Psychological Association 2013 ), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria ( World Health Organization 1992 ). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non‐psychological therapies were eligible comparators. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta‐analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. Main results We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta‐analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low‐quality evidence that e‐health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.83, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long‐term physical condition, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. Authors' conclusions At present, the field of e‐health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low‐quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. Although it is too early to recommend e‐health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically‐based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Plain language summary E‐health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions Why is this review important? More than one in ten children and adolescents worldwide have long‐term physical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems, which include anxiety or depression. Treating such problems early can prevent difficulties with friendships, family life, school, and future mental health problems. Accessing traditionally delivered face‐to‐face therapy can be difficult, due to the limited number of services. As technology improves, and therapies become available on computers and mobile telephones, e‐health interventions (delivered by digital means and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) may be useful to treat anxiety and depression in these children and adolescents. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to parents, children and adolescents, mental healthcare providers, service commissioners, and professionals caring for children with long‐term physical conditions. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Are e‐health interventions better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are e‐health interventions acceptable to these children and adolescents? Which studies were included in the review? We searched reference databases to find all randomised controlled trials, cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions that were published between 1970 and August 2017. Trials had to be randomised controlled trials that included children and young people with either symptoms or formal diagnoses of anxiety or depression. We included five trials, with a total of 463 young people, in the review. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We included five trials of three e‐health interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), undertaken with children aged 10 to 18 years old. Although some of these interventions were acceptable to users, none of them were clearly any better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list at reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression.The very low quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. The review authors rated the overall risk of bias in the trials as high or uncertain. What should happen next? Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective e‐health interventions to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.

AB: Abstract - Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in people with Down Syndrome (DS). There is an understanding that an increase in L‐glutamate contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemias and AD. Memantine acts as an antagonist of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) type receptors, which is thought to reduce abnormal activation of glutamate neurotransmission. It binds with a low affinity to the NMDA receptor and so should not prevent learning and the formation of memory. Memantine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time, and is the subject of this review. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of memantine for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of memantine, as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with memantine was administered compared with a placebo group. Data collection and analysis No study was identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review. Main results No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review, however there is an on‐going randomised controlled study being conducted in the UK and data are expected in 2009. Authors' conclusions As there are no included trials, recommendations cannot be made about memantine for AD in DS. Well‐designed, adequately powered studies are required. Plain language summary Memantine for dementia in people with Down syndrome Memantine is thought to improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD over time.The effects of memantine on AD are reported to be beneficial for people with moderate to severe AD in the general population, However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. Results from the one randomised controlled trial for the treatment of dementia in DS are not yet available (expected 2009).

AB: Abstract - Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in people with Down Syndrome (DS). Acetylcholine is a chemical found in the brain that has an important role in memory, attention, reason and language. Galantamine both inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase and increases the level of acetylcholine. Galantamine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of galantamine for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of galantamine as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with galantamine was administered compared with a placebo group. Data collection and analysis No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review. Main results No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions As there are no included trials, recommendations cannot be made about galantamine for AD in DS. Well‐designed, adequately powered studies are required. Plain language summary Galantime for dementia in people with Down syndrome The drug galantamine has been reported to have benefits for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who do not have Down syndrome. However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. This review identified no randomised controlled trials of galantamine in people with Down syndrome. Further research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Even low levels of substance misuse by people with a severe mental illness can have detrimental effects. Objectives To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for reduction in substance use in people with a serious mental illness compared with standard care. Search methods For this update (2013), the Trials Search Co‐ordinator of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSG) searched the CSG Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of major medical and scientific databases. The principal authors conducted two further searches (8 October 2012 and 15 January 2013) of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. A separate search for trials of contingency management was completed as this was an additional intervention category for this update. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocial interventions for substance misuse with standard care in people with serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis We independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. For all meta‐analyses we pooled data using a random‐effects model. Using the GRADE approach, we identified seven patient‐centred outcomes and assessed the quality of evidence for these within each comparison. Main results We included 32 trials with a total of 3165 participants. Evaluation of long‐term integrated care included four RCTs (n = 735). We found no significant differences on loss to treatment (n = 603, 3 RCTs, RR 1.09 CI 0.82 to 1.45,  low quality of evidence ), death by 3 years (n = 421, 2 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.39 to 3.57,  low quality of evidence ), alcohol use (not in remission at 36 months) (n = 143, 1 RCT, RR 1.15 CI 0.84 to 1.56, low quality of evidence ), substance use (n = 85, 1 RCT, RR 0.89 CI 0.63 to 1.25,  low quality of evidence ), global assessment of functioning (n = 171, 1 RCT, MD 0.7 CI 2.07 to 3.47,  low quality of evidence ), or general life satisfaction (n = 372, 2 RCTs, MD 0.02 higher CI 0.28 to 0.32,  moderate quality of evidence ). For evaluation of non‐integrated intensive case management with usual treatment (4 RCTs, n = 163) we found no statistically significant difference for loss to treatment at 12 months (n = 134, 3 RCTs, RR 1.21 CI 0.73 to 1.99,  very low quality of evidence ). Motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioural therapy compared to usual treatment (7 RCTs, total n = 878) did not reveal any advantage for retaining participants at 12 months (n = 327, 1 RCT, RR 0.99 CI 0.62 to 1.59,  low quality of evidence ) or for death (n = 493, 3 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.22 to 2.41,  low quality of evidence) , and no benefit for reducing substance use (n = 119, 1 RCT, MD 0.19 CI ‐0.22 to 0.6,  low quality of evidence ), relapse (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.5 CI 0.24 to 1.04,  very low quality of evidence ) or global functioning (n = 445, 4 RCTs, MD 1.24 CI 1.86 to 4.34,  very low quality of evidence ). Cognitive behavioural therapy alone compared with usual treatment (2 RCTs, n = 152) showed no significant difference for losses from treatment at 3 months (n = 152, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 0.44 to 2.86,  low quality of evidence ). No benefits were observed on measures of lessening cannabis use at 6 months (n = 47, 1 RCT, RR 1.30 CI 0.79 to 2.15,  very low quality of evidence ) or mental state (n = 105, 1 RCT, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale MD 0.52 CI ‐0.78 to 1.82,  low quality of evidence ). We found no advantage for motivational interviewing alone compared with usual treatment (8 RCTs, n = 509) in reducing losses to treatment at 6 months (n = 62, 1 RCT, RR 1.71 CI 0.63 to 4.64,  very low quality of evidence ), although significantly more participants in the motivational interviewing group reported for their first aftercare appointment (n = 93, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 CI 0.53 to 0.9). Some differences, favouring treatment, were observed in abstaining from alcohol (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.36 CI 0.17 to 0.75,  very low quality of evidence ) but not other substances (n = 89, 1 RCT, RR ‐0.07 CI ‐0.56 to 0.42,  very low quality of evidence ), and no differences were observed in mental state (n = 30, 1 RCT, MD 0.19 CI ‐0.59 to 0.21,  very low quality of evidence ). We found no significant differences for skills training in the numbers lost to treatment by 12 months (n = 94, 2 RCTs, RR 0.70 CI 0.44 to 1.1,  very low quality of evidence ). We found no differences for contingency management compared with usual treatment (2 RCTs, n = 206) in numbers lost to treatment at 3 months (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 1.65 CI 1.18 to 2.31,  low quality of evidence ), number of stimulant positive urine tests at 6 months (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 CI 0.65 to 1.06,  low quality of evidence ) or hospitalisations (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.05 to 0.93,  low quality of evidence ). We were unable to summarise all findings due to skewed data or because trials did not measure the outcome of interest. In general, evidence was rated as low or very low due to high or unclear risks of bias because of poor trial methods, or poorly reported methods, and imprecision due to small sample sizes, low event rates and wide confidence intervals. Authors' conclusions We included 32 RCTs and found no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another for people to remain in treatment or to reduce substance use or improve mental state in people with serious mental illnesses. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results. Further high quality trials are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for people with both severe mental illness and substance misuse ‘Dual diagnosis’ is the term used to describe people who have a mental health problem and also have problems with drugs or alcohol. In some areas, over 50% of all those with mental health difficulties will have problems with drugs or alcohol. For people with mental illness, substance misuse often has a negative and damaging effect on the symptoms of their illness and the way their medication works. They may become aggressive or engage in activities that are illegal. Substance misuse can also increase risk of suicide, hepatitis C, HIV, relapse, incarceration and homelessness. People who have substance misuse problems but no mental illness can be treated via a variety of psychosocial interventions. These include motivational interviewing, or MI, that looks at people’s motivation for change; cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, which helps people adapt their behaviour by improving coping strategies; a supportive approach similar to that pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous; family psycho‐education observing the signs and effects of substance misuse; and group or individual skills training. However, using these interventions for people with dual diagnosis is more complex. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for substance reduction in people with a serious mental illness compared to care as usual or standard care. A search for studies was carried out in July 2012; 32 studies were included in the review with a total of 3165 people. These studies used a variety of different psychosocial interventions (including CBT, MI, skills training, integrated models of care). In the main, evidence was graded as low or very low quality and no study showed any great difference between psychosocial interventions and treatment as usual. There was no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another. However, differences in study designs made comparisons between studies problematic. Studies also had high numbers of people leaving early, differences in outcomes measured, and differing ways in which the psychosocial interventions were delivered. More large scale, high quality and better reported studies are required to address these shortcomings. This will better address whether psychosocial interventions are effective and good for people with mental illness and substance misuse problems. This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray from RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background Typical antipsychotic drugs are widely used as the first line treatment for people with schizophrenia. However, the atypical class of antipsychotic drugs are making important inroads into this approach. Atypical is a widely used term used to describe some antipsychotics which have a low propensity to produce movement disorders and raise serum prolactin. There is some suggestion that the different adverse effect profiles of atypical antipsychotic group make them more acceptable to people with schizophrenia. Ziprasidone is one of the newer atypicals with a high serotonin receptor affinity. Objectives To determine the effects of ziprasidone compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses. Search methods Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980‐1999), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 1999), CINAHL (1982‐1999), EMBASE (1980‐1999), MEDLINE (1966‐1999), LILACS (1982‐1996), PSYNDEX (1977‐1999) and PsycLIT (1974‐1999) were undertaken. In addition, pharmaceutical databases on the Dialog Corporation Datastar and Dialog services were searched. References of all identified studies were searched for further trials. Pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer ‐ the manufacturer of ziprasidone ‐ and the manufacturers of all comparator drugs) and first authors of all included trials were contacted. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that compared ziprasidone to other treatments for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses were included by independent assessment. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. Data were independently extracted. Data were excluded if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For homogeneous dichotomous data the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, weighted mean differences were calculated (WMD). All data were inspected for heterogeneity. Main results Data for this compound range from very short (one week) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over six months. For measures of mental state ziprasidone seems more effective than placebo (RR 0.8 CI 0.7‐0.9) and as effective as haloperidol (RR 0.8 CI 0.7‐1). It is less likely than haloperidol to cause movement disorders (RR 0.4 CI 0.2‐0.6), but causes more nausea and vomiting (RR 2.1 CI 1.2‐3.8). The injected form of the drug causes more pain at the injection site than haloperidol (RR 5.3 CI 1.3‐22). Authors' conclusions Currently data are limited. Ziprasidone may be an effective antipsychotic with less extrapyramidal effects than haloperidol. It also, however, causes more nausea and vomiting than the typical drugs, and, at present, there is no data suggesting that it is different to other atypical compounds. Well planned, conducted and reported long term randomised trials are needed if ziprasidone is to be accepted into everyday use.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is common in young people. It has a marked negative impact and is associated with self‐harm and suicide. Preventing its onset would be an important advance in public health. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was last updated in 2011. Objectives To determine whether evidence‐based psychological interventions (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) and third wave CBT)) are effective in preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMDCTR to 11 September 2015), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases:  The Cochrane Library  (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We searched conference abstracts and reference lists of included trials and reviews, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of an evidence‐based psychological prevention programme compared with any comparison control for young people aged 5 to 19 years, who did not currently meet diagnostic criteria for depression. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and rated their risk of bias. We adjusted sample sizes to take account of cluster designs and multiple comparisons. We contacted trial authors for additional information where needed. We assessed the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes using GRADE. Main results We included 83 trials in this review. The majority of trials (67) were carried out in school settings with eight in colleges or universities, four in clinical settings, three in the community and four in mixed settings. Twenty‐nine trials were carried out in unselected populations and 53 in targeted populations. For the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium‐term follow‐up (up to 12 months), there were 32 trials with 5965 participants and the risk of having a diagnosis of depression was reduced for participants receiving an intervention compared to those receiving no intervention (risk difference (RD) ‐0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.05 to ‐0.01; P value = 0.01). We rated this evidence as moderate quality according to the GRADE criteria. There were 70 trials (73 trial arms) with 13,829 participants that contributed to the analysis for the primary outcome of depression symptoms (self‐rated) at the post‐intervention time point, with results showing a small but statistically significant effect (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.27 to ‐0.15; P value < 0.0001). This effect persisted to the short‐term assessment point (up to three months) (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.17; P value < 0.0001; 16 studies; 1558 participants) and medium‐term (4 to 12 months) assessment point (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.05; P value = 0.0002; 53 studies; 11,913 participants); however, the effect was no longer evident at the long‐term follow‐up .  We rated this evidence as low to moderate quality according to the GRADE criteria. The evidence from this review is unclear with regard to whether the type of population modified the overall effects; there was statistically significant moderation of the overall effect for depression symptoms (P value = 0.0002), but not for depressive disorder (P value = 0.08). For trials implemented in universal populations there was no effect for depression diagnosis (RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01) and a small effect for depression symptoms (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.17 to ‐0.05). For trials implemented in targeted populations there was a statistically significantly beneficial effect of intervention (depression diagnosis RD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐0.01; depression symptoms SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.23). Of note were the lack of attention placebo‐controlled trials in targeted populations (none for depression diagnosis and four for depression symptoms). Among trials implemented in universal populations a number used an attention placebo comparison in which the intervention consistently showed no effect. Authors' conclusions Overall the results show small positive benefits of depression prevention, for both the primary outcomes of self‐rated depressive symptoms post‐intervention and depression diagnosis up to 12 months (but not beyond). Estimates of numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB = 11) compare well with other public health interventions. However, the evidence was of moderate to low quality using the GRADE framework and the results were heterogeneous. Prevention programmes delivered to universal populations showed a sobering lack of effect when compared with an attention placebo control. Interventions delivered to targeted populations, particularly those selected on the basis of depression symptoms, had larger effect sizes, but these seldom used an attention placebo comparison and there are practical difficulties inherent in the implementation of targeted programmes. We conclude that there is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes. Future research should focus on current gaps in our knowledge. Given the relative lack of evidence for universal interventions compared with attention placebo controls and the poor results from well‐conducted effectiveness trials of universal interventions, in our opinion any future such trials should test a depression prevention programme in an indicated targeted population using a credible attention placebo comparison group. Depressive disorder as the primary outcome should be measured over the longer term, as well as clinician‐rated depression. Such a trial should consider scalability as well as the potential for the intervention to do harm. Plain language summary Evidence‐based psychological interventions for preventing depression in children and adolescents The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of evidence‐based psychological interventions designed to prevent the onset of a depressive disorder and to reduce any existing symptoms of depression. Who may be interested in this review? People involved in public health initiatives, school personnel and mental health clinicians. Why is this review important? Depressive disorder is common. It is associated with a negative impact on the functioning of young people and is expensive to society at large. Finding a way to prevent the onset of depressive disorder has the potential to make an important impact on the burden of depression in young people. What questions does this review aim to answer? Whether psychological depression prevention programmes designed to prevent the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents are effective. Which trials were included in the review? We included 83 studies (in particular randomised controlled trials) of evidence‐based psychotherapy interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and third wave CBT, interpersonal therapy) that had the specific aim of preventing the onset of depressive disorder. For the primary outcome of depression diagnosis at medium‐term follow‐up (up to 12 months), there were 32 trials with 5965 participants and for the primary outcome of depression symptoms (self‐rated) there were 73 trials with 13,829 participants. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We found that, compared with any comparison group, psychological depression prevention programmes have small positive benefits on depression prevention. There were some problems with the way the trials were done and in particular the results showed that compared to an attention placebo comparison group (a control intervention that controls for non‐specific factors like involvement in a trial and attention from researchers), these programmes had no effect. There is still not enough evidence to support the implementation of depression prevention programmes. However, based on the effects seen for targeted depression prevention programmes (albeit with inadequate control groups), we recommend that further research be undertaken to test the effectiveness of depression prevention programmes in populations of young people who already have some symptoms of depression. Such trials should compare the intervention to an attention placebo comparison group and measure whether depressive diagnosis is prevented in the long term. They also need to consider whether the approach is something that can be implemented in the real world. In addition, they should consider and measure whether the intervention produces harmful outcomes.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic medication is regularly prescribed in care homes to control 'behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia' despite moderate efficacy, significant adverse effects, and available non‐pharmacological alternatives. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to reduce antipsychotic medication in care home residents. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, a number of trial registers and grey literature sources were searched on 19th December 2011. Selection criteria Individual or cluster‐randomised controlled trials comparing a psychosocial intervention aimed at reducing antipsychotic medication with usual care in care home residents or comparing two different approaches. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed risk of bias through selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias, as well as criteria related to cluster design. Authors of relevant studies were contacted for additional information. Owing to clinical heterogeneity of interventions, statistical heterogeneity was not assessed and no meta‐analysis performed. Study results are presented in a narrative form. Main results Four cluster‐randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. All of them investigated complex interventions comprising educational approaches. Three studies offered education and training for nursing staff, one study offered multidisciplinary team meetings as main component of the intervention. There was one high‐quality study, but overall the methodological quality of studies was moderate.   The studies revealed consistent results for the primary end point. All studies documented a decrease of the proportion of residents with antipsychotic drug use or a reduction in days with antipsychotic use per 100 days per resident, respectively. In summary, the reviewed evidence on psychosocial interventions targeting professionals is consistent with a reduction of antipsychotic medication prescription in care home residents. However, owing to heterogeneous approaches, summary effect sizes cannot be determined. Authors' conclusions There is evidence to support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing antipsychotic medication in care home residents. However, the review was based on a small number of heterogeneous studies with important methodological shortcomings. The most recent and methodologically most rigorous study showed the most pronounced effect. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for reducing antipsychotic medication in care home residents In care homes, antipsychotic medication is commonly prescribed to control so called 'behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia' such as agitation, aggression, or restlessness. However, it is questionable whether antipsychotic medication is effective and safe. Adverse effects, such as sedation, falls, and cardiovascular symptoms, are frequent. Therefore, antipsychotic medication should be avoided if possible. This review investigates whether psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing antipsychotic medication in care homes are effective. By psychosocial interventions, we mean programmes that consist of different non‐pharmacological components including talking to the staff, residents, or both. We identified four randomised controlled trials for inclusion in the review. All studies examined, among other components, education targeted at nursing staff in care homes. The methodological quality of three studies was limited, one study showed high quality. In all studies the interventions led to a reduction of antipsychotic medication use, but the overall magnitude of the effect remains unclear.

AB: Abstract - Background Experiencing anxiety and depression is very common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Psychological interventions have been suggested as a potential treatment for these populations. Current research suggests that people with dementia and MCI have limited opportunities for psychological treatments aimed at improving their well‐being. A systematic review of the evidence on their effectiveness is likely to be useful in terms of improving outcomes for patients and for future recommendations for practice. Objectives The main objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing anxiety and depression in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register and additional sources for both published and unpublished data. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a psychological intervention with usual care or a placebo intervention (social contact control) in people with dementia or MCI. Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently to select trials, extract data and assess studies for risk of bias, using a data extraction form. We contacted authors when further information was not available from the published articles. Main results Six RCTs involving 439 participants with dementia were included in the review, but no studies of participants with MCI were identified. The studies included people with dementia living in the community or in nursing home care and were carried out in several countries. Only one of the studies was classified as low risk of bias. Five studies were at unclear or high risk of bias due to uncertainties around randomisation, blinding and selective reporting of results. The studies used the different psychological approaches of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and counselling. Two studies were of multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention‐control educational programs, diagnostic feedback or services slightly above usual care. Meta‐analysis showed a positive effect of psychological treatments on depression (6 trials, 439 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.41 to ‐0.03, moderate quality evidence) and on clinician‐rated anxiety (2 trials, 65 participants, mean difference (MD) ‐4.57; 95% CI ‐7.81 to ‐1.32, low quality evidence), but not on self‐rated anxiety (2 trials, SMD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.54) or carer‐rated anxiety (1 trial, MD ‐2.40; 95% CI ‐4.96 to 0.16). Results were compatible with both benefit and harm on the secondary outcomes of patient quality of life, activities of daily living (ADLs), neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition, or on carers' self‐rated depressive symptoms, but most of the studies did not measure these outcomes. There were no reports of adverse events. Authors' conclusions We found evidence that psychological interventions added to usual care can reduce symptoms of depression and clinician‐rated anxiety for people with dementia. We conclude that psychological interventions have the potential to improve patient well‐being. Further high quality studies are needed to investigate which treatments are most effective and to evaluate the effect of psychological interventions in people with MCI. Plain language summary Psychological treatments for depression and anxiety in dementia and mild cognitive impairment Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although treatment of these symptoms is widely recommended in guidelines, the best way to do this is not clear. Drugs are thought to have limited effectiveness in this context and carry the risk of significant side effects. Psychological treatments can be adapted for use with people with cognitive impairment and may offer an alternative treatment.  This review identified six randomised controlled trials, including 439 participants, in which a psychological treatment for people with dementia was compared to usual care. Most participants had mild dementia, but one trial was conducted with nursing home residents who had more severe dementia. We found no trials of participants with MCI. The psychological interventions used were based on established psychological models such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling, and interpersonal psychodynamic therapy. In two trials, the psychological treatment was combined with other interventions. We found evidence that psychological treatments can reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. There was also some evidence from two trials that CBT may reduce clinician‐rated anxiety symptoms in people with mild dementia. Due to the imprecision of our results, we could not tell whether psychological treatments had an effect on patients' quality of life, ability to perform daily activities, overall psychiatric symptoms, or cognition, or on carers' self‐rated depressive symptoms, but most studies did not measure these outcomes.  Although these results are promising, the small number of studies and the variation between them in the type and duration of treatment make it difficult to draw conclusions about the best way to provide psychological treatment for people with dementia who have symptoms of depression or anxiety. More high quality trials in this area would be beneficial, including trials involving participants with MCI.

AB: Abstract - Background Healthcare workers can suffer from occupational stress as a result of lack of skills, organisational factors, and low social support at work. This may lead to distress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration in quality of life and service provision. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of work‐ and person‐directed interventions compared to no intervention or alternative interventions in preventing stress at work in healthcare workers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC‐2 and Web of Science up to November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers. For organisational interventions, interrupted time‐series and controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies were also eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used Standardised Mean Differences (SMDs) where authors of trials used different scales to measure stress or burnout. We combined studies that were similar in meta‐analyses. We used the GRADE system to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results In this update, we added 39 studies, making a total of 58 studies (54 RCTs and four CBA studies), with 7188 participants. We categorised interventions as cognitive‐behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisational interventions (n = 20). Follow‐up was less than one month in 24 studies, one to six in 22 studies and more than six months in 12 studies. We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health. There was low‐quality evidence that CBT with or without relaxation was no more effective in reducing stress symptoms than no intervention at one month follow‐up in six studies (SMD ‐0.27 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) ‐0.66 to 0.13; 332 participants). But at one to six months follow‐up in seven studies (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.16; 549 participants, 13% relative risk reduction), and at more than six months follow‐up in two studies (SMD ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.70; 157 participants) CBT with or without relaxation reduced stress more than no intervention. CBT interventions did not lead to a considerably greater effect than an alternative intervention, in three studies. Physical relaxation (e.g. massage) was more effective in reducing stress than no intervention at one month follow‐up in four studies (SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.89 to ‐0.08; 97 participants) and at one to six months follow‐up in six studies (SMD ‐0.47; 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.24; 316 participants). Two studies did not find a considerable difference in stress between massage and taking extra breaks. Mental relaxation (e.g. meditation) led to similar stress symptom levels as no intervention at one to six months follow‐up in six studies (SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐1.15 to 0.15; 205 participants) but to less stress in one study at more than six months follow‐up. One study showed that mental relaxation reduced stress more effectively than attending a course on theory analysis and another that it was more effective than just relaxing in a chair. Organisational interventions consisted of changes in working conditions, organising support, changing care, increasing communication skills and changing work schedules. Changing work schedules (from continuous to having weekend breaks and from a four‐week to a two‐week schedule) reduced stress with SMD ‐0.55 (95% CI ‐0.84 to ‐0.25; 2 trials, 180 participants). Other organisational interventions were not more effective than no intervention or an alternative intervention. We graded the quality of the evidence for all but one comparison as low. For CBT this was due to the possibility of publication bias, and for the other comparisons to a lack of precision and risk of bias. Only for relaxation versus no intervention was the evidence of moderate quality. Authors' conclusions There is low‐quality evidence that CBT and mental and physical relaxation reduce stress more than no intervention but not more than alternative interventions. There is also low‐quality evidence that changing work schedules may lead to a reduction of stress. Other organisational interventions have no effect on stress levels. More randomised controlled trials are needed with at least 120 participants that compare the intervention to a placebo‐like intervention. Organisational interventions need better focus on reduction of specific stressors. Plain language summary Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers Background Healthcare workers suffer from work‐related or occupational stress. Often this is because healthcare workers face high expectations and they may not have enough time, skills and social support at work. This can lead to severe distress, burnout or physical illness. In the end, healthcare workers may be unable to provide high quality healthcare services. Stress and burnout can also be costly because affected healthcare workers take sick leave and may even change jobs. We evaluated how well different ways to prevent healthcare workers' stress or burnout work. Study characteristics We included 58 studies that included altogether 7188 participants. Fiftyfour of the included studies were randomised controlled studies and four were non‐randomised studies. We categorised the interventions as either cognitive‐behavioural training, mental and physical relaxation, or organisational changes. Key findings and quality of the evidence Cognitive‐behavioural interventions According to six studies, there was low‐quality evidence that cognitive‐behavioural training decreased stress with about 13% when compared to no intervention and when measured at follow‐up periods ranging from less than a month up to two years. It is unclear how relevant this reduction is for a person with stress. The results were similar when cognitive‐behavioural training was combined with relaxation. However, in three studies, stress levels were similar after a cognitive‐behavioural training course compared to other training that was not focused on stress management but on the content of care. Mental and physical relaxation interventions In 17 studies there was low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that both mental and physical relaxation led to a reduction of 23% in stress levels compared to no intervention. Organisational interventions Organisational interventions were aimed at changing working conditions in 20 studies, improving support or mentoring in six studies, changing content of care in four studies, improving communication skills in one study and improving work schedules in two studies. Shorter or interrupted work schedules reduced stress levels in two studies but there was no clear benefit of any of the other organisational interventions. Conclusions We conclude that cognitive‐behavioural training as well as mental and physical relaxation all reduce stress moderately. Changing work schedules can also reduce stress, but other organisational interventions have no clear effects. We need randomised studies with at least 120 participants and preferably a single component intervention. Organisational interventions need to be better focused on addressing specific factors that cause stress.

AB: Abstract - Background Haloperidol is a benchmark, accessible antipsychotic drug against which the effects of newer treatments are gauged. Objectives To determine the best range of doses for haloperidol for the treatment of people acutely ill with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria We selected studies if they involved people being treated for acute schizophrenia, randomised to two or more dose ranges of non‐depot haloperidol, and if they reported clinically meaningful outcomes. Data collection and analysis For this update, we inspected all citations and independently re‐inspected a sample of citations in order to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and where doubt remained, we acquired the full‐text article for further inspection. We then ordered papers, and reliably re‐inspected and quality assessed the full reports, and extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. We assumed that people who left the study early or were lost to follow‐up had a negative outcome. We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes that reported ITT, last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. We excluded data if loss to follow‐up was greater than 50%. Main results We included 19 trials with 19 different randomised dose comparisons. No studies reported data on relapse rates or quality of life and only one compared low dose (> 1.5 to 3 mg/day) haloperidol to higher dose ranges. Using standard lower dose (> 3 to 7.5 mg/day) did not result in loss of efficacy (no clinically important improvement in global state, versus standard higher dose (> 7.5 to 15 mg/day, n = 48, 1 RCT, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.8,  very‐low‐quality evidence ); versus high dose (> 15 to 35 mg/day, n = 81, 2 RCTs, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2,  very‐low‐quality evidence ). Doses of haloperidol in the range of > 3 to 7.5 mg/day had a lower rate of development of clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects than higher doses (clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects, versus standard higher dose, n = 64, 2 RCTs, RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.1,  very‐low‐quality evidence ); versus high dose, n = 144, 3 RCTs, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8, very‐low‐quality evidence; versus very high dose (> 35 mg/day, n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.1,  very‐low‐quality evidence ). None of the other comparisons between dose ranges yielded statistically significant differences, but several, particularly with lower dose ranges, were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences. Authors' conclusions Noresults were conclusive and all were based on small, short studies of limited quality. However, it would be understandable if clinicians were cautious in prescribing doses in excess of 7.5 mg/day of haloperidol to a person with uncomplicated acute schizophrenia, and if people with schizophrenia were equally reticent to take greater doses. Further research is needed regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the lower dose ranges, especially > 1.5 to 3 mg/day. Plain language summary Haloperidol dose for the acute phase of schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental illness where the person often experiences both positive symptoms (such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs) and negative symptoms (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide for people with schizophrenia. The benefits of antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, need to be weighed against their tendency for causing debilitating side effects (such as movement disorders, weight gain, lack of drive) and in some cases an increased likelihood of physical illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. These debilitating side effects may mean that people stop taking their medication, which can lead to relapse and going into hospital. It is, therefore, important to find a tolerable and effective dose of haloperidol, which helps control the symptoms of schizophrenia but with fewer side effects. The main aim of this review was to determine the best range of doses of haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia. Nineteen trials were included that compared varying doses of haloperidol. Despite over 30 years of trials, data on the effects of differing doses of haloperidol are sparse and poorly reported. This is especially so for the lower dose ranges generally used for the treatment of schizophrenia today. However, lower doses of haloperidol may be just as effective as higher doses but result in fewer side effects. This review also suggests that an important bias against haloperidol may exist in modern trials comparing new drugs with haloperidol. Results are not conclusive and are based on small, short studies of limited quality. The authors of the review note that it would be understandable if psychiatrists were cautious about prescribing doses above 7.5 mg a day and if people with schizophrenia did not want to take higher dosages. Further research is needed to assess the tolerability and effectiveness of lower doses. Low doses of haloperidol may be just as good as higher doses, but with fewer side effects.

AB: Abstract - Background Many drug treatments have been proposed for the treatment of dysthymia, but with so many potential comparisons it is not possible at the present time to determine which is the treatment of choice. There is a need to know whether the different classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy. In addition, the tolerability of treatments may be even more important, since dysthymia is a chronic condition characterised by less severe symptoms than major depression. Objectives To conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials comparing two or more active drug treatments for dysthymia. Search methods Electronic searches of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT and LILACS, Biological Abstracts; reference searching; personal communication; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry. Selection criteria Only randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to compare at least two active drug treatments in the treatment of dysthymia. Exclusion criteria were: non‐randomised studies, studies which included patients with mixed major depression/dysthymia and studies on depression/dysthymia secondary to other disorders (e.g. substance abuse). Data collection and analysis The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption. Main results A total of 14 trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. All studied drugs promoted similar clinical responses, although with different side effect profiles. The evidence for TCAs and SSRIs was the most robust, considering the number of trials and participants. Authors' conclusions The conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made based on consideration of drug‐specific side effect properties.

AB: Abstract - Background Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the induction of a seizure by the administration of an electrical stimulus via electrodes usually placed bilaterally on the scalp and was introduced as a treatment for schizophrenia in 1938. However, ECT is a controversial treatment with concerns about long‐term side effects such a memory loss. Therefore, it is important to determine its clinical efficacy and safety for people with schizophrenia who are not responding to their treatment. Objectives Our primary objective was to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of ECT for people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. Our secondary objectives were to determine whether ECT produces a differential response in people: who are treated with unilateral compared to bilateral ECT; who have had a long (more than 12 sessions) or a short course of ECT; who are given continuation or maintenance ECT; who are diagnosed with well‐defined treatment‐resistant schizophrenia as opposed to less rigorously defined treatment‐resistant schizophrenia (who would be expected to have a greater affective component to their illness). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials including clinical trial registries on 9 September 2015 and 4 August 2017. There were no limitations on language, date, document type, or publication status for the inclusion of records in the register. We also inspected references of all the included records to identify further relevant studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of ECT in people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between the groups and its 95% CIs. We employed the fixed‐effect model for all analyses. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using the GRADE framework. Main results We included 15 studies involving 1285 participants (1264 completers with an average age of 18 to 46 years) with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. We rated most studies (14/15, 93.3%) as at high risk of bias due to issues related to the blinding of participants and personnel. Our main outcomes of interest were: (i) clinically important response to treatment; (ii) clinically important change in cognitive functioning; (iii) leaving the study early; (iv) clinically important change in general mental state; (v) clinically important change in general functioning; (vi) number hospitalised; and (vii) death. No trial reported data on death. The included trials reported useable data for four comparisons: ECT plus standard care compared with sham‐ECT added to standard care; ECT plus standard care compared with antipsychotic added to standard care; ECT plus standard care compared with standard care; and ECT alone compared with antipsychotic alone. For the comparison ECT plus standard care versus sham‐ECT plus standard care, only average endpoint BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) scores from one study were available for mental state; no clear difference between groups was observed (short term; MD 3.60, 95% CI ‐3.69 to 10.89; participants = 25; studies = 1;  very low‐quality evidence ). One study reported data for service use, measured as number readmitted; there was a clear difference favouring the ECT group (short term; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.85; participants = 25; studies = 1;  low‐quality evidence ). When ECT plus standard care was compared with antipsychotics (clozapine) plus standard care, data from one study showed no clear difference for clinically important response to treatment (medium term; RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.58; participants = 162; studies = 1;  low‐quality evidence ). Clinically important change in mental state data were not available, but average endpoint BPRS scores were reported. A positive effect for the ECT group was found (short‐term BPRS; MD ‐5.20, 95% CI ‐7.93 to ‐2.47; participants = 162; studies = 1;  very low‐quality evidence ). When ECT plus standard care was compared with standard care, more participants in the ECT group had a clinically important response (medium term; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.42; participants = 819; studies = 9;  moderate‐quality evidence ). Data on clinically important change in cognitive functioning were not available, but data for memory deterioration were reported. Results showed that adding ECT to standard care may increase the risk of memory deterioration (short term; RR 27.00, 95% CI 1.67 to 437.68; participants = 72; studies = 1;  very low‐quality evidence ). There were no clear differences between groups in satisfaction and acceptability of treatment, measured as leaving the study early (medium term; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.63; participants = 354; studies = 3;  very low‐quality evidence ). Only average endpoint scale scores were available for mental state (BPRS) and general functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning). There were clear differences in scores, favouring ECT group for mental state (medium term; MD ‐11.18, 95% CI ‐12.61 to ‐9.76; participants = 345; studies = 2;  low‐quality evidence ) and general functioning (medium term; MD 10.66, 95% CI 6.98 to 14.34; participants = 97; studies = 2;  very low‐quality evidence ). For the comparison ECT alone versus antipsychotics (flupenthixol) alone, only average endpoint scale scores were available for mental state and general functioning. Mental state scores were similar between groups (medium‐term BPRS; MD ‐0.93, 95% CI ‐6.95 to 5.09; participants = 30; studies = 1;  very low‐quality evidence ); general functioning scores were also similar between groups (medium‐term Global Assessment of Functioning; MD ‐0.66, 95% CI ‐3.60 to 2.28; participants = 30; studies = 1;  very low‐quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that relative to standard care, ECT has a positive effect on medium‐term clinical response for people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. However, there is no clear and convincing advantage or disadvantage for adding ECT to standard care for other outcomes. The available evidence was also too weak to indicate whether adding ECT to standard care is superior or inferior to adding sham‐ECT or other antipsychotics to standard care, and there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ECT alone. More good‐quality evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be made. Plain language summary Electroconvulsive therapy for treatment‐resistant schizophrenia Review question Is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) a safe and effective treatment for people with schizophrenia who have not responded to their previous treatment? Background Electroconvulsive therapy involves the induction of a seizure by the administration of an electrical stimulus via electrodes usually placed bilaterally on the scalp. Electroconvulsive therapy was once widely used as a treatment for people with schizophrenia, but its use in now reduced due to the development of antipsychotic medications and concerns regarding possible long‐term adverse effects of ECT. Methods and results Searches for randomised clinical trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) were conducted in 2015 and updated in 2017. We included 15 studies involving 1285 people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The age range of participants was 18 to 46 years. One study compared adding ECT to standard care with adding sham‐ECT (non‐active ECT); one study compared adding ECT to standard care with adding additional antipsychotic to standard care; and 12 studies compared adding ECT to standard care with standard care. One study compared ECT as the sole treatment with antipsychotics as the sole treatment. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important response to treatment, cognitive functioning, leaving the study early, mental state, general functioning, number hospitalised, and death. None of the included studies reported data for death. The quality of the evidence for each main outcome was mostly very low or low, with the quality of the evidence rated as moderate for only one outcome. This was mostly due to issues with the way the studies were conducted (e.g. participants were not blinded to treatment) and small sample sizes. For the comparison of adding ECT to standard care versus standard care, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that adding ECT to standard care may have some beneficial effect on clinical response to treatment. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that adding ECT to standard care may increase the risk of short‐term memory problems and could have a positive effect on Global Assessment of Functioning scores. Low‐quality evidence indicates that adding ECT to standard care may have a positive effect on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. The evidence for the other comparisons was also of low or very low quality, and overall no clear differences between the treatment groups were found. Conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that adding ECT to standard care has a positive effect on clinical response when compared with standard care. The currently available evidence was too weak to clearly demonstrate that adding ECT to standard treatment is associated with benefits or harm for our other outcomes. There is also a lack of evidence on the effects and safety of adding ECT to standard care compared with sham‐ECT or additional antipsychotics and inadequate evidence regarding the use of ECT alone.

AB: Abstract - Background The new generation antipsychotics are associated with a lower risk of adverse effects compared with drugs such as haloperidol. Many treatment guidelines recommend the use of new generation ('atypical') antipsychotic drugs for people with a first episode of schizophrenia. Objectives To examine the effects of the new generation antipsychotics for people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods The reviewers searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (March 2002) and the included and excluded studies tables of relevant Cochrane reviews, references of all relevant studies, contacted industry and authors of relevant studies to identify further trials. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing new generation antipsychotics (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sulpiride, ziprasidone, zotepine) with conventional antipsychotics for people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by three reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. We independently extracted data but excluded them if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We include two short‐term studies (total n=266), one of which was a report of a sub‐group of a larger study. One compared risperidone with an average of 6 mg/day haloperidol and the other olanzapine with an average of 11 mg/day haloperidol. Compared with olanzapine, significantly more people receiving haloperidol left the study early (n=83, 1 RCT, RR 0.43 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 3 CI 2 to 8). This was not so for the risperidone versus haloperidol comparison (n=183, 1 RCT, RR=0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.1). In terms of global effects, studies reported no differences between risperidone and haloperidol (n=183, RR not much improved 1.0 CI 0.6 to 1.5), and olanzapine and the same control (n=83, RR needing at least one dose of benzodiazepine 0.8 CI 0.5 to 1.1). More people allocated to olanzapine had clinically significant improvement in mental state compared with those given haloperidol (n=83, RR no 'clinically significant improvement' 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6). In the risperidone study, however, no such difference was apparent (n=183, RR 'no clinically significant improvement in mental state' 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.2). Significantly more people given haloperidol (4‐16mg) experienced at least one adverse event when compared with risperidone (4‐16mg) (n=183, RR 0.9 CI 0.8 to 0.98, NNH 8 CI 4 to 50). Use of anticholinergic medication for extrapyramidal adverse events was less prevalent for people allocated either olanzapine (n=83, RR 0.3 CI 0.2 to 0.7, NNH 4 CI 2 to 14) or risperidone (n=183, RR 0.7 CI 0.5 to 0.9, NNH 4 CI 3 to 9) compared with those given haloperidol. There are no data at all on outcomes such as compliance, cost, social and cognitive functioning, relapse, rehospitalisation, or quality of life. There are no medium to long‐term data. Eight ongoing studies may provide more information. Authors' conclusions The results of this review are inconclusive. Whether the use of new generation antipsychotics really makes the treatment less off putting and enhances long‐term compliance is unclear. Pragmatic, well‐designed and reported long‐term trials would be useful to answer this question. Plain language summary New generation antipsychotics for first episode schizophrenia A new generation of antipsychotics, drugs such as olanzapine and risperidone are recommended for people with a first episode of schizophrenia. Currently, the quality of information is too limited to come to any firm conclusions. A number of ongoing studies should provide more and better information in the near future.

AB: Abstract - Background Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health costs. Although a wide range of psychological therapies have been used in the treatment of PTSD there are no systematic reviews of these therapies in children and adolescents. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of psychological therapies in treating children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with PTSD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to December 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) (all years), EMBASE (1974 ‐), MEDLINE (1950 ‐) and PsycINFO (1967 ‐). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We applied no date or language restrictions. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies compared to a control, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or adolescents exposed to a traumatic event or diagnosed with PTSD. Data collection and analysis Two members of the review group independently extracted data. If differences were identified, they were resolved by consensus, or referral to the review team. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes, the standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both, using a fixed‐effect model. If heterogeneity was found we used a random‐effects model. Main results Fourteen studies including 758 participants were included in this review. The types of trauma participants had been exposed to included sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma‐related support service. The psychological therapies used in these studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure‐based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to pharmacological therapies alone or as an adjunct to a psychological therapy. Across all psychological therapies, improvement was significantly better (three studies, n = 80, OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.85) and symptoms of PTSD (seven studies, n = 271, SMD ‐0.90, 95% CI ‐1.24 to ‐0.42), anxiety (three studies, n = 91, SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐1.00 to ‐0.13) and depression (five studies, n = 156, SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.11 to ‐0.36) were significantly lower within a month of completing psychological therapy compared to a control group. The psychological therapy for which there was the best evidence of effectiveness was CBT. Improvement was significantly better for up to a year following treatment (up to one month: two studies, n = 49, OR 8.64, 95% CI 2.01 to 37.14; up to one year: one study, n = 25, OR 8.00, 95% CI 1.21 to 52.69). PTSD symptom scores were also significantly lower for up to one year (up to one month: three studies, n = 98, SMD ‐1.34, 95% CI ‐1.79 to ‐0.89; up to one year: one study, n = 36, SMD ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.44 to ‐0.01), and depression scores were lower for up to a month (three studies, n = 98, SMD ‐0.80, 95% CI ‐1.47 to ‐0.13) in the CBT group compared to a control. No adverse effects were identified. No study was rated as a high risk for selection or detection bias but a minority were rated as a high risk for attrition, reporting and other bias. Most included studies were rated as an unclear risk for selection, detection and attrition bias. Authors' conclusions There is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for treating PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. At this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. There is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others. The findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. In addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. More details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. Future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of PTSD symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub‐scores, are consistently reported. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in children and adolescents who have experienced trauma and has high personal and health costs. The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of all psychological therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents.  We searched for all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies to a control, other psychological therapies or other therapies for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. We identified 14 studies with a total of 758 participants. The types of trauma related to the PTSD were sexual abuse, civil violence, natural disaster, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents. Most participants were clients of a trauma‐related support service. The psychological therapies used in the included studies were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure‐based, psychodynamic, narrative, supportive counselling, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Most included studies compared a psychological therapy to a control group. No study compared psychological therapies to medications or medications in combination with a psychological therapy. There was fair evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly CBT, for the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. More evidence is required for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in the longer term and to be able to compare the effectiveness of one psychological therapy to another. The findings of this review are limited by the potential for bias in the included studies, possible differences between studies which could not be identified, the small number of identified studies and the low number of participants in most studies.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a mental illness causing disordered beliefs, ideas and sensations. Many people with schizophrenia smoke cannabis, and it is unclear why a large proportion do so and if the effects are harmful or beneficial. It is also unclear what the best method is to allow people with schizophrenia to alter their cannabis intake. Objectives To assess the effects of specific psychological treatments for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia.  To assess the effects of antipsychotics for cannabis reduction in people with schizophrenia.  To assess the effects of cannabinoids (cannabis related chemical compounds derived from cannabis or manufactured) for symptom reduction in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, 12 August 2013, which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PUBMED and PsycINFO. We searched all references of articles selected for inclusion for further relevant trials. We contacted the first author of included studies for unpublished trials or data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials involving cannabinoids and schizophrenia/schizophrenia‐like illnesses, which assessed: 1) treatments to reduce cannabis use in people with schizophrenia; 2) the effects of cannabinoids on people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations, selected papers and then re‐inspected the studies if there were discrepancies, and extracted data. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a fixed‐effect model. We excluded data if loss to follow‐up was greater than 50%. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results We identified eight randomised trials, involving 530 participants, which met our selection criteria. For the cannabis reduction studies no one treatment showed superiority for reduction in cannabis use. Overall, data were poorly reported for many outcomes of interest. Our main outcomes of interest were medium‐term data for cannabis use, global state, mental state, global functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment. 1. Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapies (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus treatment as usual Results from one small study showed people receiving adjunct psychological therapies specifically about cannabis and psychosis were no more likely to reduce their intake than those receiving treatment as usual (n = 54, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐2.44 to 2.24,  moderate quality evidence ). Results for other main outcomes at medium term were also equivocal. No difference in mental state measured on the PANSS positive were observed between groups (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.30 95% CI ‐2.55 to 1.95,  moderate quality evidence ). Nor for the outcome of general functioning measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (n = 49, 1 RCT, MD 0.90 95% CI ‐1.15 to 2.95,  moderate quality evidence ). No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest 2. Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapy (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus adjunct non‐specific psychoeducation One study compared specific psychological therapy aimed at cannabis reduction with general psychological therapy. At three‐month follow‐up, the use of cannabis in the previous four weeks was similar between treatment groups (n = 47, 1 RCT, RR 1.04 95% CI 0.62 to 1.74,  moderate quality evidence ). Again, at a medium‐term follow‐up, the average mental state scores from the Brief Pscychiatric Rating Scale‐Expanded were similar between groups (n = 47, 1 RCT, MD 3.60 95% CI ‐ 5.61 to 12.81,  moderate quality evidence ). No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest: global state, general functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment. 3. Reduction in cannabis use: antipsychotic versus antipsychotic In a small trial comparing effectiveness of olanzapine versus risperidone for cannabis reduction, there was no difference between groups at medium‐term follow‐up (n = 16, 1 RCT, RR 1.80 95% CI 0.52 to 6.22,  moderate quality evidence ). The number of participants leaving the study early at medium term was also similar (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.50 95% CI 0.19 to 1.29,  moderate quality evidence ). Mental state data were reported, however they were reported within the short term and no difference was observed. No data were reported for global state, general functioning, and satisfaction with treatment. With regards to adverse effects data, no study reported medium‐term data. Short‐term data were presented but overall, no real differences between treatment groups were observed for adverse effects. 4. Cannabinoid as treatment: cannabidiol versus amisulpride Again, no data were reported for any of the main outcomes of interest at medium term. There were short‐term data reported for mental state using the BPRS and PANSS, no overall differences in mental state were observed between treatment groups. Authors' conclusions Results are limited and inconclusive due to the small number and size of randomised controlled trials available and quality of data reporting within these trials. More research is needed to a) explore the effects of adjunct psychological therapy that is specifically about cannabis and psychosis as currently there is no evidence for any novel intervention being better than standard treatment,for those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia b) decide the most effective drug treatment in treating those that use cannabis and have schizophrenia, and c) assess the effectiveness of cannabidiol in treating schizophrenia. Currently evidence is insufficient to show cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect. Plain language summary Cannabis for schizophrenia Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia smoke cannabis but it is not known why people do so or the effects of smoking cannabis. It is unclear what the best methods are that help people to reduce or stop smoking cannabis. Cannabis is the most consumed illicit drug in the world – amounting to 120 to 224 million users. Cannabis, which is usually smoked or eaten, gives a feeling of well‐being, but in high doses it may also cause mental illness or psychosis. Clinical evidence suggests people who have schizophrenia have a worse overall outcome from using cannabis, however, there are some people with schizophrenia who claim that using cannabis helps their symptoms and reduces the side effects of antipsychotic medication. This review aims to look at the effects of cannabis, both its use and withdrawal, in people who have schizophrenia. A search for trials was conducted in 2013, eight randomised trials, involving 530 participants were included. Five trials investigated the effects of using a specific psychotherapy aimed at reducing cannabis intake, two investigated the effects of antipsychotic medication for cannabis reduction and one investigated the use of cannbidiol (a compound found in cannabis) as a treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia. The results of the review are limited as trial sizes were small and data were poorly reported. Overall, there is currently no evidence for any intervention, whether it is psychological therapy or medication, being better than standard treatment or each other in reducing or stopping the use of cannabis. More research is needed to explore the benefits of medication or psychological therapy for those with schizophrenia who use cannabis. It is unclear if cannabidiol has an antipsychotic effect.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression occurs frequently in patients with diabetes mellitus and is associated with a poor prognosis. Objectives To determine the effects of psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in patients with diabetes and depression. Search methods Electronic databases were searched for records to December 2011. We searched CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ISRCTN Register and clinicaltrials.gov. We examined reference lists of included RCTs and contacted authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in adults with diabetes and depression. Primary outcomes were depression and glycaemic control. Secondary outcomes were adherence to diabetic treatment regimens, diabetes complications, death from any cause, healthcare costs and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently examined the identified publications for inclusion and extracted data from included studies. Random‐effects model meta‐analyses were performed to compute overall estimates of treatment outcomes. Main results The database search identified 3963 references. Nineteen trials with 1592 participants were included. Psychological intervention studies (eight trials, 1122 participants, duration of therapy three weeks to 12 months, follow‐up after treatment zero to six months) showed beneficial effects on short (i.e. end of treatment), medium (i.e. one to six months after treatment) and long‐term (i.e. more than six months after treatment) depression severity (range of standardised mean differences (SMD) ‐1.47 to ‐0.14; eight trials). However, between‐study heterogeneity was substantial and meta‐analyses were not conducted. Short‐term depression remission rates (OR 2.88; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.58 to 5.25; P = 0.0006; 647 participants; four trials) and medium‐term depression remission rates (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.44 to 4.32; P = 0.001; 296 participants; two trials) were increased in psychological interventions compared to usual care. Evidence regarding glycaemic control in psychological intervention trials was heterogeneous and inconclusive. QoL did not improve significantly based on the results of three psychological intervention trials compared to usual care. Healthcare costs and adherence to diabetes and depression medication were examined in only one study and reliable conclusions cannot be drawn. Diabetes complications and death from any cause have not been investigated in the included psychological intervention trials. With regards to the comparison of pharmacological interventions versus placebo (eight trials; 377 participants; duration of intervention three weeks to six months, no follow‐up after treatment) there was a moderate beneficial effect of antidepressant medication on short‐term depression severity (all studies: SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.94 to ‐0.27; P = 0.0004; 306 participants; seven trials; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI): SMD ‐0.39; 95% CI ‐0.64 to ‐0.13; P = 0.003; 241 participants; five trials). Short‐term depression remission was increased in antidepressant trials (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.15; P = 0.01; 136 participants; three trials). Glycaemic control improved in the short term (mean difference (MD) for glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ‐0.4%; 95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.1; P = 0.002; 238 participants; five trials). HRQoL and adherence were investigated in only one trial each showing no statistically significant differences. Medium‐ and long‐term depression and glycaemic control outcomes as well as healthcare costs, diabetes complications and mortality have not been examined in pharmacological intervention trials. The comparison of pharmacological interventions versus other pharmacological interventions (three trials, 93 participants, duration of intervention 12 weeks, no follow‐up after treatment) did not result in significant differences between the examined pharmacological agents, except for a significantly ameliorated glycaemic control in fluoxetine‐treated patients (MD for HbA1c ‐1.0%; 95% CI ‐1.9 to ‐0.2; 40 participants) compared to citalopram in one trial. Authors' conclusions Psychological and pharmacological interventions have a moderate and clinically significant effect on depression outcomes in diabetes patients. Glycaemic control improved moderately in pharmacological trials, while the evidence is inconclusive for psychological interventions. Adherence to diabetic treatment regimens, diabetes complications, death from any cause, health economics and QoL have not been investigated sufficiently. Overall, the evidence is sparse and inconclusive due to several low‐quality trials with substantial risk of bias and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions. Plain language summary Psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in patients with diabetes mellitus Depression occurs nearly one and a half times more often in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes and is associated with a poor prognosis. This review examined clinical trials on psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs in depressed patients with diabetes. The objective was to determine the effects of these treatments on depression, blood sugar, adherence to diabetic treatment regimens, diabetes complications, death from any cause, healthcare costs and health‐related quality of life. Nineteen trials with 1592 participants were identified as relevant for the review. Eight trials with 1122 participants investigated psychological treatments versus usual care (duration of therapy three weeks to 12 months, follow‐up after treatment zero to six months). Eight trials with 377 participants examined antidepressant drugs versus placebo (duration of intervention three weeks to six months, no follow‐up after treatment). Three trials with 93 participants compared the effects of two different antidepressant medications (duration of intervention 12 weeks, no follow‐up after treatment). In summary, psychological treatments and antidepressant drugs have a moderate, yet positive, effect on depression outcomes in diabetes patients. Antidepressant drugs have a positive effect on blood glucose, whereas effects on blood glucose are inconclusive for psychological treatments. Patient‐rated quality of life did not benefit from psychological or antidepressant drug treatments. Healthcare costs, death from any cause and diabetes complications have not been examined sufficiently. Serious or severe adverse effects were either rare (pharmacological treatments) or not reported (psychological treatments). Overall, the evidence is sparse and inconclusive due to several low‐quality trials and the large variety regarding trial characteristics.

AB: Abstract - Background Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in primary and secondary care settings. During the last 20 years, antidepressant prescribing has risen dramatically in western countries, mainly because of the increasing consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and newer antidepressants, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram is the pure S‐enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with tricyclics, other SSRIs, heterocyclics and newer agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods Electronic databases were searched up to July 2008. Trial databases of drug‐approving agencies were hand‐searched for published, unpublished and ongoing controlled trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing escitalopram against any other antidepressant (including non‐conventional agents such as hypericum) for patients with major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used). Data collection and analysis Data were entered by two review authors (double data entry). Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI) using the random effects model. Main results Fourteen trials compared escitalopram with another SSRI and eight compared escitalopram with a newer antidepressive agent (venlafaxine, bupropion and duloxetine). Escitalopram was shown to be significantly more effective than citalopram in achieving acute response (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.87). Escitalopram was also more effective than citalopram in terms of remission (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93). Significantly fewer patients allocated to escitalopram withdrew from trials compared with patients allocated to duloxetine, for discontinuation due to any cause (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99). Authors' conclusions Some statistically significant differences favouring escitalopram over other antidepressive agents for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found, in terms of efficacy (citalopram and fluoxetine) and acceptability (duloxetine). There is insufficient evidence to detect a difference between escitalopram and other antidepressants in early response to treatment (after two weeks of treatment). Cost‐effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Furthermore, as with most standard systematic reviews, the findings rely on evidence from direct comparisons. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should also be borne in mind. Plain language summary Escitalopram versus other antidepressive agents for depression Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram, the last SSRI introduced in the market, is the pure S‐enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Twenty‐two randomised controlled trials (about 4000 participants) were included in the present review. Escitalopram appears to be suitable as first‐line antidepressant treatment for people with moderate to severe major depression. It has been compared with only a few other antidepressants and so we are unable to say whether it is better, worse or the same as many of the other drugs used in practice. However, it did perform better than citalopram when we brought together the results of six studies in nearly two thousand patients

AB: Abstract - Background Despite the high prevalence of apathy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and its harmful effects, there are currently no therapies proven to treat this symptom. Recently, a number of pharmacological therapies have been investigated as potential treatments for apathy in AD. Objectives Objective 1: To assess the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD).    Objective 2: To assess the effect on apathy of pharmacotherapies investigated for other primary outcomes in the treatment of AD. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal, ICTRP on 17 May 2017. Selection criteria Eligible studies were double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials (RCTs) investigating apathy as a primary or secondary outcome in people with AD. Data collection and analysis Three review authors extracted data. We assessed the risks of bias of included studies using Cochrane methods, and the overall quality of evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We calculated mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals on an intention‐to‐treat basis for all relevant outcome measures. Main results We included 21 studies involving a total of 6384 participants in the quantitative analyses. Risk of bias is very low to moderate. All studies reported appropriate methods of randomization and blinding. Most studies reported appropriate methods of allocation concealment. Four studies, three with methylphenidate and one with modafinil, had a primary aim of improving apathy. In these studies, all participants had clinically significant apathy at baseline. Methylphenidate may improve apathy compared to placebo. This finding was present when apathy was assessed using the apathy evaluation scale (AES), which was used by all three studies investigating methylphenidate: MD ‐4.99, 95% CI ‐9.55 to ‐0.43, n = 145, 3 studies, low quality of evidence, but not when assessed with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI)‐apathy subscale, which was used by two of the three studies investigating methylphenidate: MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐3.85 to 3.69, n = 85, 2 studies, low quality of evidence. As well as having potential benefits for apathy, methylphenidate probably also slightly improves cognition (MD 1.98, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.91, n = 145, 3 studies, moderate quality of evidence), and probably improves instrumental activities of daily living (MD 2.30, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.86, P = 0.004, n = 60, 1 study, moderate quality of evidence), compared to placebo. There may be no difference between methylphenidate and placebo in the risk of developing an adverse event: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.42, n = 145, 3 studies, low quality of evidence. There was insufficient evidence from one very small study of modafinil to determine the effect of modafinil on apathy assessed with the FrSBe‐apathy subscale: MD 0.27, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 4.05, n = 22, 1 study, low quality of evidence. In all other included studies, apathy was a secondary outcome and participants were not selected on the basis of clinically significant apathy at baseline. We considered the evidence on apathy from these studies to be indirect and associated with publication bias. There was low or very low quality of evidence on cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) (six studies), ChEI discontinuation (one study), antipsychotics (two studies), antipsychotic discontinuation (one study), antidepressants (two studies), mibampator (one study), valproate (three studies) and semagacestat (one study). Authors' conclusions Methylphenidate may demonstrate a benefit for apathy and may have slight benefits for cognition and functional performance in people with AD, but this finding is associated with low‐quality evidence. Our meta‐analysis is limited by the small number of studies within each drug class, risk of bias, publication bias, imprecision and inconsistency between studies. Additional studies should be encouraged targeting people with AD with clinically significant apathy which investigate apathy as a primary outcome measure, and which have a longer duration and a larger sample size. This could increase the quality of evidence for methylphenidate, and may confirm whether or not it is an effective pharmacotherapy for apathy in AD. Plain language summary Drug treatments for apathy in Alzheimer's disease Review question We wanted to know whether there are any medications that are safe and effective for reducing apathy in people with Alzheimer's disease. Background Apathy is a state of reduced interest, lack of initiative and reduced activity. It is a very common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. It is often persistent and it is known to be linked to a lower quality of life, faster decline and more burden on caregivers. Effective treatments of apathy could improve the quality of life for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. What we did We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to May 2017 which had compared any medicine with a placebo (dummy pill) and measured the effect on apathy in people with Alzheimer's disease. We were only interested in trials in which it was decided randomly whether the people taking part got the drug of interest or the placebo; this was to make sure that the comparison was as fair as possible. What we found We found 21 RCTs involving more than 6300 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Four trials of two different medicines (methylphenidate and modafinil) had been done specifically to study apathy, so all the people taking part were known to be significantly apathetic before the trial started. The other 17 trials had other primary aims, but reported some data on apathy. The trials were generally well designed and conducted. From the three trials with methylphenidate, we found that it may improve apathy, although this depended on how the apathy was measured. The people taking methylphenidate also did slightly better than those taking placebo on scales measuring cognition (thinking, remembering, etc.) and some daily activities, but it was not clear that these effects were big enough to be important in practice. We found no evidence that it caused more side effects than placebo. The quality of this evidence was low or moderate, so we cannot be certain that other similar studies would not have different results. There was only one very small trial with modafinil and there was no evidence that it was effective for apathy. The other 17 trials studied a variety of medicines and included people who were not necessarily significantly apathetic to start with. We therefore thought they were only indirectly relevant to our review question. It is also highly likely that other trials of the same drugs have measured apathy but have not published the results, so we were concerned about possible publication bias (that the studies we found could have been a biased subset). We therefore thought the quality of evidence for all these other medicines was low or very low, meaning that we can have limited or little confidence in the results. Conclusions Current evidence suggests that methylphenidate may be useful for treating apathy in Alzheimer's disease. However, more trials should be done specifically targeting apathy in order to improve the overall quality of the evidence.

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive impairments, particularly memory problems, are a defining feature of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are specific interventional approaches designed to address difficulties with memory and other aspects of cognitive functioning. The present review is an update of previous versions of this review. Objectives The main aim of the current review was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in relation to important cognitive and non‐cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia and the primary caregiver in the short, medium and long term. Search methods The CDCIG Specialized Register, ALOIS, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS and many other clinical trial databases and grey literature sources, was most recently searched on 2 November 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, comparing cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive training interventions with control conditions, and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the family caregiver, were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Eleven RCTs reporting cognitive training interventions were included in the review. A large number of measures were used in the different studies, and meta‐analysis could be conducted for 11 of the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. The unit of analysis in the meta‐analysis was the change from baseline score. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated using a fixed‐effect model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured using a standard Chi 2  statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing examination of effect sizes, but no meta‐analysis could be conducted. Main results Cognitive training was not associated with positive or negative effects in relation to any reported outcomes. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate. The single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation found promising results in relation to a number of participant and caregiver outcomes, and was generally of high quality. Authors' conclusions Available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. However, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. The results of the single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. Further, well‐designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. Researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately using available terminology. Plain language summary Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and vascular disease is an enormous public health problem. Currently, an estimated 36 million people worldwide live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective interventions to reduce the burden of disease are urgently needed. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are non‐pharmacological methods that aim to help people with early‐stage dementia make the most of their memory and cognitive functioning despite the difficulties they are experiencing. Cognitive training focuses on guided practice on a set of tasks that reflect particular cognitive functions, such as memory, attention or problem‐solving. Cognitive rehabilitation focuses on identifying and addressing individual needs and goals, which may require strategies for taking in new information or compensatory methods such as using memory aids. This review included 11 trials of cognitive training and a single trial of cognitive rehabilitation. We found no evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive functioning, mood or activities of daily living in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia; however the quality of the studies was generally not high. The single trial of cognitive rehabilitation provided preliminary indications of the potential benefits of individual cognitive rehabilitation in improving activities of daily living in people with mild Alzheimer's disease. More high‐quality trials of both cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are needed to establish their efficacy for people with early‐stage dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Children and adolescents who have experienced trauma are at high risk of developing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other negative emotional, behavioural and mental health outcomes, all of which are associated with high personal and health costs. A wide range of psychological treatments are used to prevent negative outcomes associated with trauma in children and adolescents. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological therapies in preventing PTSD and associated negative emotional, behavioural and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents who have undergone a traumatic event. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register to 29 May 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from  The Cochrane Library ( all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We did not restrict the searches by date, language or publication status. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies compared with a control such as treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or adolescents who had undergone a traumatic event. Data collection and analysis Two members of the review group independently extracted data. We calculated odds ratios for binary outcomes and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes using a random‐effects model. We analysed data as short‐term (up to and including one month after therapy), medium‐term (one month to one year after therapy) and long‐term (one year or longer). Main results Investigators included 6201 participants in the 51 included trials. Twenty studies included only children, two included only preschool children and ten only adolescents; all others included both children and adolescents. Participants were exposed to sexual abuse in 12 trials, to war or community violence in ten, to physical trauma and natural disaster in six each and to interpersonal violence in three; participants had suffered a life‐threatening illness and had been physically abused or maltreated in one trial each. Participants in remaining trials were exposed to a range of traumas. Most trials compared a psychological therapy with a control such as treatment as usual, wait list or no treatment. Seventeen trials used cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT); four used family therapy; three required debriefing; two trials each used eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), narrative therapy, psychoeducation and supportive therapy; and one trial each provided exposure and CBT plus narrative therapy. Eight trials compared CBT with supportive therapy, two compared CBT with EMDR and one trial each compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, exposure plus supportive therapy with supportive therapy alone and narrative therapy plus CBT versus CBT alone. Four trials compared individual delivery of psychological therapy to a group model of the same therapy, and one compared CBT for children versus CBT for both mothers and children. The likelihood of being diagnosed with PTSD in children and adolescents who received a psychological therapy was significantly reduced compared to those who received no treatment, treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for up to a month following treatment (odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.77; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6.25, 95% CI 3.70 to 16.67; five studies; 874 participants). However the overall quality of evidence for the diagnosis of PTSD was rated as very low. PTSD symptoms were also significantly reduced for a month after therapy (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.61 to ‐0.24; 15 studies; 2051 participants) and the quality of evidence was rated as low. These effects of psychological therapies were not apparent over the longer term. CBT was found to be no more or less effective than EMDR and supportive therapy in reducing diagnosis of PTSD in the short term (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.91; 2 studies; 160 participants), however this was considered very low quality evidence. For reduction of PTSD symptoms in the short term, there was a small effect favouring CBT over EMDR, play therapy and supportive therapies (SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.05; 7 studies; 466 participants). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as moderate. We did not identify any studies that compared pharmacological therapies with psychological therapies. Authors' conclusions The meta‐analyses in this review provide some evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in prevention of PTSD and reduction of symptoms in children and adolescents exposed to trauma for up to a month. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by the quality of the included studies and by substantial heterogeneity between studies. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies for children exposed to trauma, particularly over the longer term. High‐quality studies should be conducted to compare these therapies. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents Why is this review important? Children and adolescents who have experienced trauma are at high risk of developing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and negative psychological and social outcomes. Who will be interested in this review? Children and adolescents who have undergone trauma and their families and caregivers will be interested in this review, along with healthcare professionals, particularly those working in mental health services for children and adolescents. What questions does this review aim to answer? • What are the effects of psychological therapies in preventing PTSD and other negative emotional, behavioural and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents exposed to a traumatic event? • Which psychological therapies are most effective? • Are psychological therapies more effective than pharmacological therapies or other treatments? Which studies were included in the review? Review authors searched databases to May 2015 to find all relevant trials. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include both children and adolescents exposed to trauma. We included 51 trials with a total of 6201 participants. Participants had been exposed to sexual abuse in 12 trials, to war or community violence in ten, to physical trauma and natural disaster in six each and to interpersonal violence in three. In one trial each, participants had suffered a life‐threatening illness or had been physically abused or maltreated. Participants in the remaining trials were exposed to a range of traumas. Most trials compared psychological therapy with a control condition such as treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment; others compared different psychological therapies. A total of 43 studies reported outcomes recorded within the first month after treatment; 27 studies reported outcomes from one month up to a year, and eight reported data for a year or longer after treatment. What does evidence presented in the review tell us? Children and adolescents receiving psychological therapies were less likely to be diagnosed with PTSD and had fewer symptoms of PTSD up to a month after treatment compared with those who received no treatment, treatment as usual or were on a waiting list. Our confidence in these findings is limited as the overall quality of evidence was very low to low. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies beyond one month. There was moderate quality evidence that cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) might be more effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD compared to other psychological therapies for up to a month. Adverse effects were not reported. There were no studies which compared psychological therapies to drug treatments. What should happen next? Researchers should conduct high‐quality trials to further evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies for children and adolescents exposed to trauma. These trials should be designed to ensure that participants and their families are not aware of whether they are receiving psychological therapy, particularly when measures are completed by participants or their parents. In addition, efforts should be made to ensure high rates of follow‐up beyond one month after completion of therapy. In addition, studies should compare different types of psychological therapy to give a better indication of whether children and adolescents exposed to different types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to these therapies.

AB: Abstract - Background Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder which, after a sufficient delay, may be diagnosed amongst individuals who respond with intense fear, helplessness or horror to traumatic events. There is some evidence that the use of pharmacological interventions immediately after exposure to trauma may reduce the risk of developing of PTSD. Objectives To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for the prevention of PTSD in adults following exposure to a traumatic event. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) (to 14 February 2014). This register contains relevant reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (all years); EMBASE (1974 to date); MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We identified unpublished trials by searching the National Institute of Health (NIH) Reporter, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials database (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to December 2013). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We placed no constraints on language and setting. Selection criteria We restricted studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions compared with placebo for the prevention of PTSD in adults. Data collection and analysis Two authors (TA and JI) independently assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion based on the review selection criteria. We independently extracted sample, methodological, outcome and 'Risk of bias' data, as well as the number of side effects, from each trial and entered these into a customised data extraction form. We contacted investigators for missing information. We calculated summary statistics for continuous and dichotomous variables (if provided). We did not undertake subgroup analyses due to the small number of included studies. Main results We included nine short‐term RCTs (duration 12 weeks or less) in the analysis (345 participants; age range 18 to 76 years). Participants were exposed to a variety of traumas, ranging from assault, traffic accidents and work accidents to cardiac surgery and septic shock. Seven studies were conducted at single centres. The seven RCTs included four hydrocortisone studies, three propranolol studies (of which one study had a third arm investigating gabapentin), and single trials of escitalopram and temazepam. Outcome assessment measures included the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the 36‐Item Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale (CES‐D). In four trials with 165 participants there was moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone in preventing the onset of PTSD (risk ratio (RR) 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.56; P value = 0.004), indicating that between seven and 13 patients would need to be treated with this agent in order to prevent the onset of PTSD in one patient. There was low quality evidence for preventing the onset of PTSD in three trials with 118 participants treated with propranolol (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.59; P value = 0.32). Drop‐outs due to treatment‐emergent side effects, where reported, were low for all of the agents tested. Three of the four RCTs of hydrocortisone reported that medication was more effective than placebo in reducing PTSD symptoms after a median of 4.5 months after the event. None of the single trials of escitalopram, temazepam and gabapentin demonstrated evidence that medication was superior to placebo in preventing the onset of PTSD. Seven of the included RCTs were at a high risk of bias. Differential drop‐outs between groups undermined the results of three studies, while one study failed to describe how the allocation of medication was concealed. Other forms of bias that might have influenced study results included possible confounding through group differences in concurrent medication and termination of the study based on treatment response. Authors' conclusions There is moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone for the prevention of PTSD development in adults. We found no evidence to support the efficacy of propranolol, escitalopram, temazepam and gabapentin in preventing PTSD onset. The findings, however, are based on a few small studies with multiple limitations. Further research is necessary in order to determine the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in preventing PTSD and to identify potential moderators of treatment effect. Plain language summary Medications to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): a review of the evidence Who may be interested in this review? ‐ People affected by PTSD and their families.  ‐ Professionals working in adult mental health services.  ‐ General practitioners.  ‐ Charities that support victims of trauma or members of the armed forces. Why is this review important? PTSD is a condition experienced by some people after traumatic experiences such as warfare or domestic violence. People with PTSD experience symptoms of intense fear, helplessness and horror. Research suggests that changes in stress hormones in the brain may contribute to PTSD. Giving people medications which work in the brain soon after traumatic events may be able to prevent PTSD from developing. Previous reviews have shown that talking therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy ‐ CBT) is effective in preventing PTSD. This is the first review of medication as a preventative treatment for PTSD. What questions does this review aim to answer? ‐ Is medication an effective preventative treatment for PTSD compared to placebo (dummy pills)?  ‐ Is medication an acceptable treatment (do people stop medication due to side effects)? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases to find all studies comparing medication with placebo for the prevention of PTSD, published up until February 2014. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials. Studies were included if they had adult participants aged over 18 who had experienced traumatic events but did not have a diagnosis of PTSD at the time of starting medication. We included nine studies with a total of 345 participants in the review. Seven out of the nine studies had a high risk of bias due to problems with the research design. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was moderate quality evidence that hydrocortisone (a steroid medication) prevented PTSD. There was moderate quality evidence that hydrocortisone reduced the severity of PTSD symptoms. There was no evidence that propranolol (a beta‐blocker), escitalopram (a type of antidepressant), temazepam (a tranquillizer) or gabapentin (an anticonvulsant) prevented PTSD. All medications were acceptable, with low numbers of people dropping out due to side effects; however not all studies provided information on this. What should happen next? The review authors do not feel there is sufficient evidence yet to recommend any medication as a preventative treatment for PTSD. The review authors recommend that future high quality research is needed to provide stronger evidence for the effectiveness of medications in preventing PTSD.

AB: Abstract - Background Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders that frequently co‐occur with alcohol use disorders. Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes, and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions. In addition, improved understanding of the biological basis of the conditions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medications for the treatment of people with both diagnoses. Objectives To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication in improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than other medications in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders. Search methods Review authors searched the specialized registers of The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR, to January 2014) and the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG, to March 2013) for eligible trials. These registers contain reports of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Review authors ran complementary searches on EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (ETOH) (to August 2013). We located unpublished trials through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER service and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to August 2013). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. Selection criteria All true RCTs of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety disorders with comorbid alcohol use disorders. Trials assessing drugs administered for the treatment of drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone, disulfiram and acomprosate were not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. Data collection and analysis A systematic review is a standardised evaluation of all research studies that address a particular clinical issue. Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We calculated categorical and continuous treatment effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment using a random‐effects model with effect‐size variability expressed using Chi 2  and I 2  heterogeneity statistics. Main results We included five placebo‐controlled pharmacotherapy RCTs (with 290 participants) in the review. Most of the trials provided little information on how randomization was performed or on whether both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention. Two of the three trials reporting superiority of medication compared with placebo on anxiety symptom outcomes were industry funded. We regarded one trial as being at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. Study participants had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III‐ and DSM IV‐diagnosed alcohol use disorders and post‐traumatic stress disorder (two studies), social anxiety disorder (SAD; two studies) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; one study). Four trials assessed the efficacy of the selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors (SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine); one RCT investigated the efficacy of buspirone, a 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) partial agonist. Treatment duration lasted between eight and 24 weeks. Overall, 70% of participants included in the review were male. There was very low quality evidence for an effect of paroxetine on global clinical response to treatment, as assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions ‐ Improvement scale (CGI‐I). Global clinical response was observed in more than twice as many participants with paroxetine than with placebo (57.7% with paroxetine versus 25.8% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.41; 2 trials, 57 participants). However, there was substantial uncertainty regarding the size of the effect of paroxetine due to the small number of studies providing data on clinically diverse patient samples. The second primary outcome measure was reduction of anxiety symptom severity. Although study investigators reported that buspirone (one trial) was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms over 12 weeks, no evidence of efficacy was observed for paroxetine (mean difference (MD) ‐14.70, 95% CI ‐33.00 to 3.60, 2 trials, 44 participants) and sertraline (one trial). Paroxetine appeared to be equally effective in reducing the severity of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine in one RCT. The maximal reduction in anxiety disorder symptom severity was achieved after six weeks with paroxetine (two RCTs) and 12 weeks with buspirone (one RCT), with maintenance of medication efficacy extending to 16 with paroxetine and 24 weeks with buspirone. There was no evidence of an effect for any of the medications tested on abstinence from alcohol use or depression symptoms. There was very low quality evidence that paroxetine was well tolerated, based on drop‐out due to treatment‐emergent adverse effects. Nevertheless, levels of treatment discontinuation were high, with 43.1% of the participants in the studies withdrawing from medication treatment. Certain adverse effects, such as sexual problems, were commonly reported after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline. Authors' conclusions The evidence‐base for the effectiveness of medication in treating anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorders is currently inconclusive. There was a small amount of evidence for the efficacy of medication, but this was limited and of very low quality. The majority of the data for the efficacy and tolerability of medication were for SSRIs; there were insufficient data to establish differences in treatment efficacy between medication classes or patient subgroups. There was a small amount of very low quality evidence that medication was well tolerated. There was no evidence that alcohol use was responsive to medication. Large, rigorously conducted RCTs would help supplement the small evidence‐base for the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders. Further research on patient subgroups who may benefit from pharmacological treatment, as well as novel pharmacological interventions, is warranted. Plain language summary Medication for treating anxiety disorders in people with alcohol use problems Who may be interested in this review? People with anxiety disorders and alcohol use problems, as well as their healthcare providers. Why is this review important? People with anxiety disorders often also abuse alcohol or have alcohol dependence. All anxiety disorders involve long‐lasting and excessive fear, and can be classified according to the cause of the fear: generalized anxiety disorder (everyday situations), obsessive‐compulsive disorder (repetitive thoughts and behaviours), panic disorder (panic attacks), post‐traumatic stress disorder (previous traumatic events), social anxiety disorder (negative judgements by others) and specific phobia (specific objects or situations). When people with anxiety disorders abuse or are dependent on alcohol, they may be more disabled and difficult to treat than when they have either condition on its own. Psychotherapy is most often used in treating anxiety disorders in people with alcohol use problems. In psychotherapy people are encouraged to explore their feelings, moods, behaviours, thoughts and reactions to the cause of their anxiety. Psychotherapy does not always work though, so it is important to test whether medications are an effective treatment option. What questions does this review aim to answer? We wanted to find out whether medication is effective in treating people with both anxiety disorders and alcohol use problems. For this reason, we systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medication in treating people with both disorders. RCTs provide a more accurate measure of the effectiveness of medication by making sure that people in the study have an equal chance of being treated with medication or placebo. Which studies were included in the review? This review found five RCTs in 290 adults (average age 37.4 years) with anxiety and alcohol use disorders. The evidence is current up to January 2014. Two trials looked at social anxiety disorder, two looked at post‐traumatic stress disorder and one trial looked at generalized anxiety disorder. All of the included trials took place in the USA. Most of the study participants were male (70%), and were classified as having alcohol dependence (79%). What does the evidence from the review tell us? It was not possible to tell whether medication was effective in treating people with anxiety and alcohol use disorders. Although more than twice as many people (57.7%) with social anxiety disorder who were treated with paroxetine in two trials showed signs of clinical improvement compared with people receiving placebo (25.8%), the quality of the evidence was very low. One study reported that buspirone reduced anxiety disorder symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment. None of the other studies found reductions in symptoms. Treatment with medication appeared to be acceptable to participants, but again the quality of the evidence showing this was very low. Certain medication side effects, such as sexual problems, were commonly reported after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline. There was no evidence that treatment had an effect on alcohol use. It was difficult to interpret the findings reported by the studies included in this review. Many participants (43.1% altogether) dropped out of the studies before treatment ended. In addition, outcomes that were reported were either not precise, or appeared to be based on the selective reporting of measures that showed an effect of medication. Funding of two of the studies by drug companies may also have led to reporting of results that favoured the medication.

AB: Abstract - Background Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder which has been shown to affect 2 to 3.5% of people during their lifetimes. Inadequate response occurs in 40% to 60% of people that are prescribed first line pharmaceutical treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). To date not much is known about the efficacy and adverse effects of second‐generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) in people suffering from OCD. Objectives To evaluate the effects of SGAs (monotherapy or add on) compared with placebo or other forms of pharmaceutical treatment for people with OCD. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched up to 21 July 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted key authors and drug companies. Selection criteria We included double‐blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral SGAs (monotherapy or add on) in adults with other forms of pharmaceutical treatment or placebo in people with primary OCD. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results We included 11 RCTs with 396 participants on three SGAs. All trials investigated the effects of adding these SGAs to antidepressants (usually SSRIs). The duration of all trials was less than six months. Only 13% of the participants left the trials early. Most trials were limited in terms of quality aspects. Two trials examined olanzapine and found no difference in the primary outcome (response to treatment) and most other efficacy‐related outcomes but it was associated with more weight gain than monotherapy with antidepressants. Quetiapine combined with antidepressants was also not any more efficacious than placebo combined with antidepressants in terms of the primary outcome, but there was a significant superiority in the mean Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y‐BOCS) score at endpoint (MD ‐2.28, 95% CI ‐4.05 to ‐0.52). There were also some beneficial effects of quetiapine in terms of anxiety or depressive symptoms. Risperidone was more efficacious than placebo in terms of the primary outcome (number of participants without a significant response) (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66) and in the reduction of anxiety and depression (MD ‐7.60, 95% CI ‐12.37 to ‐2.83).  Authors' conclusions The available data of the effects of olanzapine in OCD are too limited to draw any conclusions. There is some evidence that adding quetiapine or risperidone to antidepressants increases efficacy, but this must be weighed against less tolerability and limited data. Plain language summary Second‐generation antipsychotic drugs for obsessive compulsive disorder This review found some trials comparing the effects of adding second‐generation antipsychotic drugs or placebo to antidepressants in obsessive compulsive disorder. There were only 11 trials on three second‐generation antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). While not much can be said about olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone showed some efficacy benefit, but also adverse effects.

AB: Abstract - Background Mirtazapine has a unique mechanism of antidepressive action and is one of the commonly used antidepressants in clinical practice. Objectives The aim of the present review was to assess the evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of mirtazapine compared with other antidepressive agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group's specialised register (CCDANCTR), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years to April 2011), EMBASE, (1980 to July 2011) MEDLINE (1950 to July 2011) and PsycINFO (1974 to July 2011). Reference lists of the reports of relevant studies were checked and experts in the field contacted. The review was not limited to English‐language articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants with major depression to mirtazapine versus any other antidepressive agent. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data on an intention‐to‐treat basis. The primary outcome was response to treatment. The secondary outcomes included dropouts and individual adverse events. Meta‐analyses were conducted using the random‐effects model. Main results A total of 29 RCTs (n = 4974), mostly following up the participants for six weeks in outpatient clinics and inadequately reporting the risk of bias, were included. In comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (10 trials, n = 1553) there was no robust evidence to detect a difference between mirtazapine and tricyclics in terms of response at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.13) or at the end of acute‐phase treatment (at 6 to 12 weeks) (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.10). In comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (12 trials, n = 2626) mirtazapine was significantly more effective at two weeks (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.88) and at the end of acute‐phase treatment (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39). Mirtazapine was significantly more effective than a serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine only, two trials, n = 415) at two weeks (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.59) and at the end of acute‐phase treatment (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.25). In terms of dropouts, there was no robust evidence to detect a difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants. Mirtazapine was more likely to cause weight gain or increased appetite and somnolence than SSRIs but less likely to cause nausea or vomiting and sexual dysfunction. Authors' conclusions Some statistically significant and possibly clinically meaningful differences between mirtazapine and other antidepressive agents were found for the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Mirtazapine is likely to have a faster onset of action than SSRIs during the acute‐phase treatment. Dropouts occur similarly in participants treated with mirtazapine and those treated with other antidepressants, although the adverse event profile of mirtazapine is unique. Plain language summary Mirtazapine versus other antidepressive agents for depression Major depression is characterised by a persistent low mood and loss of interest and pleasure. These symptoms are often accompanied by loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration, inappropriate guilty feelings and even suicide. Depression was the third leading cause of disease burden among all diseases experienced by humankind in 2002. Antidepressants are used in treatment for major depression. They are the mainstay of treatment. Among them, mirtazapine is known to have a unique pharmacological profile and thus is supposed to differ in its efficacy and adverse effects profile in comparison with other antidepressants. The evidence from this review, which included findings from 29 randomised controlled trials (4974 participants in total), suggests that mirtazapine is likely to have a faster onset of action than the most frequently used type of antidepressants, which are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It would appear that mirtazapine is superior to SSRIs at the end of treatment over 6 to 12 weeks. Mirtazapine causes adverse events that lead to a similar frequency of dropouts as SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, although adverse event profile of mirtazapine is unique. Mirtazapine is likely to cause weight gain or increased appetite and somnolence but is less likely to cause nausea or vomiting and sexual dysfunction than SSRIs.

AB: Abstract - Background Clozapine is widely used for people with schizophrenia. Although agranulocytosis, weight gain, and cardiac problems are serious problems associated with its use, hypersalivation, sometimes of a gross and socially unacceptable quantity, is also common (30‐80%). Objectives To determine the clinical effects of pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced hypersalivation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials, contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions, at any dose and by any route of administration, for clozapine‐induced hypersalivation. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data (homogenous) we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We calculated weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data. Main results Of the 15 trials identified, 14 were conducted in China and 14 in hospitals. The quality of reporting was poor with no studies clearly describing allocation concealment and much data were missing or unusable. All results are vulnerable to considerable bias. Most frequently the primary outcome was the diameter of the wet patch on the pillow. Antimuscarinics (astemizole, diphenhydramine, propantheline, doxepin) were the most commonly evaluated drugs. For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement' astemizole and diphenhydramine were more effective than placebo (astemizole: n=97, 2 RCTs, RR 0.61 CI 0.47 to 0.81 NNT 3 CI 2 to 5; diphenhydramine: n=131, 2 RCTs, RR 0.43 CI 0.31 to 0.58, NNT 2 CI 1.5 to 2.5), but the doses of astemizole used were those that can cause toxicity. Data involving propantheline were heterogeneous (I2= 86.6%), but both studies showed benefit over placebo. Adverse effects were poorly recorded. Of the other interventions, oryzanol (rice bran oil and rice embryo oil extract) showed benefit over the antimuscarinic doxepin in terms of 'no clinically important change' (n=104, 1 RCT, RR 0.45 CI 0.27 to 0.75, NNT 4 CI 2 to 7). The Chinese medicine  suo quo wan  (comprises spicebush root, Chinese yam and bitter cardamom) showed benefit over doxepin (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 'no clinically important change' 0.31 CI 0.16 to 0.59, NNT 3 CI 1.5 to 3.7). Authors' conclusions There are currently insufficient data to confidently inform clinical practice. The limitations of these studies are plentiful and the risk of bias is high. These trials, however, are invaluable guides for current and future study design. Well conducted randomised trials are possible. Some may be underway. Current practice outside of well designed randomised trials should be clearly justified. Plain language summary Interventions for people with schizophrenia who have too much saliva due to clozapine treatment Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, a mental health problem that can cause symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and social withdrawal. Clozapine may be useful in those for whom other medications have not worked very well. One of the common side‐effects of clozapine is having too much saliva in the mouth (hypersalivation). This can be embarrassing in public and problematic, especially at night. This review is about ways of reducing this problem and includes 15 trials containing 964 people, most of which were done in hospitals in China. Treatments included medications that had previously been useful for this problem or were thought to work in theory. The medications used were from a group of drugs called antimuscarinics, traditional Chinese medicines or others. The trials were short (all four weeks or less). From these trials the antimuscarinics; astemizole, diphenhydramine and propantheline, were shown to be better than placebo at reducing hypersalivation. Another medication called oryzanol and a Chinese traditional medicine called  Suo quo wan  were found to have benefit over doxepin, an antimuscarinic. However, because of the shortness of the trials, poor reporting and the limitations of design, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these results.      (Plain language summary prepared for this review by Janey Antoniou of RETHINK, UK,  www.rethink.org )

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with mental, neurological and substance‐use disorders (MNS) do not receive health care. Non‐specialist health workers (NSHWs) and other professionals with health roles (OPHRs) are a key strategy for closing the treatment gap. Objectives To assess the effect of NSHWs and OPHRs delivering MNS interventions in primary and community health care in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register) (searched 21 June 2012); MEDLINE, OvidSP; MEDLINE In Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, OvidSP; EMBASE, OvidSP (searched 15 June 2012); CINAHL, EBSCOhost; PsycINFO, OvidSP (searched 18 and 19 June 2012); World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Library (searched 29 June 2012); LILACS; the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO); OpenGrey; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (searched 8 and 9 August 2012); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (ISI Web of Knowledge) (searched 2 October 2012) and reference lists, without language or date restrictions. We contacted authors for additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted‐time‐series studies of NSHWs/OPHR‐delivered interventions in primary/community health care in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and intended to improve outcomes in people with MNS disorders and in their carers. We defined an NSHW as any professional health worker (e.g. doctors, nurses and social workers) or lay health worker without specialised training in MNS disorders. OPHRs included people outside the health sector (only teachers in this review). Data collection and analysis Review authors double screened, double data‐extracted and assessed risk of bias using standard formats. We grouped studies with similar interventions together. Where feasible, we combined data to obtain an overall estimate of effect. Main results The 38 included studies were from seven low‐ and 15 middle‐income countries. Twenty‐two studies used lay health workers, and most addressed depression or post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The review shows that the use of NSHWs, compared with usual healthcare services: 1. may increase the number of  adults who recover from depression or anxiety, or both,  two to six months after treatment (prevalence of depression: risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.64; low‐quality evidence); 2. may slightly reduce symptoms for  mothers with perinatal depression  (severity of depressive symptoms: standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.58 to ‐0.26; low‐quality evidence); 3. may slightly reduce the symptoms of  adults with PTSD  (severity of PTSD symptoms: SMD ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.67 to ‐0.05; low‐quality evidence); 4. probably slightly improves the symptoms of  people with dementia  (severity of behavioural symptoms: SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.60 to 0.08; moderate‐quality evidence); 5. probably improves/slightly improves the mental well‐being, burden and distress of  carers of people with dementia  (carer burden: SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐0.84 to ‐0.15; moderate‐quality evidence); 6. may decrease the amount of alcohol consumed by  people with alcohol‐use disorders  (drinks/drinking day in last 7 to 30 days: mean difference ‐1.68, 95% CI ‐2.79 to ‐0.57); low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether lay health workers or teachers reduce PTSD symptoms among children. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions about the cost‐effectiveness of using NSHWs or teachers, or about their impact on people with other MNS conditions. In addition, very few studies measured adverse effects of NSHW‐led care ‐ such effects could impact on the appropriateness and quality of care. Authors' conclusions Overall, NSHWs and teachers have some promising benefits in improving people's outcomes for general and perinatal depression, PTSD and alcohol‐use disorders, and patient‐ and carer‐outcomes for dementia. However, this evidence is mostly low or very low quality, and for some issues no evidence is available. Therefore, we cannot make conclusions about which specific NSHW‐led interventions are more effective. Plain language summary The effect of non‐specialist health workers on people with mental, neurological and substance‐abuse disorders in developing countries Background In developing countries, most people with mental, neurological and substance‐abuse (MNS) disorders do not receive adequate care mainly because of a lack of mental health professionals. Non‐specialist health workers, but also other professionals with health roles, such as teachers, may therefore have an important role to play in delivering MNS health care. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration carried out a review of the effects of using non‐specialist health workers or other professionals with health roles to help people with MNS disorders in developing countries. After searching for all relevant studies in scientific databases, they found 38 studies published before October 2012. Their findings are summarised below. What is a non‐specialist health worker? Any type of health worker (like a doctor, nurse or lay health worker) who is not a specialist in mental health or neurology but who may have had some training in these fields. We also looked at teachers, as they can be particularly important in the care of children and youths. What the research says The studies in this review were from 22 developing countries. In most studies, lay health workers delivered the mental health care, and addressed depression or anxiety (or both), or post‐traumatic stress disorder. The review shows that the use of non‐specialist health workers, compared with usual healthcare services: · may increase the number of  adults who recover from depression or anxiety (or both)  two to six months after treatment; · may slightly reduce symptoms for mothers with depression; · may slightly reduce the symptoms of  adults with post‐traumatic stress disorder  (non‐specialists and teachers were used in one study); · probably slightly improves the symptoms of  people with dementia ; · probably improves/slightly improves the mental well‐being, burden and distress of  carers of people with dementia ; · may decrease the quantity of alcohol consumed by  problem drinkers . It is uncertain whether lay health workers or teachers reduce post‐traumatic stress disorder symptoms among children . There were too few studies to draw any conclusions about the cost‐effectiveness of using non‐specialist health workers or teachers, or about their impact on people with other MNS conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and alcohol and drug abuse problems. In addition, very few studies measured unintended consequences of non‐specialist health worker‐led care ‐ such effects could impact on the appropriateness and quality of care. Quality of the evidence Overall, non‐specialist health workers and teachers have some promising benefits in improving people's outcomes for general and perinatal depression, post‐traumatic stress disorder and alcohol‐use disorders, and patient and carer outcomes for dementia. However, this evidence is of low or very low quality in some areas, and for some issues no evidence is available. Therefore, we cannot make conclusions about which specific interventions using non‐specialist health workers to help people with MNS disorders are more effective.

AB: Abstract - Background Tricyclic antidepressants are still extensively prescribed worldwide. Evidence for the recommended dosage of tricyclics, however, is poor. Objectives To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression. Search methods Electronic search of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966‐), EMBASE (1980‐), CINAHL (1982‐), PsycLIT (1974‐), PSYNDEX (1977‐) and LILACS (1982‐1999) and hand searches of major psychiatric and medical journals. Reference search and SciSearch of the identified studies. Personal contact with authors of significant papers. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials 1) comparing low dosage TCA (=< 100 mg/d on average at the end of trial) with placebo or 2) comparing low and standard dosages of the same TCA, in acute phase treatment of depressive disorder Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers examined eligibility of the identified studies, and extracted data for outcomes at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6‐8 weeks and later. Main outcome measures were relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors' definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression according to the last‐observation‐carried‐forward intention‐to‐treat method, and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Other outcome measures included worst‐case‐scenario intention‐to‐treat analysis of response as defined above (in which dropouts were considered non‐responders in the active treatment group and as responders in the comparison group), and standardised weighted mean scores of continuous depression severity scales (usually calculated by last‐observation‐carried‐forward method). Main results 35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6‐8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics. Authors' conclusions Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of varying dosages. Plain language summary Low dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for depression Practicing physicians and psychiatrists have often been criticised for administering too low a dosage of tricyclic antidepressants for people with depression. This systematic review of 39 studies (2564 participants) found that tricyclic antidepressants between 75‐100 mg/day and possibly below this range result in more reduction in depression than placebo. On the other hand, there was no strong evidence to show that standard dosage tricyclic brings about more response than low dosage tricyclic. The findings suggest that administration of low dosage tricyclic antidepressant is a defensible practice.

AB: Abstract - Background Treating the 20‐30% of people with schizophrenia whose symptoms are resistant to treatment can be problematic. Adding lamotrigine to ongoing antipsychotic treatment has shown to be of benefit in preliminary studies. Objectives To evaluate the effects of adjuvant lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2006) and inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all clinical randomised trials comparing lamotrigine with placebo or other antipsychotic augmentation strategies. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We found five relevant trials (total n=537), but no usable data on service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment or economic outcomes. Overall, reporting of data was poor. Those data we were able to use suggested that equal proportions of people allocated lamotrigine or placebo had no global response (n=208, 1 RCT, RR 1.06 CI 0.73 to 1.54). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of people whose mental state did not improve (n=297, 3 RCT, RR 1.26 CI 0.81 to 1.97). There was, however, a significant reduction in the PANSS total scores (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD ‐16.88 CI ‐8.57 to ‐25.18, p=0.0001), positive symptom sub‐scale scores (n=65, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐5.10 CI ‐8.86 to ‐1.34) and negative symptom sub‐scale scores (n=67, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐5.25, CI ‐7.07 to ‐3.43). Most cognitive measures showed no differences (n=329, 2 RCTs, RR not attaining BACS composite score of 0.5 1.10 CI 0.59 to 2.04). The proportion of participants leaving studies was about 25% at 12 weeks (n=537, 5 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.71 to 1.29). The lamotrigine group did experience the outcome of any adverse effects significantly more frequent than people allocated placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 1.02 to 1.38, NNH 10 CI 5 to 90). Among the many effects listed, only nausea was found to be significantly more (9%) in the lamotrigine group compared with placebo (n=465, 3 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 1.05 to 4.88). Authors' conclusions Evidence for use of lamotrigine as an adjuvant for people with schizophrenia is not robust and large well‐designed, conducted and reported real‐world randomised trials are needed to determine its place in everyday clinical practice. Plain language summary Lamotrigine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder affecting about 1% of the general population. The symptoms of the disorder significantly affect the social, occupational and interpersonal functioning of the affected person. In spite of promising treatments for schizophrenia over the last fifty years, at least one‐fifth to one‐third of affected people fail to respond to treatment. In such cases, additional drugs may be administered to improve treatment response. One such drug is lamotrigine, which was introduced primarily for epilepsy ('fits'). So far there has not been any systematic analysis of those reports that have suggested the benefit of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia, hence we undertook this review. We searched major medical databases for studies that have examined the use of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia. We identified five relevant studies that were conducted according to existing standards of research. A total of 537 people with schizophrenia participated in these five studies. The participants were resistant to various degrees to usual treatments and were randomised to receive either lamotrigine or placebo in addition to their usual drugs. The data regarding effectiveness could only be usefully analysed in less than 70 participants. Lamotrigine was considered to be effective if the questionnaire scores showed a greater reduction than for those who received placebo. The magnitude of this effect was small when compared to placebo. Data regarding adverse effects were available from three studies. There was a higher occurrence of nausea in those receiving lamotrigine. Apart from this the common side effects were headache and dizziness. The current evidence does not suggest that the addition of lamotrigine is a remarkable strategy for people with resistant schizophrenia, but the results are suggestive of a positive effect on the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, more studies with larger number of participants are needed to confirm the true magnitude of benefit and safety. This review is limited by the poor presentation of data from the individual studies.

AB: Abstract - Background Parent‐infant psychotherapy (PIP) is a dyadic intervention that works with parent and infant together, with the aim of improving the parent‐infant relationship and promoting infant attachment and optimal infant development. PIP aims to achieve this by targeting the mother’s view of her infant, which may be affected by her own experiences, and linking them to her current relationship to her child, in order to improve the parent‐infant relationship directly. Objectives 1. To assess the effectiveness of PIP in improving parental and infant mental health and the parent‐infant relationship. 2. To identify the programme components that appear to be associated with more effective outcomes and factors that modify intervention effectiveness (e.g. programme duration, programme focus). Search methods We searched the following electronic databases on 13 January 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Citation Index, ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched the  meta Register of Controlled Trials, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors and other experts. Selection criteria Two review authors assessed study eligibility independently. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (quasi‐RCT) that compared a PIP programme directed at parents with infants aged 24 months or less at study entry, with a control condition (i.e. waiting‐list, no treatment or treatment‐as‐usual), and used at least one standardised measure of parental or infant functioning. We also included studies that only used a second treatment group. Data collection and analysis We adhered to the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference (MD) in post‐intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation. We presented standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data. We undertook meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Main results We included eight studies comprising 846 randomised participants, of which four studies involved comparisons of PIP with control groups only. Four studies involved comparisons with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video‐interaction guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. Samples included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias). Four studies were at low risk of bias in four or more domains. Four studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, and no study blinded participants or personnel to the intervention. Five studies did not provide adequate information for assessment of risk of bias in at least one domain (rated as unclear). Six studies contributed data to the PIP versus control comparisons producing 19 meta‐analyses of outcomes measured at post‐intervention or follow‐up, or both, for the primary outcomes of parental depression (both dichotomous and continuous data); measures of parent‐child interaction (i.e. maternal sensitivity, child involvement and parent engagement; infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, disorganised, resistant); attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and secondary outcomes (e.g. infant cognitive development). The results favoured neither PIP nor control for incidence of parental depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, 3 studies, 278 participants, low quality evidence) or parent‐reported levels of depression (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.02, 4 studies, 356 participants, low quality evidence). There were improvements favouring PIP in the proportion of infants securely attached at post‐intervention (RR 8.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 63.70, 2 studies, 168 participants, very low quality evidence); a reduction in the number of infants with an avoidant attachment style at post‐intervention (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); fewer infants with disorganised attachment at post‐intervention (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.58, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); and an increase in the proportion of infants moving from insecure to secure attachment at post‐intervention (RR 11.45, 95% CI 3.11 to 42.08, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence). There were no differences between PIP and control in any of the meta‐analyses for the remaining primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes. Four studies contributed data at post‐intervention or follow‐up to the PIP versus alternative treatment analyses producing 15 meta‐analyses measuring parent mental health (depression); parent‐infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, resistant, disorganised) and attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and infant cognitive development. None of the remaining meta‐analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes. We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression and secure or disorganised infant attachment. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial. The included studies also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes. Authors' conclusions Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high‐risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment‐as‐usual for other parent‐based or relationship‐based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent‐infant interaction. Plain language summary Parent‐infant psychotherapy for improving parent and infant well‐being Background Parent‐infant psychotherapy (PIP) is intended to address problems in the parent‐infant relationship, and problems such as excessive crying and sleeping/eating difficulties. A parent‐infant psychotherapist works directly with the parent and infant in the home or clinic, to identify unconscious patterns of relating and behaving, and influences from the past that are impeding the parent‐infant relationship. Parents may be referred to this service (e.g. by a general practitioner in the UK) or may self refer to privately run services. The intervention is delivered to individual dyads but can also be delivered to small groups of parents and infants. Review question This review examined whether PIP is effective in improving the parent‐infant relationship, or other aspects of parent or infant functioning, and to identify the programme components that appear to be associated with more effective outcomes and factors that modify intervention effectiveness (e.g. programme duration, programme focus). Study characteristics We searched electronic databases and identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs, where participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) and one cluster randomised trial (where prisons rather than participants were used as the unit of randomisation), in which participants had been allocated to a receive PIP versus a control group, and which reported results using at least one standard measure of outcome (i.e. an instrument which has been tested to ensure that it reliably measures the outcome under investigation). Evidence is current to 13 January 2014. We identified eight studies with 846 randomised participants comparing either PIP with a no‐treatment control group (four studies) or comparing PIP with other types of treatment (four studies). Key results The studies comparing PIP with a no‐treatment control group contributed data to 19 meta‐analyses of the primary outcomes of parental mental health (depression), parent‐infant interaction outcomes of maternal sensitivity (i.e. the extent to which the caregiver responds in a timely and attuned manner), child involvement and parent positive engagement, and infant outcomes of infant attachment category (the infant's ability to seek and maintain closeness to primary caregiver ‐ infant attachment is classified as follows: 'secure' infant attachment is a positive outcome, which indicates that the infant is able to be comforted when distressed and is able to use the parent as a secure base from which to explore the environment. Infants who are insecurely attached are either 'avoidant' (i.e. appear not to need comforting when they are distressed and attempt to manage the distress themselves); or 'resistant' (i.e. unable to be comforted when distressed and alternate between resistance and anger). Children who are defined as ‘disorganised’ are unable to produce a coherent strategy in the face of distress and produce behaviour that is a mixture of approach and avoidance to the caregiver); and the secondary outcomes of infant behaviour and infant cognitive development (i.e. intellectual development, including thinking, problem solving and communicating). In our analyses, parents who received PIP were more likely to have an infant who was securely emotionally attached to the parent after the intervention; this a favourable outcome but there is very low quality evidence to support it. The studies comparing PIP with another model of treatment contributed data to 15 meta‐analysis assessments of primary outcomes, including parental mental health, parent‐infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment and infant behaviour, or secondary infant outcomes such as infant cognitive development. None of these comparisons showed differences that favoured either PIP or the alternative intervention. None of the comparisons of PIP with either a control or comparison treatment group showed adverse changes for any outcome. We conclude that although PIP appears to be a promising method of improving infant attachment security, there is no evidence about its benefits in terms of other outcomes, and no evidence to show that it is more effective than other types of treatment for parents and infants. Further research is needed. Quality of the evidence The included studies were unclear about important quality criteria, had limitations in terms of their design or methods, or we judged that there was risk of bias in the trial. This lower quality evidence gives us less confidence in the observed effects.

AB: Abstract - Background Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia and this has serious implications for health and well being. Objectives To determine the effects of both pharmacological (excluding medication switching) and non pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (April 2006), reference sections within relevant papers, hand searched key journals, and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information. Selection criteria We included all clinical randomised controlled trials comparing any pharmacological or non pharmacological intervention for weight gain (diet and exercise counselling) with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from studies. As weight is a continuous outcome measurement, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the change from baseline were calculated. The primary outcome measure was weight loss. Main results Twenty‐three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Five trials assessed a cognitive/behavioural intervention and eighteen assessed a pharmacological adjunct. In terms of prevention, two cognitive/behavioural trials showed significant treatment effect (mean weight change) at end of treatment (n=104, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐3.38 kg CI ‐4.2 to ‐2.0). Pharmacological adjunct treatments were significant with a modest prevention of weight gain (n=274, 6 RCTs, WMD ‐ 1.16 kg CI ‐1.9 to ‐0.4). In terms of treatments for weight loss, we found significantly greater weight reduction in the cognitive behavioural intervention group (n=129, 3 RCTs, WMD ‐1.69 kg CI ‐2.8 to ‐0.6) compared with standard care. Authors' conclusions Modest weight loss can be achieved with selective pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions. However, interpretation is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, short study duration and by variability of the interventions themselves, their intensity and duration. Future studies adequately powered, with longer treatment duration and rigorous methodology will be needed in further evaluating the efficacy and safety of weight loss interventions for moderating weight gain. At this stage, there is insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacological interventions for weight management in people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Interventions to reduce weight gain in schizophrenia Weight gain and obesity is a common problem for people with schizophrenia and both pharmacological (medication) and non pharmacological (diet/exercise) interventions have been tried to treat this problem. In this review we are able to show that small weight loss is possible with selective pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions but it is difficult to be sure of the results because the studies were small and compared different interventions over different time periods.

AB: Abstract - Background Psychosis is a serious mental condition characterised by a loss of contact with reality. There may be a prodromal period or stage of psychosis, where early signs of symptoms indicating onset of first episode psychosis (FEP) occur. A number of services, incorporating multimodal treatment approaches (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions), developed worldwide, now focus on this prodromal period with the aim of preventing psychosis in people at risk of developing FEP. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of early interventions for people in the prodromal stage of psychosis. The secondary objective is, if possible, to compare the effectiveness of the various different interventions. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based Register of studies (including trials registers) on 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for participants older than 12 years, who had developed a prodromal stage of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Main results We included 20 studies with 2151 participants. The studies analysed 13 different comparisons. Group A comparisons explored the absolute effects of the experimental intervention. Group B were comparisons within which we could not be clear whether differential interactive effects were also ongoing. Group C comparisons explored differential effects between clearly distinct treatments. A key outcome for this review was ‘transition to psychosis’. For details of other main outcomes please see 'Summary of findings' tables. In Group A (comparisons of absolute effects) we found no clear difference between amino acids and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). When omega‐3 fatty acids were compared to placebo, fewer participants given the omega‐3 (10%) transitioned to psychosis compared to the placebo group (33%) during long‐term follow‐up of seven years (RR 0.24 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 81 participants; low‐quality evidence). In Group B (comparisons where complex interactions are probable) and in the subgroup focusing on antipsychotic drugs added to specific care packages, the amisulpiride + needs‐focused intervention (NFI) compared to NFI comparison (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 102 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and the olanzapine + supportive intervention compared to supportive intervention alone comparison (RR 0.58 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 60 participants; very low‐quality evidence) showed no clear differences between groups. In the second Group B subgroup (cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT)), when CBT + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy group transitioned to psychosis during follow‐up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in the supportive therapy alone group (RR 0.45 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89; 2 RCTs, 252 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The CBT + risperidone versus CBT + placebo comparison identified no clear difference between treatments (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.39 to 2.67; 1 RCT, 87 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and this also applies to the CBT + needs‐based intervention (NBI) + risperidone versus NBI comparison (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.39 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 59 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Group C (differential effects) also involved six comparisons. The first compared CBT with supportive therapy. No clear difference was found for the ‘transition to psychosis’ outcome (RR 0.74 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98; 1 RCT, 72 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The second subgroup compared CBT + supportive intervention was compared with a NBI + supportive intervention, again, data were equivocal, few and of very low quality (RR 6.32 95% CI 0.34 to 117.09; 1 RCT, 57 participants). In the CBT + risperidone versus supportive therapy comparison, again there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; 1 RCT, 71 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The three other comparisons in Group C demonstrated no clear differences between treatment groups. When cognitive training was compared to active control (tablet games) (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 62 participants; very low quality data), family treatment compared with enhanced care comparison (RR 0.54 95% CI 0.18 to 1.59; 2 RCTs, 229 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and integrated treatment compared to standard treatment comparison (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 79 participants; very low‐quality evidence) no effects of any of these approaches was evident. Authors' conclusions There has been considerable research effort in this area and several interventions have been trialled. The evidence available suggests that omega‐3 fatty acids may prevent transition to psychosis but this evidence is low quality and more research is needed to confirm this finding. Other comparisons did not show any clear differences in effect for preventing transition to psychosis but again, the quality of this evidence is very low or low and not strong enough to make firm conclusions. Plain language summary Early interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis Review question Is there high‐quality evidence indicating that interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis are effective? Background Psychoses are serious mental conditions characterised by a loss of contact with reality. The first clear episode of psychosis can be preceded by a 'prodromal' period of at least six months, where a person experiences gradual non‐specific changes in thoughts, perceptions, behaviours and functioning. Although an individual is experiencing changes, they have not yet started to experience the more obvious psychotic symptoms such as delusions (fixed false beliefs) or hallucinations (perceptions without a cause). A number of services with treatment approaches that combine pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial treatments, developed worldwide, are now focusing on prevention of psychosis in people at risk by giving treatments during this prodromal period. This review assesses the evidence available concerning the effects of different treatment approaches for people not yet diagnosed with a non affective psychosis but who are in the prodromal stage of psychosis. Searching for evidence On 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017 we ran electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of studies in order to find clinical studies that randomly allocated individuals at risk of developing psychosis to receive various treatments for preventing development of psychosis. Evidence found We were able to include 20 studies with 2151 participants. These studies analysed a wide range of treatments. All the review findings are of, at very best, low quality. There is some suggestion from one small study that people at risk of psychosis may benefit from taking omega‐3 fatty acids in terms of reduced transition to psychosis. Other studies found adding antipsychotic drugs to supportive‐care packages did not seem to make much difference in terms of transition to full illness. When cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants treated allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy transitioned to psychosis during follow‐up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in people who just received supportive therapy. This could be important but these data are of very low quality. All other testing of CBT and other packages of care found no clear difference between treatments for transition to psychosis. Conclusions There has been considerable effort and expense invested testing treatment approaches for prevention of the first episode of schizophrenia. Currently, there is some low‐quality evidence suggesting that omega‐3 fatty acids may be effective, but there is no high‐quality evidence to suggest that any type of treatment is effective, and no firm conclusions can be made.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long‐term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. Objectives To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behaviour and assess safety. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018. Selection criteria We included all randomised, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  We rated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update. One trial was conducted in a community setting, eight in nursing homes and one in both settings. Different types of antipsychotics at varying doses were discontinued in the studies. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. Reported data were predominantly from studies at low or unclear risk of bias. We included nine trials with 575 randomised participants that used a proxy outcome for overall success of antipsychotic withdrawal. Pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Based on assessment of seven studies, discontinuation may make little or no difference to whether or not participants complete the study (low‐quality evidence). Two trials included only participants with psychosis, agitation or aggression who had responded to antipsychotic treatment. In these two trials, stopping antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of leaving the study early due to symptomatic relapse or a shorter time to symptomatic relapse. We found low‐quality evidence that discontinuation may make little or no difference to overall NPS, measured using various scales (7 trials, 519 participants). There was some evidence from subgroup analyses in two trials that discontinuation may reduce agitation for participants with less severe NPS at baseline, but may be associated with a worsening of NPS in participants with more severe NPS at baseline. None of the studies assessed withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects of antipsychotics (such as falls) were not systematically assessed. Low‐quality evidence showed that discontinuation may have little or no effect on adverse events (5 trials, 381 participants), quality of life (2 trials, 119 participants), or cognitive function (5 trials, 365 participants). There were insufficient data to determine whether discontinuation of antipsychotics has any effect on mortality (very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is low‐quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality. People with psychosis, aggression or agitation who responded well to long‐term antipsychotic drug use, or those with more severe NPS at baseline, may benefit behaviourally from continuation of antipsychotics. Discontinuation may reduce agitation for people with mild NPS at baseline. However, these conclusions are based on few studies or small subgroups and further evidence of benefits and harms associated with withdrawal of antipsychotic is required in people with dementia and mild and severe NPS. The overall conclusions of the review have not changed since 2013 and the number of available trials remains low. Plain language summary Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia Review question We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. Background People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. Methods We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. Results We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. Quality of the evidence Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. Conclusions Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low.

AB: Abstract - Background Supportive therapy is often used in everyday clinical care and in evaluative studies of other treatments. Objectives To review the effects of supportive therapy compared with standard care, or other treatments in addition to standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (November 2012). Selection criteria All randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and comparing supportive therapy with any other treatment or standard care. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality rated these and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated the risk ratio (RR) using a fixed‐effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we undertook intention‐to‐treat analyses. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) fixed‐effect with 95% CIs. We estimated heterogeneity (I 2  technique) and publication bias. We used GRADE to rate quality of evidence. Main results Four new trials were added after the 2012 search. The review now includes 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants. Overall, the evidence was  very low quality . We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatments over supportive therapy. These included hospitalisation rates (4 RCTs, n = 306, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.99,  very low quality of evidence ), clinical improvement in mental state (3 RCTs, n = 194, RR 1.27 CI 1.04 to 1.54,  very low quality of evidence ) and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care (1 RCT, n = 45, RR 3.19 CI 1.01 to 10.7,  very low quality of evidence ). For this comparison, we found no evidence of significant differences for rate of relapse, leaving the study early and quality of life. When we compared supportive therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy CBT), we again found no significant differences in primary outcomes. There were very limited data to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation, and no studies provided data regarding clinically important change in general functioning, one of our primary outcomes of interest. Authors' conclusions There are insufficient data to identify a difference in outcome between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy but these findings are based on a few small studies where we graded the evidence as  very low quality . Future research would benefit from larger trials that use supportive therapy as the main treatment arm rather than the comparator. Plain language summary Supportive therapy for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with ‘positive symptoms’ such as hallucinations (hearing voices and seeing things) and delusions (having strange beliefs). People with schizophrenia also suffer from disorganisation and ‘negative symptoms’ (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). People with schizophrenia may find it hard to socialise and find employment. Schizophrenia is considered one of the most burdensome illnesses in the world. For some people it can be a lifelong condition. Most people with schizophrenia will be given antipsychotic medications to help relieve the symptoms. In addition to this they can also receive therapy, of which there are various types.    One therapy often given to people with schizophrenia is supportive therapy, where typically after a person is established in the care of mental health services, they will receive general support rather than specific talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). For example, in consultations with health professionals there will often be time given to listening to people’s concerns, providing encouragement, or even arranging basic help with daily living. Many people with schizophrenia also receive support from their family and friends. Supportive therapy has been described as the treatment of choice for most people with mental illness and may be one of the most commonly practiced therapies in mental health services. It is, however, difficult to answer the question of exactly what supportive therapy is. It is difficult to find a widely accepted definition of supportive therapy. For the purposes of this review, supportive therapy includes any intervention from a single person aimed at maintaining a person’s existing situation or assisting in people’s coping abilities. This includes interventions that require a trained therapist, such as supportive psychotherapy, as well as other interventions that require no training, such as 'befriending'. Supportive therapy does not include interventions that seek to educate, train or change a person’s way of coping. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of supportive therapy compared to other specific therapies or treatment as usual. This update is based on a search run in 2012; the review now includes 24 randomised studies with a total of 2126 people. The studies compared supportive therapy either with standard care alone or a range of other therapies such as CBT, family therapy and psychoeducation. The participants continued to receive their antipsychotic medication and any other treatment they would normally receive during the trials. Overall, the quality of evidence from these studies was very low. There is not enough information or data to identify any real therapeutic difference between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation, satisfaction with treatment and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy. However, these findings are limited because they are based on only a few small studies where the quality of evidence is very low. There was very limited information to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation as most studies in this review focused on other psychological therapies, such as CBT. Apart from one study presenting data on death, there was no information on the adverse effects of supportive therapy. In summary, there does not seem to be much difference between supportive therapy, standard care and other therapies. Future research would benefit from larger studies where supportive therapy is the main treatment. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation:  http://mcpin.org/

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial treatment that aims to help individuals re‐evaluate their appraisals of their experiences that can affect their level of distress and problematic behaviour. CBT is now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an add‐on treatment for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Other psychosocial therapies that are often less expensive are also available as an add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia. This review is also part of a family of Cochrane Reviews on CBT for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To assess the effects of CBT compared with other psychosocial therapies as add‐on treatments for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study Based Register of Trials (latest 6 March, 2017). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with schizophrenia who were randomly allocated to receive, in addition to their standard care, either CBT or any other psychosocial therapy. Outcomes of interest included relapse, global state, mental state, adverse events, social functioning, quality of life and satisfaction with treatment. We included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We reliably screened references and selected trials. Review authors, working independently, assessed trials for methodological quality and extracted data from included studies. We analysed dichotomous data on an intention‐to‐treat basis and continuous data with 60% completion rate. Where possible, for binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed‐effect model for analyses unless there was unexplained high heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table for our main outcomes of interest. Main results The review now includes 36 trials with 3542 participants, comparing CBT with a range of other psychosocial therapies that we classified as either active (A) (n = 14) or non active (NA) (n = 14). Trials were often small and at high or unclear risk of bias. When CBT was compared with other psychosocial therapies, no difference in long‐term relapse was observed (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 375; studies = 5,  low‐quality evidence ). Clinically important change in global state data were not available but data for rehospitalisation were reported. Results showed no clear difference in long term rehospitalisation (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.14; participants = 943; studies = 8,  low‐quality evidence ) nor in long term mental state (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; participants = 249; studies = 4,  low‐quality evidence ). No long‐term differences were observed for death (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.98; participants = 627; studies = 6,  low‐quality evidence ). Only average endpoint scale scores were available for social functioning and quality of life. Social functioning scores were similar between groups (long term Social Functioning Scale (SFS): MD 8.80, 95% CI ‐4.07 to 21.67; participants = 65; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ), and quality of life scores were also similar (medium term Modular System for Quality of Life (MSQOL): MD ‐4.50, 95% CI ‐15.66 to 6.66; participants = 64; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ). There was a modest but clear difference favouring CBT for satisfaction with treatment ‐ measured as leaving the study early (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; participants = 2392; studies = 26,  low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Evidence based on data from randomised controlled trials indicates there is no clear and convincing advantage for cognitive behavioural therapy over other ‐ and sometimes much less sophisticated and expensive ‐ psychosocial therapies for people with schizophrenia. It should be noted that although much research has been carried out in this area, the quality of evidence available is mainly low or of very low quality. Good quality research is needed before firm conclusions can be made. Plain language summary Is Cognitive behavioural therapy as effective as other psychosocial treatments for people with schizophrenia Background People with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can experience severe disturbances in their thought processes, which may lead to delusions (beliefs that are not based on reality) and hallucinations (seeing and hearing things that are not really there). The standard care for people with schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, but these medications are not always successful on their own and additional treatments such as psychosocial therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) are recommended for people with schizophrenia. CBT aims to help people re‐evaluate their views of their symptoms. This process is thought to help reduce distress and change behaviours. It is often used to help people with illnesses such as anxiety and depression. However, CBT is expensive and the evidence for its effectiveness is not clear, particularly for people with schizophrenia. Searches The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their specialised register for trials that allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either CBT or another type of psychosocial treatment, up to March 2017. These searches found 4117 records. The review authors inspected and screened these records. Main results Thirty‐six randomised controlled trials, randomising in total 3542 people with schizophrenia could be included. The quality of evidence from these trials is very low to low. For important outcomes such as relapse, rehospitalisation, mental state, death, social functioning, quality of life no real differences were found between CBT compared with other psychosocial treatments. The number of participants leaving the study early was used as an indirect measure for satisfaction with treatment. Slightly more people allocated to other psychosocial treatments groups left early compared to CBT groups. Results were not robust enough to make firm conclusions. Conclusions No firm conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness of CBT compared to other psychosocial treatments for people with schizophrenia until results from further good‐quality trials are available.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is the most common psychological problem in the dialysis population. The diagnosis of depression in dialysis patients is confounded by the fact that several symptoms of uraemia mimic the somatic components of depression. It affects the physical, psychological and social well being of the dialysis population in several ways. Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of depression in patients who are dialysed for end‐stage renal disease. Search methods A comprehensive search strategy was employed to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the treatment of depression in dialysis patients. The following databases were searched ‐ MEDLINE (1966 ‐ October 2003), EMBASE (1980 ‐ October 2003), PsycINFO (1872 ‐ October 2003) and  The Cochrane Library  (issue 3, 2003). Authors of potential studies were contacted, reference lists of identified RCTs and relevant narrative reviews were screened. Selection criteria RCTs comparing any psychosocial intervention with control intervention or no intervention in depressed dialysis patients. Data collection and analysis Data were to be abstracted by two investigators independently onto a standard form and entered into Review Manager. Risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data were to be calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Despite extensive searching, no RCTs were identified. Authors' conclusions Data were not available to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of depression in the chronic dialysis population, as we did not find any RCTs of psychosocial interventions to treat depression in dialysis patients. This review highlights the need for commencing and completing adequately powered RCTs to address the issue of psychosocial interventions for depression in dialysis patients. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for treating depression in dialysis patients Depression is the most common psychological problem in the chronic dialysis population and it affects their physical, mental and social well‐being. The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) for treating depressed dialysis patients. No relevant randomised controlled trials were identified. Large, long‐term studies are needed in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Adjustment disorders are a frequent cause of sick leave and various interventions have been developed to expedite the return to work (RTW) of individuals on sick leave due to adjustment disorders. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions facilitating RTW for workers with acute or chronic adjustment disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to Issue 4, 2011; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science, all years to February 2011; the WHO trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov in March 2011. We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to facilitate RTW of workers with adjustment disorders compared to no or other treatment. Eligible interventions were pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and problem solving therapy), relaxation techniques, exercise programmes, employee assistance programmes or combinations of these interventions. The primary outcomes were time to partial and time to full RTW, and secondary outcomes were severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder, work functioning, generic functional status (i.e. the overall functional capabilities of an individual, such as physical functioning, social function, general mental health) and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies that we deemed sufficiently clinically homogeneous in different comparison groups, and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included nine studies reporting on 10 psychological interventions and one combined intervention. The studies included 1546 participants. No RCTs were found of pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. We assessed seven studies as having low risk of bias and the studies that were pooled together were comparable. For those who received no treatment, compared with CBT, the assumed time to partial and full RTW was 88 and 252 days respectively. Based on two studies with a total of 159 participants, moderate‐quality evidence showed that CBT had similar results for time (measured in days) until partial RTW compared to no treatment at one‐year follow‐up (mean difference (MD) ‐8.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐23.26 to 5.71). We found low‐quality evidence of similar results for CBT and no treatment on the reduction of days until full RTW at one‐year follow‐up (MD ‐35.73, 95% CI ‐113.15 to 41.69) (one study with 105 participants included in the analysis). Based on moderate‐quality evidence, problem solving therapy (PST) significantly reduced time until partial RTW at one‐year follow‐up compared to non‐guideline based care (MD ‐17.00, 95% CI ‐26.48 to ‐7.52) (one study with 192 participants clustered among 33 treatment providers included in the analysis), but we found moderate‐quality evidence of no significant effect on reducing days until full RTW at one‐year follow‐up (MD ‐17.73, 95% CI ‐37.35 to 1.90) (two studies with 342 participants included in the analysis). Authors' conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that CBT did not significantly reduce time until partial RTW and low‐quality evidence that it did not significantly reduce time to full RTW compared with no treatment. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that PST significantly enhanced partial RTW at one‐year follow‐up compared to non‐guideline based care but did not significantly enhance time to full RTW at one‐year follow‐up. An important limitation was the small number of studies included in the meta‐analyses and the small number of participants, which lowered the power of the analyses. Plain language summary Improving return to work in adults suffering from symptoms of distress Adjustment disorders, characterised by distress symptoms and emotional disturbance as a reaction to a significant life change or stressful life event, are a frequent cause of sick leave among workers. Apart from the negative consequences for the worker, sick leave poses a heavy burden on society due to the loss of productivity of the worker and work disability claims. Different treatments have been developed to help such workers return to work. Our study assessed how effective these treatments are at enabling the sick‐listed worker to return to partial or full‐time work. We searched databases containing articles from different scientific journals and looked for studies that tested whether a certain type of treatment helped the worker to return to work when on sick leave because of an adjustment disorder. We found nine relevant studies. In total, 10 psychological treatments were evaluated and one combined treatment consisting of a psychological treatment and relaxation techniques. We found no studies on pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. The nine studies included in this review reported in total on 1546 participants. Of the 10 psychological treatments, five consisted of cognitive behavioural therapy and five of problem solving therapy, which are commonly used types of treatment for patients with mental health problems. Our results showed that workers on sick leave because of an adjustment disorder can be helped with making their first step back to work (i.e. partial return to work) by treating them with problem solving therapy. On average, workers who are offered problem solving therapy start 17 days earlier with partial return to work compared to workers who receive no treatment or the usual treatment from their occupational physician or general practitioner. However, we also found that cognitive behavioural therapy or problem solving therapy does not help the worker return to work with full‐time hours any quicker than workers who receive no treatment or the usual treatment from their occupational physicians or general practitioners. These results are based on moderate‐quality evidence, which implies that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the results and may change the results.

AB: Abstract - Background Massage and touch have been suggested as a non‐pharmacological alternative or supplement to other treatments offered in order to reduce or manage a range of conditions associated with dementia such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression. It has also been suggested that massage and touch may counteract cognitive decline. Objectives To assess the effects of a range of massage and touch therapies on conditions associated with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression, identify any adverse effects, and provide recommendations about future trials. Search methods We identified trials from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 12 July 2005 using the terms massage, reflexology, touch and shiatsu. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. In addition, general and specific literature databases were searched and patient and therapist organizations contacted. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which a massage or touch intervention was given to persons suffering from dementia of any type, compared with other treatments or no treatment, and in which effect parameters included measures of behavioural problems, caregiver burden, emotional distress or cognitive abilities, were eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, we employed a set of minimal methodological quality criteria as a selection filter. Data collection and analysis We identified 34 references in the initial searches. Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria. Main results The very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short‐term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified. Authors' conclusions Massage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia. More research is needed, however, to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of these interventions. Plain language summary Insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the possibility that massage and touch interventions are effective for dementia or associated problems Massage and touch interventions have been proposed as an alternative or supplement to pharmacological and other treatments to counteract anxiety, agitated behaviour, depression, and if possible to slow down cognitive decline in people with dementia. This review provides an overview of existing research on the use of massage for people with dementia. Eighteen studies of the effects of massage interventions were located, but only two small studies were of a sufficient methodological rigour to count as evidence to answer the question of effect. The small amount of evidence currently available is in favour of massage and touch interventions, but is too limited in scope to allow for general conclusions. Further, high‐quality randomized controlled trials are required.

AB: Abstract - Background Various psychological therapies for pathological and problem gambling have been evaluated in randomised trials. A synthesis of best‐quality evidence is required. Objectives The objective was to synthesise evidence from randomised trials of psychological therapies for pathological and problem gambling (cognitive‐behaviour therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing therapy, integrative therapy, other psychological therapy), in order to indicate the efficacy of therapies and durability of therapy effects, relative to control conditions. Search methods We conducted a search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) (all years), EMBASE (1974 ‐), MEDLINE (1950 ‐) and PsycINFO (1967 ‐). We also carried out complementary searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS and CENTRAL for studies published between January 1980 and October 2011. We examined the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov and also conducted manual searches of selected journals and reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria Included studies were clinical trials using random allocation to groups, considering pathological or problem gamblers, and evaluating a psychological therapy for pathological or problem gambling. Control conditions included 'no treatment' controls, referral to Gamblers Anonymous and non‐specific treatment component controls. Data collection and analysis We systematically extracted data on the characteristics and results of studies. Primary outcomes were measures of gambling symptom severity, financial loss from gambling and frequency of gambling. Secondary outcomes were occurrence of pathological gambling diagnoses and depression and anxiety symptoms. Treatment effects were defined by comparisons between therapy and control conditions at post‐treatment assessments (conducted from 0 to 3 months following completion of treatment) and follow‐up assessments (conducted from 9 to 12 months following completion of treatment), respectively, using the standardised mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio (RR). We synthesised results through random‐effects meta‐analysis. Main results Fourteen studies (n = 1245) met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies compared CBT with control and comparisons at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment showed beneficial effects of therapy that ranged from medium (when defined by financial loss from gambling: SMD ‐0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.71 to ‐0.33, n = 505) to very large (for gambling symptom severity: SMD ‐1.82; 95% CI ‐2.61 to ‐1.02, n = 402). Only one study (n = 147) compared groups at 9 to 12 months follow‐up and produced smaller effects that were not significant. Four studies of motivational interviewing therapy were identified and mainly considered samples demonstrating less severe gambling (relative to studies of pathological gamblers). Data suggested reduced financial loss from gambling following motivational interviewing therapy at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.41; 95% CI ‐0.75 to ‐0.07, n = 244), although comparisons on other outcomes were not significant. The effect approached zero when defined by gambling symptom severity (SMD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.50, n = 163). Studies compared groups at 9 to 12 months follow‐up and found a significant effect of motivational interviewing therapy in terms of frequency of gambling (SMD ‐0.53; 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.02, n = 62), with comparisons on other outcomes that were not significant. Two studies of integrative therapies also considered samples demonstrating overall low gambling severity, and found no significant effects of therapy at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment. Comparisons at 9 to 12 months follow‐up suggested a medium effect from therapy in terms of gambling symptom severity, with no significant differences for other outcomes. One study (n = 18) considered another psychological therapy (i.e.Twelve‐Step Facilitated Group Therapy) and suggested beneficial effects in terms of most outcomes at 0 to 3 months post‐treatment. The evidence supporting these various classes of therapy ranged from  very low  to  low  quality. Authors' conclusions This review supports the efficacy of CBT in reducing gambling behaviour and other symptoms of pathological and problem gambling immediately following therapy. However, the durability of therapeutic gain is unknown. There is preliminary evidence for some benefits from motivational interviewing therapy in terms of reduced gambling behaviour, although not necessarily other symptoms of pathological and problem gambling. However, the findings are based on few studies and additional research is needed to inform conclusions. There is also evidence suggestive of some possible benefit from integrative therapies, and other psychological therapies for pathological and problem gambling. However, there are too few studies and evidence is insufficient to evaluate these therapies. The majority of studies in this review varied in risk of bias, and much of the evidence comes from studies with multiple limitations. The current data may thus reflect overestimates of treatment efficacy. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for pathological and problem gambling Psychological therapies have been proposed for the treatment of pathological and problem gambling, and this review summarised current evidence for these therapies. It included best‐quality randomised trials, where therapy was compared with conditions including 'no treatment’ controls or referral to Gamblers Anonymous. It considered categories of therapy including: (1) cognitive‐behaviour therapy (CBT); (2) motivational interviewing therapy; (3) integrative therapy; and (4) other psychological therapy. The search identified 14 studies and we combined data from these. Data from nine studies indicated benefits of CBT in the period immediately following treatment. However, there were few studies across longer periods of time (e.g. 12 months) after treatment, and little is known about whether effects of CBT are lasting. Data from three studies of motivational interviewing therapy suggested some benefits in terms of reduced gambling behaviour, but not necessarily other symptoms of pathological and problem gambling. However, the data come from few studies and conclusions regarding motivational interviewing therapy require further research. There were also few studies that provided evidence on integrative therapies (two studies) and other psychological therapies (one study), and there is currently insufficient data to evaluate the efficacy of these therapies

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive impairment, a defining feature of dementia, plays an important role in the compromised functional independence that characterises the condition. Cognitive training (CT) is an approach that uses guided practice on structured tasks with the direct aim of improving or maintaining cognitive abilities. Objectives • To assess effects of CT on cognitive and non‐cognitive outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. • To compare effects of CT with those of other non‐pharmacological interventions, including cognitive stimulation or rehabilitation, for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. • To identify and explore factors related to intervention and trial design that may be associated with the efficacy of CT for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, on 5 July 2018. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified through monthly searches of several major healthcare databases and numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition to this, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's trials portal, ICTRP, to ensure that searches were comprehensive and up‐to‐date. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that described interventions for people with mild to moderate dementia and compared CT versus a control or alternative intervention. Data collection and analysis We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and through contact with trial authors if required. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We divided comparison conditions into active or passive control conditions and alternative treatments. We used a large number of measures and data to evaluate 19 outcomes at end of treatment, as well as 16 outcomes at follow‐up in the medium term; we pooled this information in meta‐analyses. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment effect using a random‐effects model, and we estimated statistical heterogeneity using a standard Chi² statistic. We graded the evidence using GradePro. Main results The 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel‐group, single‐site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as 'straight CT', but we classified some as 'augmented CT', and about two‐thirds as multi‐domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others. The methodological quality of studies varied, but we rated nearly all studies as having high or unclear risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment, and high or unclear risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. We used data from 32 studies in the meta‐analysis of at least one outcome. Relative to a control condition, we found moderate‐quality evidence showing a small to moderate effect of CT on our first primary outcome, composite measure of global cognition at end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.62), and high‐quality evidence showing a moderate effect on the secondary outcome of verbal semantic fluency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81) at end of treatment, with these gains retained in the medium term (3 to 12 months post treatment). In relation to many other outcomes, including our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term, the quality of evidence was very low, so we were unable to determine whether CT was associated with any meaningful gains. When compared with an alternative treatment, we found that CT may have little to no effect on our first primary outcome of global cognition at end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 0.64), but the quality of evidence was low. No evidence was available to assess our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term. We found moderate‐quality evidence showing that CT was associated with improved mood of the caregiver at end of treatment, but this was based on a single trial. The quality of evidence in relation to many other outcomes at end of treatment and in the medium term was too low for us to determine whether CT was associated with any gains, but we are moderately confident that CT did not lead to any gains in mood, behavioural and psychological symptoms, or capacity to perform activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions Relative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well‐established risks of bias, and should provide long‐term follow‐up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained. Future trials should also focus on direct comparison of CT versus alternative treatments rather than passive or active control conditions. Plain language summary Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia Background Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. Main findings We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. Limitations of this review The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.

AB: Abstract - Background People with severe mental illness show high rates of unemployment and work disability, however, they often have a desire to participate in employment. People with severe mental illness used to be placed in sheltered employment or were enrolled in prevocational training to facilitate transition to a competitive job. Now, there are also interventions focusing on rapid search for a competitive job, with ongoing support to keep the job, known as supported employment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining supported employment with other prevocational or psychiatric interventions. Objectives To assess the comparative effectiveness of various types of vocational rehabilitation interventions and to rank these interventions according to their effectiveness to facilitate competitive employment in adults with severe mental illness. Search methods In November 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and CINAHL, and reference lists of articles for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews. We identified systematic reviews from which to extract randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials and cluster‐randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of interventions on obtaining competitive employment for adults with severe mental illness. We included trials with competitive employment outcomes. The main intervention groups were prevocational training programmes, transitional employment interventions, supported employment, supported employment augmented with other specific interventions, and psychiatric care only. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently identified trials, performed data extraction, including adverse events, and assessed trial quality. We performed direct meta‐analyses and a network meta‐analysis including measurements of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). We assessed the quality of the evidence for outcomes within the network meta‐analysis according to GRADE. Main results We included 48 randomised controlled trials involving 8743 participants. Of these, 30 studied supported employment, 13 augmented supported employment, 17 prevocational training, and 6 transitional employment. Psychiatric care only was the control condition in 13 studies. Direct comparison meta‐analysis of obtaining competitive employment We could include 18 trials with short‐term follow‐up in a direct meta‐analysis (N = 2291) of the following comparisons. Supported employment was more effective than prevocational training (RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.24) and transitional employment (RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.77 to 6.89) and prevocational training was more effective than psychiatric care only (RR 8.96, 95% CI 1.77 to 45.51) in obtaining competitive employment. For the long‐term follow‐up direct meta‐analysis, we could include 22 trials (N = 5233). Augmented supported employment (RR 4.32, 95% CI 1.49 to 12.48), supported employment (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.68) and prevocational training (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.46) were more effective than psychiatric care only. Augmented supported employment was more effective than supported employment (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.65), transitional employment (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.55) and prevocational training (RR 5.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 27.11). Supported employment was more effective than transitional employment (RR 3.28, 95% CI 2.13 to 5.04) and prevocational training (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.89). Network meta‐analysis of obtaining competitive employment We could include 22 trials with long‐term follow‐up in a network meta‐analysis. Augmented supported employment was the most effective intervention versus psychiatric care only in obtaining competitive employment (RR 3.81, 95% CI 1.99 to 7.31, SUCRA 98.5, moderate‐quality evidence), followed by supported employment (RR 2.72 95% CI 1.55 to 4.76; SUCRA 76.5, low‐quality evidence). Prevocational training (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.19; SUCRA 40.3, very low‐quality evidence) and transitional employment were not considerably different from psychiatric care only (RR 1.00,95% CI 0.51 to 1.96; SUCRA 17.2, low‐quality evidence) in achieving competitive employment, but prevocational training stood out in the SUCRA value and rank. Augmented supported employment was slightly better than supported employment, but not significantly (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.14). The SUCRA value and mean rank were higher for augmented supported employment. The results of the network meta‐analysis of the intervention subgroups favoured augmented supported employment interventions, but also cognitive training. However, supported employment augmented with symptom‐related skills training showed the best results (RR compared to psychiatric care only 3.61 with 95% CI 1.03 to 12.63, SUCRA 80.3). We graded the quality of the evidence of the network ranking as very low because of potential risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency and publication bias. Direct meta‐analysis of maintaining competitive employment Based on the direct meta‐analysis of the short‐term follow‐up of maintaining employment, supported employment was more effective than: psychiatric care only, transitional employment, prevocational training, and augmented supported employment. In the long‐term follow‐up direct meta‐analysis, augmented supported employment was more effective than prevocational training (MD 22.79 weeks, 95% CI 15.96 to 29.62) and supported employment (MD 10.09, 95% CI 0.32 to 19.85) in maintaining competitive employment. Participants receiving supported employment worked more weeks than those receiving transitional employment (MD 17.36, 95% CI 11.53 to 23.18) or prevocational training (MD 11.56, 95% CI 5.99 to 17.13). We did not find differences between interventions in the risk of dropouts or hospital admissions. Authors' conclusions Supported employment and augmented supported employment were the most effective interventions for people with severe mental illness in terms of obtaining and maintaining employment, based on both the direct comparison analysis and the network meta‐analysis, without increasing the risk of adverse events. These results are based on moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence, meaning that future studies with lower risk of bias could change these results. Augmented supported employment may be slightly more effective compared to supported employment alone. However, this difference was small, based on the direct comparison analysis, and further decreased with the network meta‐analysis meaning that this difference should be interpreted cautiously. More studies on maintaining competitive employment are needed to get a better understanding of whether the costs and efforts are worthwhile in the long term for both the individual and society. Plain language summary Helping adults with severe mental illness get a job and to keep it, a network meta‐analysis What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out if it is possible to help adults with severe mental illness get a job and to keep it. People with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, are more often unemployed. However, these people still often have a desire to work. There are many ways to try and help them obtain a competitive job. People with severe mental illness used to be placed in sheltered employment or they were enrolled in prevocational training, before searching for competitive work. Now there are also interventions focusing directly on finding a job quickly, with ongoing support to keep the job. This is known as supported employment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining supported employment with other prevocational or psychiatric interventions. Key messages Supported employment and augmented supported employment are more effective than the other interventions in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment for people with severe mental illness without increasing the risk for hospital admissions. The difference in effectiveness between supported employment and augmented supported employment is small. Future research should evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of augmented supported employment compared to supported employment only. What was studied in the review? We included 48 randomised controlled trials involving 8743 participants. The interventions included prevocational training, transitional employment, such as sheltered jobs, supported employment, supported employment augmented with other specific interventions or psychiatric care only. We used the data from these studies about the number of participants who obtained a competitive job and the number of weeks they worked. Through a direct comparison meta‐analysis and a network meta‐analysis we assessed the difference in effectiveness between all interventions, and ranked these accordingly. What are the results of the review? Supported employment and augmented supported employment are more effective than prevocational training, transitional employment or psychiatric care only in obtaining employment in both types of meta‐analysis. In the direct comparison meta‐analysis prevocational training was also more effective than psychiatric care only. Augmented supported employment shows slightly better results than supported employment alone, again in both types of meta‐analysis. However, this result was less clear in the network meta‐analysis. In the subgroup analysis supported employment with symptom‐related skills training showed the best results. The results are based on moderate‐ to very low‐quality evidence, meaning that the results of future studies could change our conclusions. Augmented supported employment is more effective than prevocational training and supported employment in maintaining competitive employment in the direct comparison meta‐analysis. The results favour supported employment compared to transitional employment in maintaining competitive employment. Overall, we did not find any differences between interventions in the risk of participants dropping out or hospital admissions. How up to date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to 11 November 2016.

AB: Abstract - Background Despite a number of reviews advocating psychotherapy for the treatment of depression, there is relatively little evidence based on randomised controlled trials that specifically examines its efficacy in older people. Objectives To examine the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments for depression in older people. Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 11/9/2006. The International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Irish Journal of Psychiatry were handsearched. Reference lists of previous published systematic reviews, included/excluded trial articles and bibliographies were scrutinised.Experts in the field were contacted.. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that included older adults diagnosed as suffering from depression (ICD or DSM criteria) were included. All types of psychotherapeutic treatments were included, categorised into cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy and supportive therapies. Data collection and analysis Meta‐analysis was performed, using odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were a reduction in severity of depression, usually measured by clinician rated rating scales. Secondary outcomes, including dropout and life satisfaction, were also analysed. Main results The search identified nine trials of cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic therapy approaches, together with a small group of 'active control' interventions. No trials relating to other psychotherapeutic approaches and techniques were found. A total of seven trials provided sufficient data for inclusion in the comparison between CBT and controls. No trials compared psychodynamic psychotherapy with controls. Based on five trials (153 participants), cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than waiting list controls (WMD ‐9.85, 95% CI ‐11.97 to ‐7.73). Only three small trials compared psychodynamic therapy with CBT, with no significant difference in treatment effect indicated between the two types of psychotherapeutic treatment. Based on three trials with usable data, CBT was superior to active control interventions when using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (WMD ‐5.69, 95% CI ‐11.04 to ‐0.35), but equivalent when using the Geriatric Depression Scale (WMD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐5.31 to 1.32). Authors' conclusions Only a small number of studies and patients were included in the meta‐analysis. If taken on their own merit, the findings do not provide strong support for psychotherapeutic treatments in the management of depression in older people. However, the findings do reflect those of a larger meta‐analysis that included patients with broader age ranges, suggesting that CBT may be of potential benefit. Plain language summary Psychotherapeutic treatments for older depressed people Depression is a common problem facing older people and is often associated with loneliness, physical illness and pain. The condition can last for some years and causes considerable distress and illness. A significant majority of depressed elders do not receive treatment because of difficulty in recognition of the condition. Not only can it present with lowered mood but may also present with physical problems including sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, loss of interest, anxiety and lack of energy. Psychotherapy is recognised as a treatment for mild depression. In this review we included seven small trials, involving a total of 153 participants, that examined psychotherapeutic treatments for depression in older people. Five trials compared a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) against control conditions, and the findings showed that CBT was more effective than control. Two individual trials compared CBT against psychodynamic therapy, with no significant difference in effectiveness indicated between the two approaches. Our review shows that there is relatively little research in this field and care must be taken in generalising what evidence there is to clinical populations.

AB: Abstract - Background Anxiety disorders are characterised by long term worry, tension, nervousness, fidgeting and symptoms of autonomic system hyperactivity. Meditation is an age‐old self regulatory strategy which is gaining more interest in mental health and psychiatry. Meditation can reduce arousal state and may ameliorate anxiety symptoms in various anxiety conditions. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of meditation therapy in treating anxiety disorders Search methods Electronic databases searched include CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References, complementary and alternative medicine specific databases, Science Citation Index, Health Services/Technology Assessment Text database, and grey literature databases. Conference proceedings, book chapters and references were checked. Study authors and experts from religious/spiritual organisations were contacted. Selection criteria Types of studies: Randomised controlled trials.   Types of participants: patients with a diagnosis of anxiety disorders, with or without another comorbid psychiatric condition.   Types of interventions: concentrative meditation or mindfulness meditation.   Comparison conditions: one or combination of 1) pharmacological therapy 2) other psychological treatment 3) other methods of meditation 4) no intervention or waiting list.   Types of outcome: 1) improvement in clinical anxiety scale 2) improvement in anxiety level specified by triallists, or global improvement 3) acceptability of treatment, adverse effects 4) dropout. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using a pre‐designed data collection form. Any disagreements were discussed with a third reviewer, and the authors of the studies were contacted for further information. Main results Two randomised controlled studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Both studies were of moderate quality and used active control comparisons (another type of meditation, relaxation, biofeedback). Anti‐anxiety drugs were used as standard treatment. The duration of trials ranged from 3 months (12 weeks) to 18 weeks. In one study transcendental meditation showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms and electromyography score comparable with electromyography‐biofeedback and relaxation therapy. Another study compared Kundalini Yoga (KY), with Relaxation/Mindfulness Meditation. The Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale showed no statistically significant difference between groups. The overall dropout rate in both studies was high (33‐44%). Neither study reported on adverse effects of meditation. Authors' conclusions The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive‐compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed. Plain language summary Meditation therapy for anxiety disorders Although meditation therapy is widely used in many anxiety‐related conditions there is still a lack of studies in anxiety disorder patients. The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive‐compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive behavioural therapy for people with schizophrenia is a psychotherapeutic approach that establishes links between thoughts, emotions and behaviours and challenges dysfunctional thoughts. There is some evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis (CBTp) might be an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia. There are however, limitations in its provision due to available resource and training issues. One way to tackle this issue might be to offer a brief version of CBTp. Objectives To review the effects of brief CBTp (6 to 10 regular sessions given in less than 4 months and using a manual) for people with schizophrenia compared with standard CBTp (12 to 20 regular sessions given in 4 to 6 months and using a manual). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (August 21, 2013 and August 26, 2015) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We inspected all references of the selected articles for further relevant trials. We also contacted experts in the field regarding brief CBTp studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials involving adults with schizophrenia or related disorders, comparing brief cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis versus standard CBTp. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre‐specified inclusion criteria. Main results We found only seven studies which used a brief version of CBTp, but no study compared brief CBTp with CBTp of standard duration. No studies could be included. Authors' conclusions Currently there is no literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether brief CBTp is as effective, less effective or even more effective than standard courses of the same therapy. This lack of evidence for brief CBTp has serious implications for research and practice. Well planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated. Plain language summary Brief versus standard cognitive behavioural therapy for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). Characteristics of the illness are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions. People with schizophrenia may also find it difficult to find employment, make friends and socialise with other people. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works by focusing on people’s thoughts, emotions and behaviours and by challenging strange or dysfunctional thoughts. CBT was originally developed to help people with psychological disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. More recently it has been used to help people with psychosis (CBTp). Working with a therapist, people establish links between their thoughts, feelings or actions. They are encouraged to re‐evaluate their beliefs, perceptions and reasoning as well as to monitor their own thoughts, feelings, behaviours and symptoms. CBTp is suggested to provide alternative ways of coping with strange thoughts and the symptoms of schizophrenia, which should reduce distress and improve people’s functioning. Standard CBTp tends to involve around 16 sessions (12 to 20 sessions) over 4 to 6 months, while brief CBTp involves around 6 to 10 sessions, in less than 4 months. The aim of this review was to compare two types of CBTp, brief CBTp and standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. A search was run for relevant randomised studies in 2013. Only seven potentially‐relevant studies were found. However, although all of them randomised people with schizophrenia, none of these studies compared brief CBTp with standard CBTp. In the main they compared brief CBTp with standard care or other therapies. There is, therefore, no information or literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for schizophrenia and psychosis. There is a need for large scale research and trials that compare brief CBTp with standard CBTp. This research needs to evaluate costs, have clear definitions of standard and brief CBTp and focus on the time period or number of sessions, i.e. the ‘effective dose’ of CBTp.

AB: Abstract - Background Penfluridol, available since 1970, is an unusual long acting oral antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. It may be considered a depot medication as it is administered once a week. Objectives To review the effects of penfluridol for treatment of those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses in comparison to placebo, other antipsychotic medication or no intervention. Search methods We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2003‐5) and LILACS (1982‐2005). We hand searched references of all identified studies and sought citations of these studies in the Science Citation Index. We contacted the authors of trials and the manufacturer of penfluridol. We updated this search September 2012 and added eight new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria We reliably selected all randomised clinical trials comparing penfluridol to placebo or typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia or serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted and analysed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data using a random effects model, and where possible calculated the number needed to treat. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data. Main results We included twenty‐five studies with a total of 1024 participants. Most of these studies were undertaken in the 1970s when penfluridol was launched. Ten studies, with 365 patients, compared penfluridol to placebo. In the meta‐analysis of medium‐term lasting studies, penfluridol was superior to placebo in the main efficacy measures: 'improvement in global state' (n=159, 4 RCTs, RR 0.69 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 10) and 'needing additional antipsychotic' (n=138, 5 RCTs, RR 0.43 CI 0.2 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 1.8 to 20). A total of 449 patients from eleven studies were randomised to penfluridol or oral typical antipsychotics. There were no particular differences between penfluridol versus chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, thioridazine, or thiothixene for the main outcome measures in medium‐term trials: 'improvement on global state' (N=2 studies), 'leaving the study early' (N=6), 'needing additional antipsychotic' (N=3), needing antiparkinsonian medication (N=2), and side‐effects. Six studies, with 274 patients, compared penfluridol to depot typical antipsychotics. In general, for the efficacy and safety measures, no differences were established, but penfluridol was superior in keeping the patients in treatment; 'leaving the study early' (n=218, 5RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.3 to 0.97, NNT 6 CI 3.4 to 50). Authors' conclusions Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. The efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. Furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. One of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. It is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. An additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low‐cost intervention. Note: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Penfluridol for schizophrenia Synopsis pending.

AB: Abstract - Background Following traumatic brain injury (TBI) there is an increased prevalence of depression compared to the general population. It is unknown whether non‐pharmacological interventions for depression are effective for people with TBI. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions for depression in adults and children with TBI at reducing the diagnosis and severity of symptoms of depression. Search methods We ran the most recent search on 11 February 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases and clinical trials registers. Relevant conference proceedings and journals were handsearched, as were the reference lists of identified studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non‐pharmacological interventions for depression in adults and children who had a TBI. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials from the search results, then assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. The authors contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We rated the overall quality of the evidence of the primary outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results Six studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 334 adult participants. We identified no studies that included children as participants. All studies were affected by high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding of participants and personnel; five studies were affected by high risk of bias for lack of blinding of outcome assessors. There was high or unclear risk of biases affecting some studies across all the Cochrane risk of bias measures. Three studies compared a psychological intervention (either cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy) with a control intervention. Data regarding depression symptom outcome measures were combined in a meta‐analysis, but did not find an effect in favour of treatment (SMD ‐0.14; 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.19; Z = 0.83; P = 0.41). The other comparisons comprised of single studies of depression symptoms and compared; cognitive behaviour therapy versus supportive psychotherapy (SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI ‐0.65 to 0.48; Z = 0.30; P = 0.77); repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation plus tricyclic antidepressant (rTMS + TCA) versus tricyclic antidepressant alone (SMD ‐0.84; 95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.32; Z = 3;19, P = 0.001); and a supervised exercise program versus exercise as usual (SMD ‐0.43; 95% CI ‐0.88 to 0.03; Z = 1.84; P = 0.07). There was very‐low quality evidence, small effect sizes and wide variability of results, suggesting that no comparisons showed a reliable effect for any intervention. Only one study mentioned minor, transient adverse events from repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Authors' conclusions The review did not find compelling evidence in favour of any intervention. Future studies should focus on participants with a diagnosed TBI and include only participants who have a diagnosis of depression, or who record scores above a clinical cutoff on a depression measure. There is a need for additional RCTs that include a comparison between an intervention and a control that replicates the effect of the attention given to participants during an active treatment. Plain language summary Non‐drug treatments for depression in children and adults who have had a traumatic brain injury Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of non‐drug treatments for depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI), to determine whether these treatments are better than no intervention, or better than drug‐based treatments, at reducing the symptoms or diagnosis of depression. We searched for evidence about the relative effectiveness of different types of treatments, and whether the treatments had any harmful or negative effects. Background Depression is more common in people who have had a TBI. Depression increases the risk of suicide and is a factor that limits recovery from TBI. There are many non‐drug treatments for depression. This review aimed to determine the effects of non‐drug interventions for people with TBI. Search date The review authors searched for randomised studies that had been published up to February 2015. Study characteristics We found six studies, with a total of 334 adult participants. We found no studies that included people younger than 18 years of age. Four studies investigated psychological interventions. One study investigated an exercise intervention, and another investigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Key results Three studies compared a psychological therapy (cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy) with a no‐treatment control intervention. When the data for these studies were combined, there was no reliable effect in support of psychological therapy. One study compared cognitive behavioural therapy with another psychological intervention (supportive psychotherapy), and did not find an effect in favour of either intervention. One study compared a supervised exercise programme with exercise as usual, but did not find a effect in favour of either intervention. One study compared rTMS plus an antidepressant medication with the antidepressant medication alone. Because the quality of the evidence was very low, it was not possible to draw the conclusion that the addition of rTMS improved outcomes. Only one study, of rTMS, reported any harmful effects and these were relatively minor and resolved quickly. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was rated very low. All studies were at high risk of bias in some ways, and therefore it was not possible to draw conclusions in support of any intervention. There was a high degree of variability in the main results, which meant we could have little confidence in the findings. Some studies had major methodological flaws. Conclusions It is not possible to recommend any particular treatment based on the current evidence. The review authors have made some recommendations to improve the quality of the evidence in future studies.

AB: Abstract - Background Zhiling decoction has a fixed composition of 15 Chinese herbs. The properties of each of these herbs and in combination provide the therapeutic rationale for a possible action of Zhiling decoction in dilating cerebral vessels and increasing cerebral blood flow, as well as reducing serum cholesterol. Thus the aim of this review is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Zhiling decoction for the treatment of vascular dementia. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of Zhiling decoction for vascular dementia. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 17 March 2008 using the term: zhiling. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing Zhiling decoction with placebo in people with vascular dementia. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials where possible. Main results In the absence of any suitable randomised placebo‐controlled trials in this area, we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions The currently available evidence is insufficient to assess the potential for Zhiling decoction in the treatment of vascular dementia. The little objective data concerning the management of Zhiling decoction versus Naofukang suggests that Zhiling decoction may be effective in treating vascular dementia.     There is no evidence for or against Zhiling as a treatment for vascular dementia. Further randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials are urgently needed in order to define the relative efficacy and acceptability of Zhiling in vascular dementia. Plain language summary No evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against the use of Zhiling concoction in the treatment of people with vascular dementia Zhiling is a decoction of 15 Chinese herbs which is thought to contribute to dilating cerebral vessels and increasing cerebral blood flow, as well as reducing serum cholesterol. No randomised controlled trials of Zhiling decoction versus placebo were found and thus its efficacy and safety could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for randomised placebo controlled trials of Zhiling decoction.

AB: Abstract - Background Childhood and adolescent mental health problems are a serious and growing concern worldwide. Research suggests that psychotherapy can have a significant and positive impact on children and adolescents with mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders, depression and conduct disorders. Client feedback tools serve as a method of monitoring clients' progress and providing feedback from clients to therapists during the therapeutic process. These tools may help to enhance clinicians' decision‐making by allowing them to adapt their treatment plans as the therapy progresses, resulting in a reduction of treatment failures. Research has shown that client feedback tools have a positive effect on adults' psychotherapy. This review addresses whether feedback tools in child and adolescent therapy could help therapists to better treat their young clients. Objectives To assess the effects of client feedback in psychological therapy on child and adolescent mental health outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR, Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (1946‐), Embase (1974‐) and PsycINFO (1967‐) to 3 April 2018. We did not apply any restriction on date, language or publication status to the search. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared client feedback to no client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed references for inclusion eligibility and extracted outcome, risk of bias and study characteristics data into customised forms. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and calculated their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs), or standardised mean differences (SMDs) if different scales were used to measure the same outcome. We used a random‐effects model for all analyses. Main results We included six published RCTs, conducted in the USA (5 RCTs) and Israel (1 RCT), with 1097 children and adolescents (11 to 18 years old), in the review. We are very uncertain about the effect of client feedback on improvement of symptoms, as reported by youth in the short term because we considered evidence to be of very low‐certainty due to high risk of bias and very serious inconsistency in the effect estimates from the different studies. Similarly, we are very uncertain about the effect of client feedback on treatment acceptability, due to high risk of bias, imprecision in the results, and indirectness of measuring the outcome (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.61; 2 studies, 237 participants; very low‐certainty). Overall, most studies reported and carried out randomisation and allocation concealment adequately. None of the studies were blinded or attempted to blind participants and personnel and were at high risk of performance bias, and only one study had blind outcome assessors. All of the studies were at high or unclear risk of attrition bias mainly due to poor, non‐transparent reporting of participants' flow through the studies. Authors' conclusions Due to the paucity of high‐quality data and considerable inconsistency in results from different studies, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach any firm conclusions regarding the role of client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents with mental health problems, and further research on this important topic is needed. Future studies should avoid risks of performance, detection and attrition biases, as seen in the studies included in this review. Studies from countries other than the USA are needed, as well as studies including children younger than 10 years. Plain language summary Client feedback in psychological therapy for children and adolescents with mental health problems Why is this review important? Systematic feedback from clients to psychotherapists may improve outcomes of psychological therapy. Typically, client feedback is provided regularly throughout the course of therapy. Clients fill in a questionnaire about how they feel about the therapy and how they are feeling in general. The questionnaire is then scored and reviewed by the therapist. The idea is that the therapist will use the feedback to adjust the therapy process, aiming to improve the client‐therapist and client‐therapy fit and, ultimately, client involvement, treatment response and outcomes. There is empirical evidence for the use of client feedback in adult psychotherapy to improve outcomes and response, but there is limited knowledge about this practice in children and adolescents. This review can provide a better understanding of the current role of client feedback in psychotherapy for children and adolescents, as well as future directions that promote evidence‐based practice in child and adolescent psychotherapy. Who will be interested in this review? Psychotherapists working with children and adolescents, policy makers, children and adolescents with mental health problems, and their caregivers and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? Some research suggests that client feedback has a positive impact on outcomes of psychotherapy with adults. We do not know whether client feedback works with children and adolescents. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials, where children and adolescents with mental health problems were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive either psychotherapy with client feedback or standard psychotherapy. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 3 April 2018, and found six (with a total of 1097 children and adolescents) that met our inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have been few investigations of client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents with mental health problems. Most of them were carried out in the USA with older children and adolescents (11 to 18 years old). There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of client feedback in psychological therapy for children and adolescents. What should happen next? It cannot be ruled out that client feedback has positive effects on psychotherapy outcomes in children and adolescents. High‐quality studies are needed to provide sufficient evidence. Future studies should also include younger children, and should take place in countries other than the USA.

AB: Abstract - Background Vascular dementia represents the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. In older patients, in particular, the combination of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease is common, and is referred to as mixed dementia. The classification of vascular dementia broadly follows three clinico‐pathological processes: multi‐infarct dementia, single strategic infarct dementia and subcortical dementia. Not all victims fulfil strict criteria for dementia and may be significantly cognitively impaired without memory loss, when the term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is more useful. Currently, no established standard treatment for VCI exists. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are common to both Alzheimer's disease and VCI, raising the possibility that cholinesterase inhibitors ‐ such as rivastigmine ‐ which are beneficial in Alzheimer's disease, may also be beneficial for VCI. Objectives To assess the efficacy of rivastigmine compared with placebo in the treatment of people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register) on 12 February 2013 using the terms: rivastigmine, exelon, "SDZ ENA 713". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All unconfounded randomized double‐blind trials comparing rivastigmine with placebo in the treatment of people with VCI, vascular dementia or mixed dementia were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted and assessed data independently, and agreement was reached after discussion. They noted results concerning adverse effects. Main results Three trials, with a total of 800 participants, were identified for inclusion. The participants in one trial did not have dementia, while the other two studies included participants with dementia of different severities. The dose of rivastigmine was different in each study. No pooling of study results was attempted because of these differences between the studies. One trial included 40 participants with subcortical vascular dementia (age range 40 to 90 years) with a mean mini‐mental state examination (MMSE) score of 13.0 and 13.4 in the rivastigmine and placebo arms, respectively. Treatment over 26 weeks was limited to 3 mg rivastigmine twice daily, or placebo. No significant difference was found on any outcome measure relevant to cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, function or global rating, or in the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment. Another trial included 710 participants with vascular dementia, including subcortical and cortical forms (age range 50 to 85 years). Over 24 weeks, a mean dose of rivastigmine of 9.4 mg/day was achieved versus placebo. Baseline MMSE was identical for both groups, at 19.1. Statistically significant advantage in cognitive response (but not with global impression of change or non‐cognitive measures) was seen with rivastigmine treatment at 24 weeks (MMSE change from baseline MD 0.6, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.09, P value 0.02; Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale (VaDAS) change from baseline MD ‐1.3, 95% CI‐2.62 to 0.02, P value 0.05 ). Significantly higher rates of vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea and anorexia and withdrawals from treatment were noted in the participants randomized to rivastigmine compared with placebo (withdrawals rivastigmine 90/365, placebo 48/345, OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.98) (withdrawals due to an adverse event rivastigmine 49/365, placebo 19/345, OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.62, P value 0.0005). The third study included 50 participants (age range 48 to 84 years) with mean MMSE scores of 23.7 and 23.9 in the rivastigmine and placebo arms, respectively. Over a 24‐week period, participants labelled as having cognitive impairment but no dementia (CIND) following ischaemic stroke were given up to 4.5 mg rivastigmine twice daily, or placebo. Primary and secondary outcome measures showed no statistically significant difference when considering neurocognitive abilities, function, neuropsychiatric symptoms and global performance. One participant in the rivastigmine group and two in the placebo group discontinued their medication because of an adverse effect. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence of benefit of rivastigmine in VCI from trial data from three studies. However, this conclusion is based on one large study. Rivastigmine is capable of inducing side effects that lead to withdrawal in a significant proportion of patients. Plain language summary Rivastigmine for vascular cognitive impairment Vascular dementia (i.e. dementia caused by disease of blood vessels affecting the supply of blood to the brain) is one of the most common types of dementia. It includes dementia caused by stroke. It may exist by itself or with other common dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Sometimes vascular disease can present with cognitive problems which are less severe than dementia. Those with vascular dementia may have significant cognitive impairment without major memory loss. The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is useful, because of the range of different ways in which people are affected. Rivastigmine is a drug widely used in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It works by preventing breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter (signalling molecule). Levels of acetylcholine are reduced in VCI as well as in AD and so it may also help people with VCI. Researchers searched for all trials that compared rivastigmine with placebo in people with VCI, and identified three. Only one of these showed any significant results, and it did show some benefit for people with VCI who took rivastigmine. However, nausea and vomiting were a frequent side effect of taking the drug. Therefore it remains uncertain how useful rivastigmine is for people with VCI .

AB: Abstract - Background Products of the maidenhair tree, Ginkgo biloba, have long been used in China as a traditional medicine for various disorders of health. A standardized extract is widely used in the West for the treatment of a range of conditions including memory and concentration problems, confusion, depression, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus and headache. The mechanisms of action are thought to reflect the action of several components of the extract and include increasing blood supply by dilating blood vessels, reducing blood viscosity, modification of neurotransmitter systems, and reducing the density of oxygen free radicals. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo biloba for dementia or cognitive decline. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 20 September 2007 using the terms: ginkgo*, tanakan, EGB‐761, EGB761, "EGB 761" and gingko*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria Randomized, double‐blind studies, in which extracts of Ginkgo biloba at any strength and over any period were compared with placebo for their effects on people with acquired cognitive impairment, including dementia, of any degree of severity. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the published reports of the included studies, pooled where appropriate and the treatment effects or the risks and benefits estimated. Main results 36 trials were included but most were small and of duration less than three months. Nine trials were of six months duration (2016 patients). These longer trials were the more recent trials and generally were of adequate size, and conducted to a reasonable standard. Most trials tested the same standardised preparation of Ginkgo biloba, EGb 761, at different doses, which are classified as high or low. The results from the more recent trials showed inconsistent results for cognition, activities of daily living, mood, depression and carer burden. Of the four most recent trials to report results three found no difference between Ginkgo biloba and placebo, and one reported very large treatment effects in favour of Ginkgo biloba. There are no significant differences between Ginkgo biloba and placebo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events. A subgroup analysis including only patients diagnosed with Alzhiemer's disease (925 patients from nine trials) also showed no consistent pattern of any benefit associated with Ginkgo biloba. Authors' conclusions Ginkgo biloba appears to be safe in use with no excess side effects compared with placebo. Many of the early trials used unsatisfactory methods, were small, and publication bias cannot be excluded. The evidence that Ginkgo biloba has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unreliable. Plain language summary There is no convincing evidence that Ginkgo biloba is efficacious for dementia and cognitive impairment Ginkgo biloba appears to be safe in use with no excess adverse effects compared with placebo. Many of the early trials used unsatisfactory methods, were small, and publication bias cannot be excluded. Overall, evidence that Ginkgo has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unreliable. Of the four most recent trials to report results, three found no difference between Ginkgo biloba and placebo, and one reported very large treatment effects in favour of Ginkgo biloba.

AB: Abstract - Background Eating disorders represent an extremely difficult, time‐consuming and costly condition to treat. Being young, female, and dieting are some of the few identified risk factors that have been reliably linked to the development of eating disorders. There is currently limited evidence in the published literature to suggest that any particular type of program is effective in preventing eating disorders and there has been concern that some interventions have the potential to cause harm. Objectives To determine if eating disorder prevention programs for children and adolescents are effective in: (1) promoting healthy eating attitudes and behaviours; (2) promoting protective psychological factors; (3) promoting satisfactory physical health; (4) having a long‐term, sustainable, and positive impact on mental and physical health; and, (5) ensuring safety in relation to possible harmful consequences on mental or physical health. Search methods Relevant trials are identified through searching the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CCTR) and relevant biomedical and social science databases, as well as reference lists from articles identified through the search strategy and contact with experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a major focus on eating disorder prevention programs for children and adolescents, where there is no known DSM‐IV diagnosis of an eating disorder, are eligible for inclusion in the review. Trials must include a control group and at least one objective outcome measure (e.g., BMI) or a standardised psychological measure used with the intervention and control group, pre‐ and post‐intervention. Data collection and analysis A total of 1016 titles have been identified through the search to date. Twenty‐two studies were located that reported use of a randomised controlled trial methodology and were critically appraised by two independent reviewers. Twelve studies met the selection criteria outlined above. Main results Combined data from two eating disorder prevention programs based on a media literacy and advocacy approach indicate a reduction in the internalisation or acceptance of societal ideals relating to appearance at a 3‐ to 6‐month follow‐up (Kusel 1999; Neumark* 2000) [SMD ‐0.28, ‐0.51 to ‐0.05, 95% CI]. There is insufficient evidence to support the effect of five programs designed to address eating attitudes and behaviours and other adolescent issues in the general community or those classified as being at high risk for eating disorder (Buddeberg* 1998; Dalle Grave 2001; Killen 1993; Santonastaso 1999; Zanetti 1999) and insufficient evidence to support the effect of two programs designed to improve self‐esteem (O'Dea 2000; Wade 2003). Data from two didactic eating disorder awareness programs could not be pooled for analysis. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that harm resulted from any of the prevention programs included in the review. Authors' conclusions The one significant pooled effect in the current review does not allow for any firm conclusions to be made about the impact of prevention programs for eating disorders in children and adolescents, although none of the pooled comparisons indicated evidence of harm. The meta‐analysis is in the process of being revised to account for the impact of cluster randomised trials. Plain language summary Preventing eating disorders in children and adolescents Eating disorders represent an extremely difficult, time‐consuming and costly condition to treat. Being young, female, and dieting are some of the few identified risk factors that have been reliably linked to the development of eating disorders. Several eating disorder prevention programs have been developed and trialled with children and adolescents. There is currently limited evidence in the published literature to suggest that any particular type of program is effective in preventing eating disorders and there has been concern that some interventions have the potential to cause harm. The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether these interventions are effective in the prevention of eating disorders in children and adolescents. Only one statistically significant result was found in the present meta‐analysis ‐ a slight effect of media literacy and advocacy programs in reducing acceptance of societal body image ideals. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that harm was caused by any of the 12 randomised controlled trials included in the review at short‐term follow‐up. The meta‐analysis is in the process of being revised to account for the impact of cluster randomised trials.

AB: Abstract - Background Most people with schizophrenia have a cyclical pattern of illness characterised by remission and relapses. The illness can reduce the ability of self‐care and functioning and can lead to the illness becoming disabling. Life skills programmes, emphasising the needs associated with independent functioning, are often a part of the rehabilitation process. These programmes have been developed to enhance independent living and quality of life for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of life skills programmes compared with standard care or other comparable therapies for people with chronic mental health problems. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010). We supplemented this process with handsearching and scrutiny of references. We inspected references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials for life skills programmes versus other comparable therapies or standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 483 participants. These evaluated life skills programmes versus standard care, or support group. We found no significant difference in life skills performance between people given life skills training and standard care (1 RCT, n = 32, MD ‐1.10; 95% CI ‐7.82 to 5.62). Life skills training did not improve or worsen study retention (5 RCTs, n = 345, RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.40 to 3.36). We found no significant difference in PANSS positive, negative or total scores between life skills intervention and standard care. We found quality of life scores to be equivocal between participants given life skills training (1 RCT, n = 32, MD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.03) and standard care. Life skills compared with support groups also did not reveal any significant differences in PANSS scores, quality of life, or social performance skills (1 RCT, n = 158, MD ‐0.90; 95% CI ‐3.39 to 1.59). Authors' conclusions Currently there is no good evidence to suggest life skills programmes are effective for people with chronic mental illnesses. More robust data are needed from studies that are adequately powered to determine whether life skills training is beneficial for people with chronic mental health problems. Plain language summary Life skills programmes for chronic mental illnesses Having a mental health problem can cause difficulties and obstacles in all areas of life, even those as simple as washing, shopping, talking openly with other people, brushing teeth, cleaning the house, managing money, making friends, shaving and being independent. Having a mental health problem, combined with the sleep‐like haze of many antipsychotic medications, limits people’s ability to look after themselves, socialise with other people, take part in education or career development and find work.  Life skills programmes attempt to remedy some of these difficulties by encouraging independent living, so enhancing quality of life. Life skills often have several components: communication and talking; financial awareness and money management; domestic tasks (such as cooking, washing‐ up dishes, hoovering, doing the laundry and running a home); and personal self‐care (such as washing, bathing, cleaning teeth, shaving, combing hair and getting dressed). Other life skills include training on coping with stress, shopping for and eating healthy food, knowing the time, taking medication, improving social skills, using transport and forward planning.   Rehabilitation or getting better is slow, complex and difficult. There are many ways of engaging with people during this process, including: creative therapies (art, drama, music, poetry, education, dancing, singing); life skills (as described above); work‐based therapy to enhance employment; and recreational activities (such as group walks, swimming, sport, reading, writing a diary, watching television, going to parties, events and day trips).  This review looks at different types of rehabilitation therapy for people with mental health problems. It compares life skills training with occupational therapy and peer support (where a group of people with mental health problems were encouraged to help each other). Comparison was also made with standard or usual care. Life skills, occupational therapy and peer support all aim to promote health by enabling people to perform meaningful and purposeful activities. In the main, the authors of the review conclude that there is no great difference between those that receive life skills, occupational therapy, peer support and standard care. It is questionable if people should be put under pressure to attend life skills and not known whether life skills are a benefit or perhaps even harmful. Professionals and service users invest much time in life skills and this may cost both time and money. However, the quality of scientific evidence is low and uncertain. The authors note that life skills are still a simple and easy way that has the potential to make great benefits for people who are almost disabled by mental health problems.

AB: Abstract - Background Nidotherapy is a therapeutic method that principally aims to modify the environment of people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses, whilst working in conjunction with, or alongside other treatments. Rather than focusing on direct treatments or interventions, the aim is to help the individual identify the need for, and work to effect environmental change with the aim of minimising the impact of any form of mental disorder on the individual and society. Objectives To review the effects of nidotherapy added to standard care, compared with standard care or no treatment for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2011) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching nidotherapy articles and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared nidotherapy with standard care or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We independently selected and quality assessed potential trials. We reliably extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data. Scale data were only extracted from valid scales. For non‐skewed continuous endpoint data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. Skewed data have been presented in the Data and analyses as 'other data', with acknowledged means and standard deviations. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included only one study that compared nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care with standard care alone (total 52 participants); this study was classified by its authors as a 'pilot study'. The duration of the included study was 18 months in total. The single study examined the short‐term (up to six months) and medium‐term (between six and 12 months) effects of nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care versus standard care. Nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care was favoured over standard care for social functioning in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐4.66 to 0.46) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD ‐1.70, 95% CI ‐4.60 to 1.20,  Very low quality ); however, these results did not reach statistical significance. Results concerning engagement with non‐inpatient services favoured the intervention group in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.87) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD 1.70, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 3.49), with statistical significance evident in the short term, but not in the medium term. Results of people leaving the study early favoured the intervention in the short term (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.98), with slight favour of the control group at medium term (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.54); again, these results did not reach statistical significance. Results for the adverse effects/events of death (measured by 12 months) favoured the intervention (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.74,  Very low quality ) but with no statistical significance. Skewed results were available for mental state, service use, and economic outcomes, and present a mixed picture of the benefits of nidotherapy. Authors' conclusions Further research is needed into the possible benefits or harms of this newly‐formulated therapy. Until such research is available, patients, clinicians, managers and policymakers should consider it an experimental approach. Plain language summary Nidotherapy for schizophrenia Nidotherapy (from the Latin ‘ nidus ’ or ‘nest’) aims at identifying the need for and making changes to a person’s environment and surroundings. It works alongside other treatments to make improvements to a person’s well being, housing, money management, personal relationships, work and other factors. The aim of nidotherapy is not to change the person (whereas other psychological therapies often aim to make changes in an individual’s behaviour, emotions and thinking) but to create a better ‘fit’ between the environment and the individual. As a consequence the individual may improve, but this is not a direct result of treatment but because a more harmonious relationship has been created with the environment. Benefits of nidotherapy may include improvements in people’s relationships, self‐esteem, taking their medication, mental health and generally creating a better life situation. If environmental factors or someone’s surroundings are at all responsible for causing illness and relapse, then nidotherapists and people with schizophrenia can identify these factors together to try and reduce the number and severity of relapses. This review includes one small pilot study with 52 participants. The study compared nidotherapy with standard care versus standard care alone and lasted 18 months. Findings suggest some limited evidence that those who received nidotherapy might experience a slight improvement in social functioning or personal relationships, mental state and may spend less time as inpatients in hospital over the course of 12 months, but there is no information concerning the appropriateness of this for the individual. However, these limited findings need to be treated with considerable caution. The degree of any possible improvements that come from taking part in nidotherapy remain unclear due to the single study’s small sample size, incomplete evidence and risk of bias. No evidence is available on the effect of nidotherapy on general functioning, quality of life, taking medication, satisfaction with treatment, employment status or adverse effects. Further research is required to fill this gap in knowledge about the effectiveness, benefits and possible hazards of nidotherapy. Until such a time, people with mental health problems, health professionals, managers and policymakers should consider this new therapy an experimental one.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic medication remains the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and has been in use for a long time. As evidenced by ongoing research and partial effectiveness of the antipsychotics on cognitive and negative symptoms, the search is on for drugs that may improve these domains of functioning for someone suffering from schizophrenia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have long been in use for treating cognitive symptoms of dementia. Objectives The aim of the review was to evaluate the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for treating people with schizophrenia Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2009), and inspected the references of all identified studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all clinical randomised trials comparing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with antipsychotics or placebo either alone, or in combination, for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor plus antipsychotic showed benefit over antipsychotic and placebo in the following outcomes. 1. Mental state ‐ PANSS negative symptoms average end point score (2 RCTs, n = 31, MD ‐1.69 95% CI ‐2.80 to ‐0.57), PANSS General Psychopathology average end point score (2 RCTs, n = 31, MD ‐3.86 95% CI ‐5.40 to ‐2.32), and improvement in depressive symptoms showed at least by one short‐term study as measured by CDSS scale (data skewed). 2. Cognitive domains ‐ attention, (1 RCT, n = 73, MD 1.20 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26), visual memory (2 RCTs, n = 48 , MD 1.90 95% CI 0.52 to 3.28), verbal memory and language (3 RCTs, n = 42, MD 3.46 95% CI 0.67 to 6.26) and executive functioning (1 RCT, n = 24, MD 17.10 95% CI 0.70 to 33.50). 3. Tolerability ‐ EPSE: AIMS, (1 RCT, n = 35, MD 1.50 95% CI 1.04 to 1.96). No difference was noted between the two arms in other outcomes. The overall rate of participants leaving studies early was low (13.6 %) and showed no clear difference between the two groups. Authors' conclusions The results seem to favour the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in combination with antipsychotics on a few domains of mental state and cognition, but because of the various limitations in the studies as mentioned in the main text, the evidence is weak. This review highlights the need for large, independent, well designed, conducted and reported pragmatic randomised studies. Plain language summary Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors versus antipsychotics for schizophrenia either alone or in combination with antipsychotics. This review compares the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors alone, or in combination with antipsychotics, compared with antipsychotics alone, or placebo plus antipsychotics. Adding acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with antipsychotics may improve the general psychopathology/negative symptomatology/depressive symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Also, the combination may be useful in improving the attention/reaction time and memory areas of cognition. The major limitation of the results was that most of the studies found were short‐term studies. Considering the chronic, severe and enduring nature of schizophrenia, one cannot get a true picture unless well designed long‐term studies are done. We hope that this review will highlight the need for more studies in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Postpartum depression is a major health issue for many women from diverse cultures. While pharmacological interventions are an effective treatment for depression, mothers are often reluctant to take antidepressant medication due to concerns about breast milk transmission or potential side‐effects. It is important that non‐pharmacologic interventions be evaluated for use with postpartum women experiencing depressive symptomatology. Objectives Primary: to assess the effects of all psychosocial and psychological interventions compared with usual postpartum care in the reduction of depressive symptomatology.   Secondary: to examine (1) the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial interventions; (2) the effectiveness of specific types of psychological interventions; (3) the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial interventions versus psychological interventions; (4) the effects of intervention mode (e.g., individual versus group‐based interventions); and (5) the effects of sample selection criteria (e.g., targeting women with clinically diagnosed depression versus self‐reported depressive symptomatology). Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 1/8/2007, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006) and CINAHL (1982 to 2006) using various combinations of the terms 'postpartum/postnatal depression.' Secondary references and experts in the field were used to identify other published or unpublished trials. Selection criteria All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials of psychosocial or psychological interventions where the primary or secondary aim was a reduction in depressive symptomatology. Data collection and analysis Both review authors participated in the evaluation of methodological quality and data extraction. Additional information was sought from several trial researchers. Results are presented using relative risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for continuous data. Main results Ten trials met the inclusion criteria, of which nine trials reported outcomes for 956 women. Any psychosocial or psychological intervention, compared to usual postpartum care, was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of continued depression, however measured, at the final assessment within the first year postpartum. Both psychosocial and psychological interventions were effective in reducing depressive symptomatology. Trials selecting participants based on a clinical diagnosis of depression were just as effective in decreasing depressive symptomatology as those that enrolled women who met inclusion criteria based on self‐reported depressive symptomatology. Authors' conclusions Although the methodological quality of the majority of trials was, in general, not strong, the meta‐analysis results suggest that psychosocial and psychological interventions are an effective treatment option for women suffering from postpartum depression. The long‐term effectiveness remains unclear. Plain language summary Psychosocial and psychological interventions for postpartum depression Postpartum depression affects approximately 13% of all new mothers. Many women desire to try treatment options other than medication. Results from nine trials involving 956 women found that both psychosocial (e.g., peer support, non‐directive counselling) and psychological (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy) interventions appear to be effective in reducing symptoms of postpartum depression. The long‐term benefits are unknown. Larger trials evaluating psychosocial and psychological treatments for postpartum depression are needed to provide clear conclusions about specific intervention benefits.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000359
AB: Abstract - Background Currently hydergine is used almost exclusively for treating patients with either dementia, or 'age‐related' cognitive symptoms. Since the early 1980s there have been over a dozen more clinical trials, yet hydergine's efficacy remains uncertain. Although previous reviews offer generally favourable support for hydergine's efficacy, they were, however, limited by a bias with respect to the particular clinical studies chosen (e.g., the inclusion of case reports, and uncontrolled trials), and by authors' impressionistic assessments of results. Not surprisingly, there has been a lack of consensus among reviewers with regard to the efficacy of hydergine. In 1994, a meta‐analysis was published by the present reviewers who reported that overall, hydergine was more effective than placebo. However they also observed that the statistical evidence for efficacy in 'possible or probable Alzheimer's disease' patients was so modest that one additional statistically non‐significant trial would have reduced the results to non‐significance. Objectives Because of uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of hydergine, the goals of this overview were to assess its overall effect in patients with possible dementia, and to investigate potential moderators of an effect. Search methods The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 2 March 2009 using the terms hydergin*, ergoloid* and dihydroergo*. Two proprietary databases were also searched. Published reviews were inspected for further sources. Selection criteria Trials to be included must be randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, and unconfounded comparisons of hydergine with placebo for a treatment duration of greater than one week in subjects with dementia or symptoms consistent with dementia. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by the reviewers, pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled odds ratios (95% CI) or the average differences (95% CI) were estimated. Where possible, intention‐to‐treat data were used. Outcomes of interest included clinical global impressions of change and comprehensive rating scales. Potential moderating variables of a treatment effect included: inpatient/outpatient status, trial duration, age, sex, medication dose, publication year, and diagnostic grouping. Main results There were a total of 19 trials that met inclusion criteria and that had data sufficient for analysis. Thirteen trials reported sufficient information to use a global rating of improvement and nine trials provided information on a comprehensive rating scale. Three trials provided both outcome measures. It was not possible to use many of the published results in a combined analysis owing to the lack of sufficient data to perform statistical analyses. For the 12 trials that used global ratings, there was a significant effect favouring hydergine (OR 3.78, 95% CI, 2.72 to 5.27). For the nine trials that used comprehensive ratings, there was a significant mean difference favouring hydergine (WMD 0.96, 95%CI, 0.54 to 1.37). Hydergine was well tolerated in these trials, with 78% of randomized subjects available for data analyses. Greater effect sizes on global ratings were associated with younger age, and possibly higher dose, although most of the subgroup analyses were statistically insignificant. Authors' conclusions As in an earlier systematic review, we found hydergine to show significant treatment effects when assessed by either global ratings or comprehensive rating scales (based here on a smaller set of trials than in the earlier published systematic review because trials were required to have data that could conform with MetaView, the Cochrane Collaboration statistics software). The small number of trials available for analysis, however, limited the ability of subgroup analyses to identify statistically significant moderating effects. Unfortunately, most of the randomized, double‐blind, and placebo‐controlled trials of hydergine were conducted and published before the advent of consensus‐based diagnostic standards of dementia in 1984; therefore diagnostic criteria were less specific. As a result, uncertainty remains regarding hydergine's efficacy in dementia. Plain language summary Uncertainty about the efficacy of hydergine in dementia Hydergine has been used to treat patients with either dementia, or 'age‐related' cognitive symptoms. Hydergine may offer benefit to some patients, possibly at doses of 4.5 to 9.0 mg per day, with possibly greater benefit to younger subjects and inpatients. The statistical evidence for efficacy in 'possible or probable Alzheimer's disease' patients was so modest however that one additional statistically non‐significant trial would have reduced the results to non significance; evidence for efficacy in vascular dementia rested on relatively stronger effects for hydergine on clinical ratings; and effective doses may be higher than 3 mg/d (i.e., than that currently approved in the USA). Despite its availability for 40 years, the circumstances of hydergine's efficacy in dementia syndromes have not been adequately researched, and have yet to be precisely defined.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009639.pub3
AB: Abstract - Background People with serious mental illness have rates of Human Immuno‐deficiency Virus (HIV) infection higher than expected in the general population for the same demographic area. Despite this elevated prevalence, UK national strategies around sexual health and HIV prevention do not state that people with serious mental illness are a high risk group. However, a significant proportion in this group are sexually active and engage in HIV‐risk behaviours including having multiple sexual partners, infrequent use of condoms and trading sex for money or drugs. Therefore we propose the provision of HIV prevention advice could enhance the physical and social well being of this population. Objectives To assess the effects of HIV prevention advice in reducing morbidity, mortality and preserving the quality of life in people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (24 January 2012; 4 July 2016). Selection criteria We planned to include all randomised controlled trials focusing on HIV prevention advice versus standard care or comparing HIV prevention advice with other more focused methods of delivering care or information for people with serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis Review authors (NW, AC, AA, GT) independently screened search results and did not identify any studies that fulfilled the review’s criteria. Main results We did not identify any randomised studies that evaluated advice regarding HIV for people with serious mental illness. The excluded studies illustrate that randomisation of packages of care relevant to both people with serious mental illness and HIV risk are possible. Authors' conclusions Policy makers, clinicians, researchers and service users need to collaborate to produce guidance on how best to provide advice for people with serious mental illness in preventing the spread of HIV infection. It is entirely feasible that this could be within the context of a well‐designed simple large randomised study. Plain language summary HIV prevention advice for people with serious mental illness The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a condition in humans in which our immune systems steadily begins to fail and allows life‐threatening infections and cancers. People with mental illness have higher than usual rates of HIV than in the general population. Despite this, UK national strategies around sexual health and HIV prevention do not state that people with serious mental illness are a high risk group. A significant number of people with mental health problems are sexually active and engage in HIV‐risk behaviours such as having multiple sexual partners, not using condoms and trading sex for money or drugs. In addition, during relapse, mental illness may lead people to engage in practices they would not usually be engaged in. The provision of HIV prevention advice could enhance the physical and social well being of people with mental health problems. HIV health advice can take many forms. Advice is the active provision of information. It has an education component and is delivered in a gentle and non‐patronising manner. Advice from a healthcare professional can have a positive impact on behaviour and may motivate people to seek further support and treatment. The review's aim was to assess the potential beneficial or harmful effects of HIV prevention advice in people with serious mental illness (SMI). A search for randomised trials comparing HIV prevention advice with standard care for people with SMI was run in January 2012 and July 2016. However, no studies or trials were found. Policy makers, health professionals, researchers and people with mental health problems need to collaborate to produce evidence‐based guidance on how best to provide advice for people with serious mental illness in preventing the spread of HIV. Better guidance and information about HIV in people with mental illness could be found by conducting well‐designed, simple and large studies on this important topic.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a common illness in older people and has major implications for individuals with the disease, their carers and society. A meta‐analysis of population based studies in Europe found the prevalence of dementia in individuals over 65 to be 6.4%. Homeopathy (also spelt "homoeopathy") is a popular form of "complementary" or "alternative" treatment. Some studies have found evidence for efficacy of homeopathic treatment for some conditions, but any mechanism of action of the ultra molecular dilutions used in homeopathy is not comprehensible in terms of current scientific concepts. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety profile of homeopathically prepared medications used in treating dementia, as established by randomized controlled trials. Search methods The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 9 March 2009 using the terms alum*, homeop*, "nat sulph" and "natrum sulphate". In addition the reviewers searched CISCOM, AMED and Hom‐Inform. Leading homeopathic researchers, practitioners and manufacturers were also contacted. Selection criteria All types of randomized controlled trials with a sample size of more than 20 were considered. Data collection and analysis The database searches resulted in one trial being identified. After examining the abstract, a paper copy was obtained and independently assessed for inclusion by RM and JW. Main results There were no studies that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion and no data to present. Authors' conclusions In view of the absence of evidence it is not possible to comment on the use of homeopathy in treating dementia. The extent of homeopathic prescribing for people with dementia is not clear and so it is difficult to comment on the importance of conducting trials in this area. Plain language summary No evidence that homeopathy is effective in treating dementia Dementia is a distressing illness that has major implications for individuals with the disease and their carers. Homeopathy is a popular type of complementary medicine. It is however controversial because although there is some evidence that it is not just a placebo, no one understands how it could work. The researchers did not find any good quality trials and so cannot say whether it is or is not effective for treating this condition. As no information is available on how much homeopathy is used for dementia, it is difficult to say whether it is important to conduct more trials.

AB: Abstract - Background Oxidative processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer's disease. Protecting the central nervous system against these damaging mechanisms may be a useful therapeutic approach. Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an endogenous antioxidant that interrupts cellular oxidative processes in both its oxidized and reduced forms. These properties might qualify ALA for a modulatory role in the treatment of people with dementia. Objectives To assess the role and clinical efficacy of alpha lipoic acid in the treatment of dementia. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 3 January 2008 using the terms 'alpha lipoic acid' and 'thioctic'. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All double‐blind randomized placebo‐controlled trials examining the efficacy of alpha lipoic acid in dementia. Data collection and analysis No trials were found that met the selection criteria Main results No meta‐analysis could be performed. A systematic search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, as well as registers of ongoing and unpublished trials, could not identify any studies investigating the use of ALA for dementia. Authors' conclusions In the absence of randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials investigating ALA for dementia, no evidence exists to explore any potential effects. Until data from trials become available for analysis, ALA cannot be recommended for people with dementia. Plain language summary No evidence of efficacy of alpha lipoic acid for dementia Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is one of a number of potent antioxidants for which a potential therapeutic role in dementia has been postulated. This suggestion arises from the possibility that oxidative and inflammatory processes contribute to the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease. Whilst ALA has been used as part of the treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, no placebo‐controlled randomized trials have been conducted for its use in degenerative dementias. ALA for the treatment of dementia of any subtype cannot currently be recommended.

Objectives To determine the effectiveness of shunting procedures in promoting stability or improvement in the neurological symptoms and signs of NPH.

Selection criteria Studies included for analysis were those involving the placement of a CSF shunt for the treatment of NPH as part of a randomized controlled trial. Data collection and analysis No data matching the selection criteria were found. Main results No randomized controlled trials of shunt placement versus no shunt were found. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence to indicate whether placement of a shunt is effective in the management of NPH. Plain language summary There is no evidence to indicate whether placement of a shunt to remove fluid is effective in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a rare but potentially treatable cause of dementia. Since the condition was first described in 1965, it has conventionally been treated by placement of a shunt to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain. No trial has yet compared the placement of a shunt versus no shunt in a randomized controlled manner. Nor have the long‐term outcomes of treated and untreated normal pressure hydrocephalus been compared. There is, therefore, no evidence for the use of shunts in the management of normal pressure hydrocephalus.

AB: Abstract - Background People with dementia often wander, at times putting themselves at risk and presenting challenges to carers and institutional staff. Traditional interventions to prevent wandering include restraint, drugs and locked doors. Cognitively impaired people may respond to environmental stimuli (sounds, images, smells) in ways distinct from healthy people. This has led to trials of visual and other selective barriers (such as mirrors, camouflage, grids/stripes of tape) that may reduce wandering. Objectives We assess the effect of subjective exit modifications on the wandering behaviour of cognitively impaired people. The second objective is to inform the direction and methods of future research. Search methods The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 9 March 2009 using the terms: exit*, wander*, camouflage, bars, stripe*, grid*, floor*, door*, barrier*, elopement, ambulat* Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled trials provide the highest quality evidence, but interrupted time series are also considered as they may contribute useful information. Participants are people with dementia or cognitive impairment who wander, of any age, and in any care environment ‐ hospital, other institution, or their own home. Interventions comprise exit modifications that aim to function as subjective barriers to prevent the wandering of cognitively impaired people. Locks, physical restraints, electronic tagging and other types of barrier are not included. Data collection and analysis The criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies are applied independently by two reviewers. All outcomes that are meaningful to people making decisions about the care of wanderers are recorded. These include the number of exits or carer interventions, resource use, acceptability of the intervention and the effects on carer and wanderer (anxiety or distress). Heterogeneity of clinical area, of study design and of intervention was substantial. Main results No RCTs or controlled trials were found. The other experimental studies that we identified were unsatisfactory. Most were vulnerable to bias, particularly performance bias; most did not classify patients according to type or severity of dementia; in all studies, outcomes were measured only in terms of wandering frequency rather than more broadly in terms of quality of life, resource use, anxiety and distress; no studies included patients with delirium; no studies were based in patients' homes. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence that subjective barriers prevent wandering by cognitively impaired people. Plain language summary No evidence that subjective barriers prevent wandering of cognitively impaired people Cognitive impairment is part of the clinical syndrome of dementia which is due to brain disorder, often progressive and irreversible. Wandering of cognitively impaired people presents risks, and places additional demands on carers. Traditional measures to reduce wandering include drugs, restraints, locked doors and other barriers, but these can be harmful. Subjective barriers (that appear as an obstruction only to those who are cognitively impaired) may provide an inexpensive, safe, effective and ethical alternative. They include mirrors, floor stripes and camouflage of door furniture. The review found no evidence so far that subjective barriers prevent wandering and could not exclude the possibility that such barriers cause psychological harm.

AB: Abstract - Background Since the mid‐1970s, short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) for a broad range of psychological and somatic disorders have been developed and studied. Early published meta‐analyses of STPP, using different methods and samples, have yielded conflicting results, although some meta‐analyses have consistently supported an empirical basis for STPP. This is an update of a review that was last updated in 2006. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of STPP for adults with common mental disorders compared with wait‐list controls, treatments as usual and minimal contact controls in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To specify the differential effects of STPP for people with different disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, mixed disorders and personality disorder) and treatment characteristics (e.g. manualised versus non‐manualised therapies). Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) was searched to February 2014, this register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974‐), MEDLINE (1950‐) and PsycINFO (1967‐). We also conducted searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, DARE and Biological Abstracts (all years to July 2012) and all relevant studies (identified to 2012) were fully incorporated in this review update. We checked references from papers retrieved. We contacted a large group of psychodynamic researchers in an attempt to find new studies. Selection criteria We included all RCTs of adults with common mental disorders, in which a brief psychodynamic therapy lasting 40 or fewer hours in total was provided in individual format. Data collection and analysis Eight review authors working in pairs evaluated studies. We selected studies only if pairs of review authors agreed that the studies met inclusion criteria. We consulted a third review author if two review authors could not reach consensus. Two review authors collected data and entered it into Review Manager software. Two review authors assessed and scored risk of bias. We assessed publication bias using a funnel plot. Two review authors conducted and reviewed subgroup analyses. Main results We included 33 studies of STPP involving 2173 randomised participants with common mental disorders. Studies were of diverse conditions in which problems with emotional regulation were purported to play a causative role albeit through a range of symptom presentations. These studies evaluated STPP for this review's primary outcomes (general, somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom reduction), as well as interpersonal problems and social adjustment. Except for somatic measures in the short‐term, all outcome categories suggested significantly greater improvement in the treatment versus the control groups in the short‐term and medium‐term. Effect sizes increased in long‐term follow‐up, but some of these effects did not reach statistical significance. A relatively small number of studies (N < 20) contributed data for the outcome categories. There was also significant heterogeneity between studies in most categories, possibly due to observed differences between manualised versus non‐manualised treatments, short versus longer treatments, studies with observer‐rated versus self report outcomes, and studies employing different treatment models. Authors' conclusions There has been further study of STPP and it continues to show promise, with modest to large gains for a wide variety of people. However, given the limited data, loss of significance in some measures at long‐term follow‐up and heterogeneity between studies, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, variability in treatment delivery and treatment quality may limit the reliability of estimates of effect for STPP. Larger studies of higher quality and with specific diagnoses are warranted. Plain language summary Short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders Background Common mental disorders include anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, stress‐related physical conditions, certain behaviour disorders and personality disorders. People with these disorders tend to have problems handling difficult emotions and often respond with physical and psychic symptoms or avoidant behavioural patterns. Such patterns and emotional responses are theoretically treatable by short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) because these therapies aim to improve long‐ and short‐term problems with emotion processing, behaviour and communication/relationships with others. STPP is thought to work by making people aware of emotions, thoughts and problems with communication/relationships that are related to past and recent trauma. This in turn helps to correct problems with emotions and relationships with others. This review sought to find out whether STPP is more effective than wait‐list control (where people receive therapy after a delay during which people in the 'active' group receive the therapy), treatment as usual and minimal treatment (partial treatments not expected to provide a robust effect). Study characteristics We searched scientific databases to find all published and unpublished studies of STPP compared with wait‐list control, treatment as usual or minimal treatment up to July 2012. We searched for studies in adults over 17 years of age with common mental disorders being treated in an outpatient setting. We excluded people with psychotic disorders. Key results We included 33 studies involving 2173 people. When the results of the studies were combined and analysed, we found that there was a significantly greater improvement in the groups of people who received STPP versus the control groups, both in the short‐term (less than three months after treatment) and medium‐term (three to six months after treatment). These benefits generally appeared to increase in the long‐term. However, some results did not remain statistically significant in the long‐term and, in addition, the studies varied in terms of their design, meaning that these conclusions are tentative and need confirmation with further research. The finding that a short‐term psychological therapy treatment may be broadly applicable and effective is of importance in the atmosphere of current global healthcare and economic restrictions. Quality of the evidence The studies were of variable quality.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that is characterised by positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions; negative symptoms, such as flattened affect, thought disorder (disrupted speech), and lack of motivation; and cognitive symptoms, such as problems with memory and attention. Schizophrenia can occur as an isolated episode, or as a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, and is associated with impairment in psychosocial and occupational functioning. Although antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for people with schizophrenia, in most countries mental health services usually provide a range of add‐on interventions, including occupational therapy. This is a complex intervention designed to support and enable continued participation in daily life through engagement in activities and occupations meaningful to the individual. Occupational therapists are professionals trained to deliver therapy where the emphasis is on improving occupational function and participation rather than treating symptoms, and uses a wide range of methods based on the needs of individuals. However, similar interventions may also be delivered by staff not trained as occupational therapists. Objectives To examine the effects of occupational therapy delivered by occupational therapists compared to occupational therapy delivered by any other person for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers) on 4 November 2016 and 26 July 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials evaluating the functional or clinical outcomes of occupational therapy, or both, for people with schizophrenia delivered by occupational therapists compared with occupational therapy for people with schizophrenia delivered by anyone other than occupational therapists. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. Main results The search yielded 1633 records. Of these, we retrieved 17 full‐text reports (14 studies) for further scrutiny, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Currently there are no randomised controlled trials comparing delivery of occupational therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia by occupational therapists with delivery of similar interventions by anyone other than occupational therapists. Research studies employing methodologically robust trial designs are needed to establish whether or not there are better outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with occupational therapy that is delivered by trained occupational therapists. Plain language summary Occupational therapy for schizophrenia provided by occupational therapists compared to others Review question Is there good‐quality evidence that occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists rather than anyone else? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition with a range of symptoms including hearing voices, unusual beliefs, paranoia, disorganised thinking or speech, and loss of motivation. In addition to people diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving medical treatments, services that support such individuals often provide further therapies such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help improve the functioning and ability to take part in meaningful activities of people with schizophrenia, rather than focusing on reducing symptoms. Occupational therapy may be provided by specialist professionals trained as occupational therapists. However, similar therapy may be provided by other people who are not trained occupational therapists (e.g. doctors, nurses, other allied health professionals, or support staff). We wanted to find out whether there were any differences between the effectiveness of occupational therapy provided by occupational therapists and similar therapy provided by people not trained as occupational therapists. Searching for evidence On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. Evidence found We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full‐text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies. Conclusions At present there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to permit a judgement as to whether occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists compared to anyone else. Research is needed to answer this question and to help service providers plan future services that include occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background Panic disorder (PD) is a common type of anxiety disorder, characterized by unexpected and repeated panic attacks or fear of future panic attacks, or both. Individuals with PD are often resistant to pharmacological or psychological treatments and this can lead to the disorder becoming a chronic and disabling illness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can deliver sustained and spatially selective current to suppress or induce cortical excitability, and its therapeutic effect on pathological neuronal activity in people with PD has already been examined in case studies and clinical trials. However, a systematic review is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of rTMS for PD. Objectives To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for panic disorder (PD) in adults aged 18 to 65 years, either as a monotherapy or as an augmentation strategy. Search methods An electronic search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) was conducted to 19 February 2014. The CCDANCTR includes reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years). Additional searches were conducted in Psyndex and the main Chinese medical databases. Selection criteria RCTs or quasi‐randomised trials evaluating rTMS for PD in people aged between 18 and 65 years, either as a monotherapy or as an augmentation strategy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data and verified the data by cross‐checking. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. For binary data, we calculated fixed‐effect model risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated fixed‐effect model standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% CI. Main results Two RCTs (n = 40) were included in this review. The included trials compared rTMS with sham rTMS; no trials comparing rTMS with active treatments (electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy) met our inclusion criteria. Both included studies used 1 Hz rTMS over the right dorso‐lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for two or four weeks as an augmentation treatment for PD. However, in both studies the data for the primary outcome, panic symptoms as measured by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), were skewed and could not be pooled for a quantitative analysis. For this primary outcome one trial with 25 participants reported a superior effect of rTMS in reducing panic symptoms compared with sham rTMS (t = 3.04, df = 16.57, P = 0.007), but this trial had a 16% dropout rate and so was deemed as having a high risk of attrition bias. The other trial found that all 15 participants exhibited a reduction in panic symptoms but there was no significant difference between rTMS and sham rTMS (Mann Whitney U test, P > 0.05). Regarding the acceptability of rTMS, no significant difference was found between rTMS and sham rTMS in dropout rates or in reports of side effects. The quality of evidence contributing to this review was assessed as very low. Assessments of the risk of bias for the two studies were hampered by the lack of information provided in the reports, especially on methods of sequence generation and whether allocation concealment had been applied. Of the remaining sources of bias, we considered one of the studies to have been at risk of attrition bias. Authors' conclusions Only two RCTs of rTMS were available and their sample sizes were small. The available data were insufficient for us to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of rTMS for PD. Further trials with large sample sizes and adequate methodology are needed to confirm the effectiveness of rTMS for PD. Plain language summary Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for panic disorder Why is this review important? Panic disorder is a common mental disorder and its lifetime prevalence is 5.1%. The major characteristic of panic disorder is the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks with consequent anxiety about experiencing another attack. Despite major advances in the treatment, many people with panic disorder do not respond well to either medication or psychological therapy. In recent years, an association was found between panic symptoms and increased activity in the right frontal region of the brain. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new technique for the stimulation of the central nervous system. It works through placing an electromagnetic coil against the scalp, which generates a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce localised electrical currents. Low frequency rTMS can reduce this increased activity in the brain and so rTMS is emerging as a new way to treat people with panic disorder. Some studies have investigated the effect of rTMS on patients with PD and observed a reduction in anxiety levels. The aim of this review was to combine the results of all the randomised controlled trials of rTMS for panic disorder to investigate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. Who will be interested in this review? People affected by panic disorder. General practitioners (GPs). Professionals working in adult mental health services. Families and friends of people who suffer from major depression. What questions does this review aim to answer? Is rTMS effective in treating adults with panic disorder, either on its own or in combination with other treatments? Which studies were included in the review? We searched for all the relevant studies on rTMS for panic disorder in people aged 18 to 65 years. Our search found only two studies which met our inclusion criteria and they were included in this review. Information about the way that the studies were conducted were not very well detailed and for one study there was a large proportion of people whose data were not incorporated in to the analysis. The two studies involved a total of 40 people with panic disorder and reported the effect of rTMS on panic symptoms after two or four weeks of rTMS. Both studies used low‐frequency rTMS which lasted 30 minutes and was applied to a region of the brain called the right prefrontal site. Most participants were also taking antidepressant drugs or receiving psychological therapy. No studies compared the differences between rTMS and any other therapy, such as medication, psychological therapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). What does the evidence from the review tell us? One study found that all patients improved during the study period, but the treatment effect did not differ between the group who received rTMS and the group who received sham rTMS. The other study administered more sessions and reported higher levels of improvement of panic symptoms in those people who received rTMS compared to those who received sham rTMS. Although neither trial reported any serious side effects, they provided only very low quality evidence for adverse event outcomes. On the basis of the limited quality of the evidence available we were unable to determine how safe rTMS is. The limited information available from these two studies is insufficient to conclude whether rTMS is effective in reducing the severity of panic disorder symptoms. The main limitation of this review was that the number of people with panic disorder who were involved was too small. What should happen next? To find out more about rTMS for panic disorder, there is a need for more studies to be carried out which involve larger numbers of people and compare sham rTMS with real rTMS.

AB: Abstract - Background Chlorpromazine and haloperidol are benchmark antipsychotic drugs. Both are said to be equally effective when used at equivalent doses, but have different side‐effect profiles. Objectives To compare the effects of haloperidol and chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (August 2006). We searched references of all included studies for further trials. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of relevant trials. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials that compared haloperidol with chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by at least two reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. We independently extracted data. For dichotomous data we calculated the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We found 14 relevant studies, mostly of short duration, poorly reported and conducted in the 1970s (total n=794 participants). Nine of these compared oral formulations of both compounds, and five compared intramuscular formulations. Haloperidol was associated with significantly fewer people leaving the studies early (13 RCTs, n=476, RR 0.26 CI 0.08 to 0.82). The efficacy outcome 'no significant improvement' tended to favour haloperidol, but this difference was not statistically significant (9 RCTs, n=400, RR 0.81 CI 0.64 to 1.04). Movement disorders were more frequent in the haloperidol groups ('at least one extrapyramidal side effect': 6 RCTs, n=37, RR 2.2 CI 1.1 to 4.4, NNH 5 CI 3 to 33), while chlorpromazine was associated with more frequent hypotension (5 RCTs, n=175, RR 0.31 CI 0.11 to 0.88, NNH 7 CI 4 to 25). Similar trends were found when studies comparing intramuscular formulations and studies comparing oral formulations were analysed separately. Authors' conclusions Given that haloperidol and chlorpromazine are global standard antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia, it is surprising that less than 800 people have been randomised to a comparison and that incomplete reporting still makes it difficult for anyone to draw clear conclusions on the comparative effects of these drugs. However, it seems that haloperidol causes more movement disorders than chlorpromazine, while chlorpromazine is significantly more likely to lead to hypotonia. We are surprised to have to say that we feel further, large, well designed, conducted and reported studies are required. Plain language summary Haloperidol versus chlorpromazine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia can be a long‐term, chronic illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. The most common treatment of this condition is using antipsychotics. In the developed world there is a large choice of antipsychotics including some that are quite expensive, whereas in the developing world the older and cheaper drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are still used for the majority of the people. In addition, most new medications are tested for their effectiveness against haloperidol or chlorpromazine. This review looks at clinical trials comparing people with schizophrenia who have been treated with either chlorpromazine or haloperidol, in tablet form or as injection into muscle but not by long acting injection. There were 14 trials identified containing a total of 794 people. The trials varied in length from ‘several hours’ to 36 weeks but only two were six months or longer. The most recent trial was published in 1994, and the earliest 1962. As diagnosis of schizophrenia has changed over the years, some people in the early trials may have diagnoses other than schizophrenia by today’s criteria. Overall the mental health and general functioning of people taking chlorpromazine or haloperidol improved. Compared to nowadays fewer people in both arms of the trial left the study early but those taking chlorpromazine were statistically more likely to do so. This was also the case when the oral medications were analysed on their own, but not in the case of the injected form. There was a suggestion that people may leave the study because of either adverse events or because the treatment did not work well. Haloperidol had statistically more movement side effects while chlorpromazine was statistically more likely to cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Although these trials show both haloperidol and chlorpromazine to be effective drugs for schizophrenia, a lot of data were not able to be used because some measures were not reported. Therefore the area would benefit from a new trial with a large number of people and lasting at least a year.

AB: Abstract - Background Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic anxiety disorder associated with significant morbidity, social impairment and lower quality of life. Psychological treatments are a frequently used approach for OCD. Objectives To perform a systematic review of randomised trials of psychological treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in comparison with treatment as usual. Search methods We conducted an electronic search of CCDANCTR‐Studies (31/10/2006), and other databases. We searched reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Published and unpublished randomised trials of psychological treatments versus treatment as usual for adults with a diagnosis of OCD Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently throughout the selection of trials and data extraction. Findings were compared and disagreements were discussed with a third review author. Full data extraction, using a standardised data extraction sheet, was performed on all studies included in the review. Results were synthesised using Review Manager software. For dichotomous data, odds ratios were calculated. For continuous data, effect sizes were obtained and the standardised mean difference, with 95% confidence intervals, was calculated. Fixed and random effects models were used to pool the data. Reasons for heterogeneity in studies were explored and sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding trials of lower quality. Main results Eight studies (11 study comparisons) were identified, all of which compared cognitive and/or behavioural treatments versus treatment as usual control groups. Seven studies (ten comparisons) had usable data for meta‐analyses. These studies demonstrated that patients receiving any variant of cognitive behavioural treatment exhibited significantly fewer symptoms post‐treatment than those receiving treatment as usual (SMD ‐1.24, 95% CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.87, I² test for heterogeneity 33.4%). Different types of cognitive and/or behavioural treatments showed similar differences in effect when compared with treatment as usual. The overall treatment effect appeared to be influenced by differences in baseline severity. Authors' conclusions The findings of this review suggest that psychological treatments derived from cognitive behavioural models are an effective treatment for adult patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Larger high quality randomised controlled trials involving longer follow up periods are needed, to further test cognitive behavioural treatments, and other psychological approaches, in comparison to each other and control conditions. Future trials should examine the predictors of response to each treatment, and also conduct cost‐effectiveness evaluations. Plain language summary Psychological treatments compared with treatment as usual for obsessive compulsive disorder Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder characterised by recurrent obsessions, such as persistent thoughts, impulses or mental images, that promote anxiety, together with compulsions, such as repetitive behaviours or mental acts, that are performed in response to the obsessions. Currently the most commonly used therapies for OCD are pharmacological therapies, followed by psychotherapies, particularly cognitive behavioural approaches. We reviewed studies that compared psychological interventions to treatment as usual groups who either received no treatment, or were on a waiting list for treatment or received usual care. We found eight studies, which together suggested that cognitive and/or behavioural treatments were better than treatment as usual conditions at reducing clinical symptoms. Baseline OCD severity and depressive symptom level predicted the degree of response. However, the conclusions were based on a small number of randomised controlled trials with small sample sizes. There were no trials of other forms of psychological treatment such as psychodynamic therapy and client‐centred therapy, and a lack of available evidence for the long‐term effectiveness of psychological treatments.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication is used extensively to treat people with serious mental illnesses. However, it is associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders. Because of this, many people treated with antipsychotic medication also receive anticholinergic drugs in order to reduce some of the associated movement side‐effects. However, there is also a suggestion from animal experiments that the chronic administration of anticholinergics could cause tardive dyskinesia. Objectives To determine whether the use or the withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs (benzhexol, benztropine, biperiden, orphenadrine, procyclidine, scopolamine, or trihexylphenidyl) are clinically effective for the treatment of people with both antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses. Search methods We retrieved 712 references from searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials including the registries of clinical trials (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017). We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports identified in the search if they were controlled trials dealing with people with antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness who had been randomly allocated to (a) anticholinergic medication versus placebo (or no intervention), (b) anticholinergic medication versus any other intervention for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, or (c) withdrawal of anticholinergic medication versus continuation of anticholinergic medication. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from included trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The previous version of this review included no trials. We identified two trials that could be included from the 2015 and 2017 searches. They randomised 30 in‐ and outpatients with schizophrenia in the USA and Germany. Overall, the risk of bias was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting: allocation concealment was not described; generation of the sequence was not explicit; studies were not clearly blinded; and outcome data were not fully reported. Findings were sparse. One study reported on the primary outcomes and found that significantly more participants allocated to procyclidine (anticholinergic) had not improved to a clinically important extent compared with those allocated to isocarboxazid (MAO‐inhibitor) after 40 weeks' treatment (1 RCT, n = 20; RR 4.20, 95% CI 1.40 to 12.58;  very low quality evidence ); that there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of any adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32;  very low quality evidence ); or acceptability of treatment (measured by participants leaving the study early) (1 RCT, n = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32;  very low quality evidence ). The other trial compared anticholinergic withdrawal with anticholinergic continuation and found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of acceptability of treatment (measured by participants leaving the study early) (1 RCT, n = 10; RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.11 to 42.52;  very low quality evidence ). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life — outcomes designated important to patients. No studies comparing either i. anticholinergics with placebo or no treatment, or ii. studies of anticholinergic withdrawal, were found that reported on the primary outcome 'no clinically important improvement in TD symptoms and adverse events'. Authors' conclusions Based on currently available evidence, no confident statement can be made about the effectiveness of anticholinergics to treat people with antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. The same applies for the withdrawal of such medications. Whether the withdrawal of anticholinergics may benefit people with antipsychotic‐induced TD should be evaluated in a parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled randomised trial, with adequate sample size and at least 6 weeks of follow‐up. Plain language summary Anticholinergic medication for people who have tardive dyskinesia after taking antipsychotic medication Review question . Are anticholinergic drugs or withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia or other similar mental health problems. Background . People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have beliefs which are at odds with those held by people without schizophrenia (delusions). The main treatment of these symptoms are antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side‐effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term use, or high doses, of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. Many people being treated with antipsychotic medication also receive anticholinergic drugs to try to reduce some of these movement side‐effects. There is, however, evidence from animal experiments that anticholinergic drugs could cause tardive dyskinesia. Study characteristics . The review includes two small randomised studies with a total of 30 people with schizophrenia who had also developed antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Participants in one study received either the anticholinergic drug procyclidine or isocarboxacid, an antidepressant drug. One participant group in the other study was withdrawn from the anticholinergic drug biperiden whereas the other group of participants continued taking biperiden. Key results . There were sparse findings from two small and poorly reported trials. It is uncertain whether giving anticholinergic drugs is helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia for people who are taking antipsychotic medication. It is also uncertain whether the withdrawal of anticholinergic medication improves the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Quality of the evidence . Available evidence is very low or low quality, limited, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs or the withdrawal of these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia. To fully investigate whether the withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs has any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, we need more high quality research data. This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation ( mcpin.org ).

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia and related disorders affect a sizable proportion of any population. Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for these disorders. Antipsychotic medications are associated with a variety of adverse effects including tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia is difficult to treat, despite experimentation with several treatments. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been among these experimental treatments. Objectives To determine the effects of calcium channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic‐induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials comparing calcium channel blockers with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention for people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or serious mental illness who remained on their antipsychotic medication. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and estimated risk ratios of dichotomous data or mean differences (MD) of continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who left the trials early had no improvement. We also created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results Previous versions of this review included no trials. From the 2015 search, we identified three cross‐over trials that could be included. The 2017 search found no new studies relevant to this review. The included trials randomised 47 inpatients with chronic mental illnesses in the USA and China. Trials were published in the 1990s and were of short duration (six to 10 weeks). Overall, the risk of bias was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, and attrition and outcome data were not fully reported. Findings were sparse, no study reported on the primary outcome 'no clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms,' but two small studies (37 participants) found no difference on the tardive dyskinesia symptoms scale Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores between diltiazem or flunarizine and placebo after three to four weeks' treatment (MD ‐0.71, 95% CI ‐2.68 to 1.26, very low quality evidence). Only one study randomising 20 participants reported on adverse events, and reported that there were no adverse events with flunarizine or with placebo (very low quality evidence). One study with 18 participants reported no events of deterioration in mental state with diltiazem or with placebo (very low quality evidence). No studies reported on acceptability of treatment or on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or personalised quality of life outcomes designated important to patients. Authors' conclusions Available evidence from randomised controlled trials is extremely limited and very low quality, conclusions cannot be drawn. The effects of calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia are unknown. Their use is experimental and should only be given in the context of well‐designed randomised trials. Plain language summary Calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question Are a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) useful for the treatment of an unpleasant side effect, tardive dyskinesia, in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems? Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic medicines. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high‐dose of antipsychotic medicines, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. A group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been used as experimental treatments for tardive dyskinesia. Study characteristics We searched for clinical trials (up to April 2017) using Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of trials. The review includes three small, short trials published in the 1990s. The trials randomised 47 people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed tardive dyskinesia because they were taking antipsychotic medicines. The treatments the participants received were the calcium channel blockers, flunarizine, nifedipine or diltiazem hydrochloride or placebo (dummy treatment). Key results A small set of very low quality data were available from three small and poorly reported trials. Currently, it is uncertain whether calcium channel blockers are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia that is caused by taking antipsychotic medicines. Therefore, the use of calcium channel blockers for this purpose remains experimental. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. To fully investigate whether calcium channel blockers have any positive effects, there would have to be more well‐designed, conducted and reported clinical trials.

AB: Abstract - Background People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. Objectives To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. Main results We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. Authors' conclusions Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them. Plain language summary Self management interventions for type 2 diabetes in adults with severe mental illness Review question What are the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for adults with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness? Background Diabetes is one of the most common long‐term conditions, affecting around 415 million people worldwide. People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop diabetes as those without mental health problems because of many factors, including antipsychotic medication side effects and inadequate 'lifestyle' such as poor diet and low levels of physical activity. Once diagnosed, type 2 diabetes is managed through a combination of medication and behavioural changes. When diabetes is poorly managed, people can develop severe and life‐threatening complications. Healthcare providers have developed patient education programmes to help people to self manage their diabetes, and to reduce the likelihood of these complications. Although many programmes for type 2 diabetes have been found to be effective, little is known about programmes that have been specifically tailored to meet the needs of people with severe mental illness. Study characteristics We identified one study, which recruited 64 adults with type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers compared usual care plus information leaflets with a 24‐week education programme delivered once a week for 90 minutes (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training). This programme provided basic diabetes education and information about nutrition and exercise. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years old. People in the included study were monitored for six months after the programme ended. This evidence is up to date as of 07 March 2016. Key results In summary, few studies have evaluated the effects of diabetes self management programmes for adults with severe mental illness. Study authors of the single included study did not report diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. They described small improvements in body mass index and body weight, as well as in diabetes knowledge and self efficacy. Current evidence is insufficient to show that these types of programmes can help people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness to better manage their diabetes and its consequences. Quality of the evidence We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low, mainly because of the small numbers of included studies and participants, and because reported study results showed inconsistency.

AB: Abstract - Background Delirium occurs in 30% of hospitalised patients and is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality. The results of uncontrolled studies have been unclear, with some suggesting that benzodiazepines may be useful in controlling non‐alcohol related delirium. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects of benzodiazapines in the treatment of non‐alcohol withdrawal related delirium. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 26 February 2008 using the search terms: (deliri* or confusion) and (benzo* or lorazepam," or "alprazolam" or "ativan" or diazepam or valium or chlordiazepam). The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from major health databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, LILACS) as well as many ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria Trials had to be unconfounded, randomized and with concealed allocation of subjects. Additionally, selected trials had to have assessed patients pre‐ and post‐treatment. Where crossover design was present, only data from the first part of the trial were to be examined. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted data from included trials. Data were pooled where possible, and were to be analysed using appropriate statistical methods. Odd ratios or average differences were to be calculated. Only "intention to treat" data were to be included. Main results Only one trial satisfying the selection criteria could be identified. In this trial, comparing the effect of the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, with dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha‐2‐adrenergic receptor agonist, on delirium among mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients, dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with an increased number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days compared with lorazepam treated patients (dexmedetomidine patients, average seven days; lorazepam patients, average three days; P = 0.01). One partially controlled study showed no advantage of a benzodiazepine (alprazolam) compared with neuroleptics in treating agitation associated with delirium, and another partially controlled study showed decreased effectiveness of a benzodiazepine (lorazepam), and increased adverse effects, compared with neuroleptics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine) for the treatment of acute confusion. Authors' conclusions No adequately controlled trials could be found to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non‐alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients, and at this time benzodiazepines cannot be recommended for the control of this condition. Because of the scarcity of trials with randomization of patients, placebo control, and adequate concealment of allocation of subjects, it is clear that further research is required to determine the role of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non‐alcohol withdrawal related delirium. Plain language summary At this time, benzodiazepines cannot be recommended for the treatment of non‐alcohol related delirium A systematic review of benzodiazepine treatment of non‐alcohol related delirium discovered very few trials (one randomized, controlled study of mechanically ventilated patients, and thus poorly reflective of delirious patients as a whole; and two partially controlled studies), the results of which indicate that at this time there is no evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non‐alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients.

AB: Abstract - Background Nicergoline is an ergot derivative currently in use in over fifty countries for more than three decades, for the treatment of cognitive, affective, and behavioral disorders of older people. It was initially considered as a vasoactive drug and mainly prescribed for cerebrovascular disorders. Recent findings suggest other actions which has provided a rationale for the use of nicergoline for the treatment of various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease. Objectives To determine whether there is evidence of efficacy of nicergoline in the treatment of dementia and other age‐associated forms of cognitive decline,and to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug. Search methods 1. Electronic databases search. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (which contains citations from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych LIT, and hand searches of geriatric, dementia, psychogeriatric journals, and conference abstracts) was searched using the following terms: 'Nicergoline', 'Sermion'.   2. Reference search. The reference lists of all obtained studies was checked.   3. Pharmaceutical company Pharmacia & Upjohn, owners of the rights to produce and market nicergoline in various different countries, was asked to provide data and reports of clinical trials. In case of unavailability of numerical data in published studies, the authors of each paper, were asked for any published or unpublished data. Selection criteria ‐ All unconfounded, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, published and unpublished trials were sought. Non‐randomized trials were excluded. Open trials were considered for inclusion if patients were randomized to the different treatment groups.   ‐ All patients diagnosed as having dementia or other cognitive disorder defined according to classification criteria accepted at the time of each study.   ‐ Nicergoline given at any dose for more than one day with placebo control. Type of outcome variables: 1. Cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests).   2. Clinical impression (such as CIBIC or other clinical global measures of change).   3. Functional performance including dependency.   4. Behavioural disturbance.   5. Safety and acceptability as measured by the incidence of adverse effects (including side‐effects) leading to withdrawal.   6. Death   7. Effect on carer   8. Use of services   9. Quality of life. Data collection and analysis A comprehensive search of the international literature and the producing company archives has been performed to identify all possible sources of data for this review. Only those trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of belonging to either category A or B of allocation concealment, as defined by the Cochrane Organisation, were examined for data extraction by one reviewer. If there was doubt then the other reviewer was consulted. Data availability restricted analyses to 'completers' analyses for the outcome measures. Outcomes able to be assessed included: Behaviour, Cognition, Clinical Judgment, Tolerability, EEG. Main results The Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Scale (SCAG) was the outcome used in the largest number of patients (814 patients). The results from these studies were homogeneous in nature despite including patients observed for periods of time ranging from 2 months to 12 months. There was a difference in favour of the active treatment in reducing the behavioural symptoms described by this scale, ‐5.18 points [‐8.03, ‐2.33]. This scale has a maximum of 133 points. The therapeutic effects of nicergoline seem to be evident by 2 months of treatment and maintained for 6 months. In general other behavioural outcome measures which include the GRS, the IADL, and the MACC and were episodically used in few studies, failed to demonstrate statistically significant results although there was a trend favouring treatment.   Cognitive assessment has been performed in a moderate number of patients with the MMSE (261 patients) and the ADAS‐Cog (342 patients). No significant heterogeneity was found for these trials, despite the trials extending over periods of treatment of 3 to 12 months. There was a difference between treatment and control groups on the MMSE favouring nicergoline treatment. At 12 months the effect size was 2.86 [0.98, 4.74] The effect size for the ADAS‐Cog, used exclusively with Alzheimer's disease patients, did not reveal a significant benefit. At 12 months the trend favoured treatment (‐1.64 [‐4.62, 1.34]). The other results from various cognitive measures tended to favour nicergoline but this was based on a small number of cases.   The clinical impression of change obtained from a total of 921 patients was homogeneous across the studies, despite reflecting changes over periods of time ranging from 2 to 12 months. The Peto odd ratio for improvement in the subjects treated with nicergoline over these varying time periods was 3.33 [2.50, 4.43].   Tolerability assessed in 1427 patients was homogeneous across all studies and demonstrated a mildly increased risk of adverse events on treatment, OR 1.51[1.10, 2.07]. Authors' conclusions The clinical studies on nicergoline were carried out with diverse criteria and modalities of evaluation. Despite this, the 14 studies included in this review, have presented generally consistent results. Results of this meta‐analysis provide some evidence of positive effects of nicergoline on cognition and behaviour and these effects are supported by an effect on clinical global impression. There was some evidence that there were increased risk of adverse effects associated with nicergoline. These results were obtained on older patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioural impairment of various clinical origins, including chronic cerebrovascular disorders and Alzheimer's dementia. The few studies specifically performed on patients with Alzheimer's disease were performed with too few people to give a definitive answer to the questions concerning the use of nicergoline for this form of dementia.   This drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as MCI or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs. Plain language summary Nicergoline may improve cognition and behavioural function of people with mild to moderate dementia Nicergoline is an ergot derivative which has been registered in over 50 countries and has been used for more than three decades for the treatment of cognitive, affective, and behavioural disorders of older people. During the time it has been in use, the rationale for its clinical use has evolved. Initially regarded as a vasoactive drug, it was mainly prescribed for cerebrovascular disorders. Since then, findings suggesting a more complex pharmacological profile of nicergoline have led to its being considered for the treatment of other forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease. There is some evidence of positive effects of nicergoline on cognition and behaviour and these effects are supported by an effect on clinical global impression.There was some evidence that there was increased risk of adverse effects associated with nicergoline. This drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as MCI or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs.

AB: Abstract - Background Vinpocetine is a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine, a vinca alkaloid obtained from the leaves of the Lesser Periwinkle (Vinca minor) and discovered in the late 1960s. Although used in human treatment for over twenty years, it has not been approved by any regulatory body for the treatment of cognitive impairment. Basic sciences studies have been used to claim a variety of potentially important effects in the brain. However, despite these many proposed mechanisms and targets, the relevance of this basic science to clinical studies is unclear. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of vinpocetine in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment due to vascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, mixed (vascular and Alzheimer's disease) and other dementias. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched on 23 March 2009 using the terms vinpocetin*, cavinton, kavinton, Rgh‐4405, Tcv‐3B, "ethyl apovincaminate", vinRx, periwinkle, "myrtle vincapervinc" and cezayirmeneksesi. This register contains up to date references from major health care databases like MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as records from trials databases in the field of dementia.The manufacturers of vinpocetine were asked for information on trials of vinpocetine for dementia. In addition we tried to collect articles not listed in MEDLINE or other sources on the Internet (e.g. articles in Hungarian and Romanian). Selection criteria All human, unconfounded, double‐blind, randomized trials in which treatment with vinpocetine was administered for more than a day and compared to control in patients with vascular dementia, Alzheimer's dementia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia and other dementias. Non‐randomized trials were excluded. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by the two reviewers (SzSz and PW) and cross‐checked. Data from "washout" periods were not used for the analysis. For continuous or ordinal variables, such as cognitive test results, the main outcomes of interest were the change in score from baseline. The categorical outcome of global impression was transformed to binary data (improved or not improved) as was the occurrence of adverse effects; here the endpoint itself was of interest and the Peto method of the "typical odds ratio" was used. A test for heterogeneity of treatment effects between the trials was made if appropriate. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan version 4.1). Main results All identified studies were performed before and in the early 1990s and used various terms and criteria for cognitive decline and dementia. The three studies included in the review involved a total of 583 people with dementia treated with vinpocetine or placebo. The reports of these studies did not make possible any differentiation of effects for degenerative or vascular dementia. The results show benefit associated with treatment with vinpocetine 30 mg/day and 60 mg/day compared with placebo, but the number of patients treated for six months or more was small. Only one study extended treatment to one year. Adverse effects were inconsistently reported and without regard for relationship to dose. The available data do not demonstrate many problems of adverse effects but intention‐to‐treat data were not available for any of the trials. Authors' conclusions Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use. The drug seems to have few adverse effects at the doses used in the studies. Large studies evaluating the use of vinpocetine for people suffering from well defined types of cognitive impairment are needed to explore possible efficacy of this treatment. Plain language summary Insufficient evidence of benefits of vinpocetine for people with dementia Preclinical data of uneven quality suggest a potential beneficial effect of vinpocetine in chronic cerebrovascular diseases and on cognitive performance in a variety of animal models. Clinical trials to test these hypotheses were performed before currently used criteria for dementia had become generally accepted. The results show improvement after the treatment with vinpocetine versus placebo, but the number of demented patients treated for at least six months was small. The available data does not demonstrate many side effect problems. Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use.

Some traditional Chinese herbal medicines were developed for treating VD. Yizhi capsule is one such herbal concoction which is reported to improve clinical symptoms significantly. The efficacy and adverse effects of Yizhi capsule need to be reviewed systematically and assessed critically to inform clinical practice and guide the continued search for new treatment regimens. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and possible adverse events of 'Yizhi capsule' in treating vascular dementia. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CONAHL, LILACS, clinical trial registries and grey literature sources were searched on 8 January 2009 using the terms yi‐zhi, "yi zhi" and yizhi. In addition the review authors searched a variety of Chinese databases. Selection criteria Randomised, placebo controlled trials in which patients with vascular dementia were treated with 'Yizhi capsule' were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We telephoned study authors for missing information as to whether treatment allocation was randomised and other methodological details. Main results No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. We identified nine references to trials which included the term 'Yizhi capsule' in the description of the interventions. Two study authors were contacted by telephone and we discovered that the allocation methods they had used were not actually randomised. Four references were describing the same study. Three studies were excluded because 'positive drugs' were used as a control. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or proscribe against the use of 'Yizhi capsule' as a treatment for vascular dementia. Plain language summary There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against the use of 'Yizhi capsule' as a treatment for vascular dementia Vascular dementia (VD) is a syndrome or diagnosis that has different causes and clinical manifestations relating to several different vascular mechanisms and changes in the brain. It influences a patient's quality of life seriously. 'Yizhi capsule' is believed to be effective in the treatment of vascular dementia for improving cognitive function. The review authors found no randomised placebo controlled trials that considered 'Yizhi capsule' for patients with vascular dementia. High quality, placebo controlled research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non‐pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music‐based interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of music‐based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well‐being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment. Search methods We searched  ALOIS , the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 19 June 2017 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were carried out on 19 June 2017 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of music‐based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music. Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random‐effects models. Main results We included 22 studies with 1097 randomised participants. Twenty‐one studies with 890 participants contributed data to meta‐analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, and all were resident in institutions. Seven studies delivered an individual music intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias. At the end of treatment, we found low‐quality evidence that the interventions may improve emotional well‐being and quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.62; 9 studies, 348 participants) and reduce anxiety (SMD –0.43, 95% CI –0.72 to –0.14; 13 studies, 478 participants). We found low‐quality evidence that music‐based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect on cognition (SMD 0.15, 95% CI –0.06 to 0.36; 7 studies, 350 participants). There was moderate‐quality evidence that the interventions reduce depressive symptoms (SMD –0.27, 95% CI –0.45 to –0.09; 11 studies, 503 participants) and overall behaviour problems (SMD –0.23, 95% CI –0.46 to –0.01; 10 studies, 442 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD –0.07, 95% CI –0.24 to 0.10; 14 studies, 626 participants). The quality of the evidence on social behaviour was very low, so effects were very uncertain. The evidence for long‐term outcomes measured four or more weeks after the end of treatment was of very low quality for anxiety and social behaviour, and for the other outcomes, it was of low quality for little or no effect (with small SMDs, between 0.03 and 0.34). Authors' conclusions Providing people with dementia who are in institutional care with at least five sessions of a music‐based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms and improves overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. It may also improve emotional well‐being and quality of life and reduce anxiety, but may have little or no effect on agitation or aggression or on cognition. We are uncertain about effects on social behaviour and about long‐term effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions. Plain language summary Music‐based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia Background People with dementia gradually develop difficulties with memory, thinking, language and daily activities. Dementia is often associated with emotional and behavioural problems and may decrease a person's quality of life. In the later stages of dementia it may be difficult for people to communicate with words, but even when they can no longer speak they may still be able to hum or play along with music. Therapy involving music may therefore be especially suitable for people with dementia. Music therapists are specially qualified to work with individuals or groups of people, using music to try to help meet their physical, psychological and social needs. Other professionals may also be trained to provide similar treatments. Purpose of this review We wanted to see if we could find evidence that treatments based on music improve the emotional well‐being and quality of life of people with dementia. We were also interested in evidence about effects on emotional, behavioural, social or cognitive (e.g. thinking and remembering) problems in people with dementia. What we did We searched for clinical trials that measured these effects and in which people with dementia were randomly allocated to a music‐based treatment or to a comparison group. The comparison groups might have had no special treatment, or might have been offered a different activity. We required at least five sessions of treatment because we thought fewer sessions than five were unlikely to have much effect. We combined results of trials to estimate the effect of the treatment as accurately as possible. The evidence is current to 19 June 2017. What we found We found 22 trials to include in the review and we were able to combine results for at least some outcomes from 890 people. All of the people in the trials stayed in nursing homes or hospitals. Some trials compared music‐based treatments with usual care, and some compared them with other activities, such as cooking or painting. The quality of the trials and how well they were reported varied, and this affected our confidence in the results. First, we looked at outcomes immediately after a course of therapy ended. From our results, we could be moderately confident that music‐based treatments improve symptoms of depression and overall behavioural problems, but not specifically agitated or aggressive behaviour. They may also improve anxiety and emotional well‐being including quality of life, although we were less confident about these results. They may have little or no effect on cognition. We had very little confidence in our results on social interaction. Some studies also looked to see whether there were any lasting effects four weeks or more after treatment ended. However, there were few data and we were uncertain or very uncertain about the results. Further trials are likely to have a significant impact on what we know about the effects of music‐based treatments for people with dementia, so continuing research is important.

AB: Abstract - Background This review represents one from a family of three reviews focusing on interventions for drug‐using offenders. Many people under the care of the criminal justice system have co‐occurring mental health problems and drug misuse problems; it is important to identify the most effective treatments for this vulnerable population. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems in reducing criminal activity or drug use, or both. This review addresses the following questions. • Does any treatment for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems reduce drug use? • Does any treatment for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems reduce criminal activity? • Does the treatment setting (court, community, prison/secure establishment) affect intervention outcome(s)? • Does the type of treatment affect treatment outcome(s)? Search methods We searched 12 databases up to February 2019 and checked the reference lists of included studies. We contacted experts in the field for further information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials designed to prevent relapse of drug use and/or criminal activity among drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane . Main results We included 13 studies with a total of 2606 participants. Interventions were delivered in prison (eight studies; 61%), in court (two studies; 15%), in the community (two studies; 15%), or at a medium secure hospital (one study; 8%). Main sources of bias were unclear risk of selection bias and high risk of detection bias. Four studies compared a therapeutic community intervention versus (1) treatment as usual (two studies; 266 participants), providing moderate‐certainty evidence that participants who received the intervention were less likely to be involved in subsequent criminal activity (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.84) or returned to prison (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67); (2) a cognitive‐behavioural therapy (one study; 314 participants), reporting no significant reduction in self‐reported drug use (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.32), re‐arrest for any type of crime (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09), criminal activity (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05), or drug‐related crime (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), yielding low‐certainty evidence; and (3) a waiting list control (one study; 478 participants), showing a significant reduction in return to prison for those people engaging in the therapeutic community (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79), providing moderate‐certainty evidence. One study (235 participants) compared a mental health treatment court with an assertive case management model versus treatment as usual, showing no significant reduction at 12 months' follow‐up on an Addictive Severity Index (ASI) self‐report of drug use (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.03), conviction for a new crime (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22), or re‐incarceration to jail (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01), providing low‐certainty evidence. Four studies compared motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills with relaxation therapy (one study), a waiting list control (one study), or treatment as usual (two studies). In comparison to relaxation training, one study reported narrative information on marijuana use at three‐month follow‐up assessment. Researchers reported a main effect < .007 with participants in the motivational interviewing group, showing fewer problems than participants in the relaxation training group, with moderate‐certainty evidence. In comparison to a waiting list control, one study reported no significant reduction in self‐reported drug use based on the ASI (MD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.29) and on abstinence from drug use (RR 2.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 11.43), presenting low‐certainty evidence at six months (31 participants). In comparison to treatment as usual, two studies (with 40 participants) found no significant reduction in frequency of marijuana use at three months post release (MD ‐1.05, 95% CI ‐2.39 to 0.29) nor time to first arrest (MD 0.87, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 1.86), along with a small reduction in frequency of re‐arrest (MD ‐0.66, 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.01) up to 36 months, yielding low‐certainty evidence; the other study with 80 participants found no significant reduction in positive drug screens at 12 months (MD ‐0.7, 95% CI ‐3.5 to 2.1), providing very low‐certainty evidence. Two studies reported on the use of multi‐systemic therapy involving juveniles and families versus treatment as usual and adolescent substance abuse therapy. In comparing treatment as usual, researchers found no significant reduction up to seven months in drug dependence on the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) score (MD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐2.51 to 2.07) nor in arrests (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36), providing low‐certainty evidence (156 participants). In comparison to an adolescent substance abuse therapy, one study (112 participants) found significant reduction in re‐arrests up to 24 months (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.28), based on low‐certainty evidence. One study (38 participants) reported on the use of interpersonal psychotherapy in comparison to a psychoeducational intervention. Investigators found no significant reduction in self‐reported drug use at three months (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50), providing very low‐certainty evidence. The final study (29 participants) compared legal defence service and wrap‐around social work services versus legal defence service only and found no significant reductions in the number of new offences committed at 12 months (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.01), yielding very low‐certainty evidence. Authors' conclusions Therapeutic community interventions and mental health treatment courts may help people to reduce subsequent drug use and/or criminal activity. For other interventions such as interpersonal psychotherapy, multi‐systemic therapy, legal defence wrap‐around services, and motivational interviewing, the evidence is more uncertain. Studies showed a high degree of variation, warranting a degree of caution in interpreting the magnitude of effect and the direction of benefit for treatment outcomes. Plain language summary Interventions for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems What is the aim? To identify therapies to reduce drug use and/or criminal activity among criminal justice involved people with mental health problems. What is the key message? Therapeutic community interventions and mental health treatment courts may help people to reduce subsequent drug use and/or criminal activity. What was studied? Therapies identified to support criminal justice involved people with mental health and drug misuse problems. What are the results? ￭ When men engage with a therapeutic community intervention compared to treatment as usual, they are probably less likely to be re‐arrested or return to prison (moderate‐certainty). ￭ When women engage with a therapeutic community intervention compared to a cognitive‐behavioural course, they may not be more likely to reduce drug use, or become involved in criminal activity/drug‐related crimes (low‐certainty). ￭ When men engage with a therapeutic community compared to no intervention, they are probably less likely to return to prison (moderate‐certainty). ￭ When juveniles engage with a mental health court compared to treatment as usual, they may be less likely to commit a new crime, return to prison, or take drugs (low‐certainty). ￭ When juveniles engage with motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills, they are probably less likely to show fewer problems than receiving relaxation training (moderate‐certainty). ￭ When people engage with motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills, they may not be more likely to report a reduction/abstinence from drug use when compared to a waiting list control (low‐certainty). ￭ We are uncertain whether people engaged in motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills are not more likely to report a reduction in marijuana use, a positive drug test, or to be re‐arrested when compared to treatment as usual (very low‐certainty). ￭ When families and juveniles engage in multi‐systemic therapy, they may be more likely to report a reduction in drug dependence or to be re‐arrested in comparison to treatment as usual or group substance abuse therapy (low‐certainty). ￭ We are uncertain whether people involved in interpersonal psychotherapy are not more likely to use drugs again in comparison to a psychoeducational intervention (very low‐certainty). ￭ We are uncertain whether people involved in legal defence service and wrap‐around services are not more likely to commit new offences in comparison to a legal defence service only (very low‐certainty). Sources of funding included government institutes, research bodies, or charities. How up‐to‐date is this review? February 2019.

AB: Abstract - Background Many patients with bipolar disorder require long‐term treatment to prevent recurrence. Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat acute manic episodes. It is important to clarify whether olanzapine could have a role in long‐term prevention of manic and depressive relapses. Objectives To assess the effects of olanzapine, as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment, in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar affective disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (September 2006), MEDLINE (1966‐December 2007), EMBASE (1980‐2006), CINAHL (1982‐2006), PsycINFO (1872‐2006) and reference lists. We also contacted experts, trialists and pharmaceutical companies in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing olanzapine with placebo or other active treatment in long‐term treatment of bipolar disorder. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results Five trials (1165 participants) were included in the review. There was no statistically significant difference between olanzapine and placebo (either alone or in combination with lithium or valproate) in terms of number of participants who experienced relapse into mood episode (random effects RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, p = 0.09; 2 studies, n=460), however restricting the analysis to the trial that compared olanzapine monotherapy versus placebo, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of olanzapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69, p<0.00001). No statistically significant difference was found between olanzapine and other mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate) in preventing symptomatic relapse for any mood episode, however, olanzapine was more effective than lithium in preventing symptomatic manic relapse (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89, p = 0.01; 1 study, n=361). Olanzapine either alone or as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilisers was associated with significantly greater weight gain than placebo. By contrast, olanzapine was associated with a lower rate of manic worsening, but with a higher rate of weight increase and depression than lithium. Authors' conclusions Though based on a limited amount of information, there is evidence that olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes in patients who have responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate. However, notwithstanding these positive results, the current evidence is stronger for lithium as first line maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Plain language summary Olanzapine in long‐term treatment for bipolar disorder Bipolar affective disorder is a severe and common mental illness, characterised by periods of mania, depression and "mixed episodes" (or "dysphoric mania": a mixture of manic and depressed symptoms). Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat acute manic episodes and one commonly used antipsychotic drug that has recently been approved for use in mania in USA and Europe is olanzapine. This review considered the efficacy, acceptability and adverse effects of olanzapine in long‐term treatment of bipolar disorder in comparison with placebo or other active drug comparisons. Five trials (1165 participants) met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. Based on a limited amount of information, olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes (especially manic relapse) in patients who responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate. The olanzapine group had significantly fewer patients suffering from insomnia than the placebo group, but a significantly larger number of people suffering from weight gain. When compared with lithium, olanzapine caused more weight gain and depressive symptoms but fewer insomnia and nausea symptoms and a lower rate of manic worsening. However, considering the lack of clear findings of this review, conclusions on efficacy and acceptability of olanzapine compared to placebo, lithium or valproate cannot be made with any degree of confidence

AB: Abstract - Background Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder. Evidence that PTSD is characterised by specific psychobiological dysfunctions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medication in its treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of medication for post traumatic stress disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group specialised register (CCDANCTR‐Studies) on 18 August 2005, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), PsycINFO (1966 to 2004), and the National PTSD Center Pilots database. Reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for additional studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy for PTSD. Data collection and analysis Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by medication class, and by medication agent for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dichotomous and continuous measures were calculated using a random effects model, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Main results 35 short‐term (14 weeks or less) RCTs were included in the analysis (4597 participants). Symptom severity for 17 trials was significantly reduced in the medication groups, relative to placebo (weighted mean difference ‐5.76, 95% confidence intervals (CI) ‐8.16 to ‐3.36, number of participants (N) = 2507). Similarly, summary statistics for responder status from 13 trials demonstrated overall superiority of a variety of medication agents to placebo (relative risk 1.49, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.73, number needed to treat = 4.85, 95% CI 3.85 to 6.25, N = 1272). Medication and placebo response occurred in 59.1% (N = 644) and 38.5% (628) of patients, respectively. Of the medication classes, evidence of treatment efficacy was most convincing for the SSRIs. Medication was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptom clusters, comorbid depression and disability. Medication was also less well tolerated than placebo. A narrative review of 3 maintenance trials suggested that long term medication may be required in treating PTSD. Authors' conclusions Medication treatments can be effective in treating PTSD, acting to reduce its core symptoms, as well as associated depression and disability. The findings of this review support the status of SSRIs as first line agents in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, as well as their value in long‐term treatment. However, there remain important gaps in the evidence base, and a continued need for more effective agents in the management of PTSD. Plain language summary Medication for post traumatic stress disorder Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after exposure to significant trauma and results in enormous personal and societal costs. Although traditionally treated with psychotherapy, there is increasing recognition of a theoretical basis for medication treatments. This was a systematic review of 35 short‐term randomised controlled trials of pharmacotherapy for PTSD (4597 participants). A significantly larger proportion of patients responded to medication (59.1%) than to placebo (38.5%) (13 trials, 1272 participants). Symptom severity was significantly reduced in 17 trials (2507 participants). The largest trials showing efficacy were of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with long‐term efficacy also observed for these medications.

AB: Abstract - Background Previous Cochrane reviews have considered the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in both Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common and are distinguished primarily on the basis of whether or not parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year. Patients with both conditions have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, blocking its breakdown using cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement. Objectives To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD), and cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease falling short of dementia (CIND‐PD) (considered as separate phenomena and also grouped together as Lewy body disease). Search methods The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (on 30 August 2011) using the search terms Lewy, Parkinson, PDD, DLB, LBD. This register consists of records from major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly. Reference lists of relevant studies were searched for additional trials. Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB, PDD and CIND‐PD. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from published reports by one review author (MR). The data for each 'condition' (that is DLB, PDD or CIND‐PD) were considered separately and, where possible, also pooled. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.0. Main results Six trials met the inclusion criteria for this review, in which a total of 1236 participants were randomised. Four of the trials were of a parallel group design and two cross‐over trials were included. Four of the trials included participants with a diagnosis of PDD ( Aarsland 2002a ;  Dubois 2007 ;  Emre 2004 ;  Ravina 2005 ), of which Dubois 2007 remains unpublished (n = 550).  Leroi 2004  included patients with cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease (both with and without dementia). Patients with DLB were included in only one of the trials ( McKeith 2000 ). For global assessment, three trials comparing cholinesterase inhibitor treatment to placebo in PDD ( Aarsland 2002a ;  Emre 2004 ;  Ravina 2005 ) reported a difference in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study‐Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS‐CGIC) score of ‐0.38, favouring the cholinesterase inhibitors (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.56 to ‐0.24, P < 0.0001). A clinically meaningful improvement was observed in 19.8% of patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, compared to 14.5% of those in the placebo group. For cognitive function, a pooled estimate of the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function measures was consistent with the presence of a therapeutic benefit (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.23, P < 0.00001). There was evidence of a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with PDD (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.09, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.73, P = 0.0008) and in the single PDD and CIND‐PD trial (WMD 1.05, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.68, P = 0.01) but not in the single DLB trial. For behavioural disturbance, analysis of the pooled continuous data relating to behavioural disturbance rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.36 to ‐0.04, P = 0.01). For activities of daily living, combined data for the ADCS and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.02, P = 0.03). For safety and tolerability, those taking a cholinesterase inhibitor were more likely to experience an adverse event (318/452 versus 668/842; odds ratio (OR) 1.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.15, P = 0.0003) and to drop out (128/465 versus 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.84, P = 0.0006). Adverse events were more common amongst those taking rivastigmine (357/421 versus 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.38, P < 0.0001) but not those taking donepezil (311/421 versus 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.80, P = 0.25). Parkinsonian symptoms in particular tremor (64/739 versus 12/352; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.09, P = 0.002), but not falls (P = 0.39), were reported more commonly in the treatment group but this did not have a significant impact on the UPDRS (total and motor) scores (P = 0.71). Fewer deaths occurred in the treatment group than in the placebo group (4/465 versus 9/279; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84, P = 0.03). Authors' conclusions The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales. However, almost half of the trial data, which could potentially change this conclusion, have not been made public. The effect in DLB remains unclear. There is no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND‐PD. Plain language summary Cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for people with Parkinson's disease and dementia The clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) have much in common. As patients with DLB and PDD have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, blocking its breakdown using a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement. Six trials showed a statistically significant improvement in global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales in PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND‐PD) patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. There was no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND‐PD. In a single trial, no statistically significant improvement was observed in patients with DLB who were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and further trials are necessary to clarify the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient group.

AB: Abstract - Background Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder. It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long‐term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care settings. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) ’s Specialised Register of dementia trials ( dementia.cochrane.org/our‐trials‐register ), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost‐related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time‐to‐event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster‐RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non‐pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary. It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration‐based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12‐month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant‐months; low‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness). Authors' conclusions Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC. A software‐based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist‐led medication review, probably reduces incidence of delirium in older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the US and may not be practical in other countries or settings which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. In the educational intervention aimed at identifying risk factors for delirium and developing bespoke solutions within care homes, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence, prevalence or mortality. This evidence is based on a small feasibility trial. Our review identified three ongoing trials of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. We identified no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of multicomponent non‐pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence‐based care for this vulnerable group. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care (LTC) Review question How effective are treatments to prevent delirium in older people living in long‐term care (LTC)? Background LTC is the name used for residential homes, which provide personal care, supervision with medications and help with day‐to‐day activities, and nursing homes, which provide 24‐hour nursing care. Delirium is a common and serious illness for older people living in LTC. Delirium is a condition that causes confusion, usually over a few hours or days. Some people with delirium become quiet and sleepy while others become agitated and disorientated, so it can be a very distressing condition. Delirium can increase the chances of being admitted to hospital, developing dementia and can increase the risk of death. Importantly, studies of people in hospital have shown that it is possible to prevent around a third of cases of delirium by providing an environment and care plan that target the main delirium risk factors, including, providing better lighting and signs to avoid disorientation; avoiding unnecessary use of catheters to help prevent infection; and avoiding certain medications which increase the risk of delirium. This review has searched for and assessed research on preventing delirium in older people living in LTC. Study characteristics The evidence is current to February 2019. We found three studies that included 3851 participants. Two studies took place in the US and one study in the UK. One study tested whether delirium could be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring hydration was maintained. There were 98 people in the study, which lasted four weeks. One study tested the effect of a computer program which searched for prescriptions of medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium, to enable a pharmacist to adjust or stop them. There were 3538 people in the study, which lasted 12 months. One study tested an enhanced educational intervention which included learning sessions on delirium with care home staff and group meetings to identity targets for preventing delirium. There were 215 people in the study, which lasted 16 months. Key findings It was not possible to determine if the hydration intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium. This was a small study of short duration with serious design problems. The study of a computerised medication search programme probably reduced delirium, but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls. A potential problem is that it might not be possible to use this computer program in different countries that do not have similar computer systems available. It was not possible to determine if the enhanced education intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium and there was no clear reduction in the number of deaths. The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions. This is based on findings from a small study. Quality of the evidence There is very low‐quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme may reduce the incidence of delirium. There is no clear evidence for reducing hospitalisations, mortality or falls. There is very low‐quality evidence of the effectiveness of an enhanced educational intervention for reducing delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence for reducing hospital admissions. As this review only found a small number of research studies, we recommend that further research be conducted, testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people in LTC.

AB: Abstract - Background A large and growing number of older people across the world suffer from schizophrenia. Recommendations for their treatment are largely based on data extrapolated from studies of the use of antipsychotic medications in younger populations. In addition most manufacturers of such medications recommend prescription of reduced doses to the elderly. The evidence base for these assumptions is unclear and raises obvious questions regarding the appropriateness of such prescribing practice. Objectives To find and assimilate good evidence of the effects of antipsychotic medication for treatment of schizophrenia in people over 65 years of age. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (May 2003). We inspected references of all included studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria All clinical randomised trials evaluating antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses in older people. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data, the random effects, relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results Two hundred and fifty two elderly people with schizophrenia participated in three relevant randomised controlled studies. We were unable to extract usable data on quality of life, satisfaction, service use, or economic outcomes. One small study (n=18) compared thioridazine with remoxipride (RR leaving the study early 1.0 CI 0.07 to 13.6). A second study (n=175) compared risperidone with olanzapine. Global state 'not improved/worse' was not significantly different between treatments (n= 171, RR 1.26 CI 0.8 to 1.9); mental state PANSS total endpoint scores were also equivocal (n=171, RR 0.98 CI 0.76 to 1.26) as were all cognitive function tests. The third study (subset n=59) compared olanzapine with haloperidol and mental state change scores (BPRS WMD ‐3.60 CI ‐10.8 to 3.6; PANSS WMD ‐6.00 CI ‐18.3 to 6.3) were equivocal. Authors' conclusions Antipsychotics may be widely used in the treatment of elderly people with schizophrenia, however, based on this systematic review, there are little robust data available to guide the clinician with respect to the most appropriate drug to prescribe. Clearly reported large short, medium and long‐term randomised controlled trials with participants, interventions and primary outcomes that are familiar to those wishing to help elderly people with schizophrenia are long overdue. Plain language summary Antipsychotic medication for elderly people with schizophrenia Since the early 1950's the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia has been drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. Although effective in controlling voices and fixed, false beliefs, these drugs are reported as having potentially disabling adverse effects such as tremor, stiffness and slowing of movement. The newer generation of drugs are reputed to be freer from these problems. This is particularly important for older people, who are more likely to experience adverse effects. Most manufacturers recommend prescription of reduced doses in the elderly. This review examines trials of these drugs for the treatment of elderly people with schizophrenia. We found three small, short trials. These did not have much information that was usable and we really could not draw any firm conclusions, except that such studies are possible and more are needed as a matter of urgency.

AB: Abstract - Background Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) may complicate a patient's postoperative recovery in several ways. Monitoring of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) or evoked potential (EP) indices may prevent or minimize POD and POCD, probably through optimization of anaesthetic doses. Objectives To assess whether the use of processed EEG or auditory evoked potential (AEP) indices (bispectral index (BIS), narcotrend index, cerebral state index, state entropy and response entropy, patient state index, index of consciousness, A‐line autoregressive index, and auditory evoked potentials (AEP index)) as guides to anaesthetic delivery can reduce the risk of POD and POCD in non‐cardiac surgical or non‐neurosurgical adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia compared with standard practice where only clinical signs are used. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registry databases up to 28 March 2017. We updated this search in February 2018, but these results have not been incorporated in the review. Selection criteria We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing any method of processed EEG or evoked potential techniques (entropy, BIS, AEP etc.) against a control group where clinical signs were used to guide doses of anaesthetics in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing general anaesthesia for non‐cardiac or non‐neurosurgical elective operations. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: occurrence of POD; and occurrence of POCD. Secondary outcomes included: all‐cause mortality; any postoperative complications; and postoperative length of stay. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2929 participants comparing processed EEG or EP indices‐guided anaesthesia with clinical signs‐guided anaesthesia. There are five ongoing studies and one study awaiting classification. Anaesthesia administration guided by the indices from a processed EEG (bispectral index) probably reduces the risk of POD within seven days after surgery with risk ratio (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17, 95% CI 11 to 34; 2197 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality of evidence). Three trials also showed the lower rate of POCD at 12 weeks after surgery (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; NNTB 38, 95% CI 21 to 289; 2051 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), but it is uncertain whether processed EEG indices reduce POCD at one week (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 3 trials; 1989 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and at 52 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.80; 1 trial; 59 participants; very low quality of evidence). There may be little or no effect on all‐cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64; 1 trial; 1155 participants; low‐quality evidence). One trial suggested a lower risk of any postoperative complications with processed EEG (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 902 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). There may be little or no effect on reduced postoperative length of stay (mean difference −0.2 days, 95% CI −2.02 to 1.62; 1155 participants; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐quality evidence that optimized anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non‐cardiac surgical and non‐neurosurgical procedures. We found moderate‐quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these patients. The effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery is uncertain. There are no data available for patients under 60 years. Further blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate strategies for the amelioration of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and their consequences such as dementia (including Alzheimer's disease (AD)) in both non‐elderly (below 60 years) and elderly (60 years or over) adult patients. The one study awaiting classification and five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Optimized anaesthesia depth guided by brain electrical activity for protection against postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in adults Review question We wanted to discover whether using brain electrical activity monitoring to guide doses of anaesthetics can reduce the risk of postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in adults undergoing general anaesthesia for non‐cardiac and non‐neurological surgical procedures.    Background Postoperative delirium (POD) is a disturbed state of mind which occurs a few days after surgery. POD involves a fluctuating course of confusion and disorganized behaviour. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a decline in the ability of a person to think clearly after an operation. This may persist for weeks or months. POCD can affect a person's concentration, attention, memory, learning, and the speed of their movement and mental responses. POD and POCD can complicate the quality of a person's recovery from anaesthesia, as well as the quality of their life after surgery. Processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors generate numerical values of brain electrical activity. The number provides information about the depth of anaesthesia during surgery, and is used to guide the dose of anaesthetic given. This is to prevent someone receiving either too small or too large a dose of anaesthetics. Search date The evidence is current to March 2017. We found six completed studies, five ongoing studies, and one awaiting classification. Study characteristics All six completed studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted in 2929 male or female participants undergoing a surgical procedure and aged 60 years or over. An RCT is a study (or trial) which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people taking part in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation, or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. RCTs provide the most reliable evidence. Key results Results from three studies (2529 participants) indicate that using the processed EEG to help deliver the optimal depth of anaesthesia could reduce the incidence of POD from 21.3% to 15.2%. Results from three studies (2051 participants) indicate that this could also reduce the incidence of POCD at three months from 9.1% to 6.4%. Quality of the evidence Our review provides moderate‐quality evidence that anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non‐cardiac and non‐neurological surgical procedures. We found some moderate‐quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these participants. There is insufficient evidence supporting the effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery or in younger patients.

AB: Abstract - Background This review considers the use of day hospitals as an alternative to outpatient care. Two types of day hospital are covered by the review: 'day treatment programmes' and 'transitional' day hospitals. Day treatment programmes offer more intense treatment for people who have failed to respond to outpatient care. Transitional day hospitals offer time‐limited care to people who have just been discharged from inpatient care. Objectives To assess effects of day hospital care as an alternative to continuing outpatient care for people with schizophrenia and and other similar severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2009) and references of all identified studies for further citations. If necessary, we also contacted authors of trials for further information. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing day hospital care with outpatient care for those with schizophrenia and other similar severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted and cross‐checked data independently. We analysed dichotomous data using fixed‐effect relative risk (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI). If continuous data were included, we analysed this data using the random‐effects weighted mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. Main results We identified four relevant trials all dating from before 1986 (total n=309 participants); all but one of which (n=37) evaluated day treatment centres. Across time less people allocated to day hospital care tend to be admitted to hospital (beyond one year: n=242, 2 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.56 to 0.89 day treatment centres) but data are heterogeneous (I 2  =74% P=0.05) and should not be taken into account. Data on time spent as an inpatient seem to support this finding but are poorly reported. We found no clear difference between day hospital and outpatient care for the outcome of ‘lost to follow up’ (at six months: n=147, 3 RCTs, RR 0.97 CI 0.48 to 1.95; at 12 months: n=117, 2 RCTs, RR 0.97 CI 0.48 to 1.95 day treatment centres / transitional day hospital). Scale derived findings on social functioning are equivocal (SAS: n=37, 1 RCT, MD 0.36 CI ‐0.07 to 0.79 transitional day hospital) but there was some suggestion from small studies that day hospital care may decrease the risk of unemployment (at 12 months: n=80, 1 RCT, RR 0.86 CI 0.69 to 1.06 day treatment centre). Different measures of mental state showed no convincing effect (Symptom Check List: n=30, 1 RCT, MD ‐90 0.31 CI ‐0.20 to 0.82 day treatment centre). Poorly reported economic data from decades ago suggested that day hospitals were more costly to establish and run than outpatient care but took no account of other costs such as inpatient stay. Authors' conclusions Evidence is limited and dated. Day hospital care may help avoid inpatient care but data are lacking on missing on a raft of outcomes that are now considered important, such as quality of life, satisfaction, healthy days, and cost. Plain language summary Day hospital versus outpatient care for people with schizophrenia Psychiatric day hospitals offer care that is less restrictive than inpatient care but more intense than outpatient care. Day hospitals can be used to provide more intense/specialised outpatient care to people resistant to treatment (day treatment programmes) or to those needing long‐term care (day care centres). They can also bridge the gap between inpatient and outpatient care (transitional day hospitals). This review compared day hospital care (in day treatment centres and transitional day hospitals) to outpatient care. Overall there was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the three types of day hospital care had substantial advantages over outpatient care.

AB: Abstract - Background Delivering the diagnosis of a serious illness is an important skill in most fields of medicine, including mental health. Research has found that communication skills can impact on a person's recall and understanding of the diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis. People may feel confused and perplexed when information about their illness is not communicated properly. Sharing information about diagnosis of a serious mental illness is particularly challenging. The nature of mental illness is often difficult to explain since there may be no clear aetiology, and the treatment options and prognosis may vary enormously. In addition, newly diagnosed psychiatric patients, who are actively ill, often may not accept their diagnosis due to lack of insight or stigma attached to the condition. There are several interventions that aim to help clinicians to communicate life changing medical diagnoses to people; however, little is known specifically for delivering a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy of different communication strategies used by clinicians to inform people about the diagnosis and outcome of schizophrenia compared with treatment as usual and to compare efficacy between different communication strategies. Search methods On 22 June 2015 and 29 June 2016, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials. We also searched sources of grey literature (e.g., dissertations, theses, clinical reports, evaluations published on websites, clinical guidelines and reports from regulatory agencies). Selection criteria We planned to include all relevant RCTs that included adults with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder. The trials would have investigated the effects of communication strategy or strategies that helped clinicians deliver information specifically about a diagnosis of schizophrenia (which can also include communication regarding the treatment options available and prognosis). Data collection and analysis Review authors independently examined all reports from the searches for any relevant studies. We planned to extract data independently. For binary outcomes, we would have calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we would have estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We would have employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We planned to assess risk of bias for included studies. We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 44 records which appeared to be relevant to the aims of the review. We obtained full reports for seven potential studies; however, after close inspection none of these studies met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Good communication of diagnosis can affect treatment planning, compliance and patient outcomes, especially in the case of conditions such as schizophrenia, which has the potential to cause serious life disruption for both people with schizophrenia and their carers. Currently, there is no evidence based on findings from RCTs assessing the effects of communication strategies for disclosing the diagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders. Research is required. Plain language summary Sharing information about the diagnosis and outcomes of schizophrenia: evidence from well‐designed clinical trials Background Health professionals have a duty to give information to their patients in a way that is understandable, especially when the condition is severe and life altering. Schizophrenia and similar related disorders are serious mental illnesses that can have long term, disruptive effects on the lives of both patients and their carers. The way a person is told they have a serious illness and what having this illness will mean for them can affect how they accept their diagnosis and treatment plans which then ultimately can affect their recovery and long‐term outlook. At the moment, there is no information or evidence regarding how best to disclose a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Searching for evidence In June 2015 and June 2016, we explored the medical literature and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register using appropriate keywords to find any studies which evaluated a method that guided or helped health professionals with how to deliver the news about the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We specifically searched for randomised controlled trials as these are considered the best way (gold standard) to evaluate the effects of treatments. We identified 44 publications and inspected these. From these, we obtained seven full reports of trials and that we thought could be relevant; however, none of these studies could be included in the review. Conclusions Currently health professionals can use good quality, evidence based information to guide them in the sharing of news about diagnosis of a serious physical illnesses; however, there is no such evidence available concerning the sharing of news about the diagnosis of schizophrenia. This is a serious gap in knowledge which needs attention and studies are needed in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background It is important to seek cost‐effective methods of improving the care and outcome of those with serious mental illnesses. User‐held records, where the person with the illness holds all or some personal information relating to the course and care of their illness, are now the norm in some clinical settings. Their value for those with severe mental illnesses is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the effects of personalised, accessible, user‐held clinical information for people with a severe mental illness (defined as psychotic illnesses). Search methods We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in August 2011. This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, and handsearches of journals and conference proceedings. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that:  i. have recruited adult participants with a diagnosis of a severe mental illness (specifically psychotic illnesses and severe mood disorders such as bipolar and depression with psychotic features); and  ii. compared any personalised and accessible clinical information held by the user beyond standard care to standard information routinely held such as appointment cards and generic information on diagnosis, treatment or services available. Data collection and analysis Study selection and data extraction were undertaken independently by two authors and confirmed and checked by a third. We contacted authors of trials for additional and missing data. Where possible, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results Four RCTs (n = 607) of user‐held records versus treatment as usual met the inclusion criteria. When the effect of user‐held records on psychiatric hospital admissions was compared with treatment as usual in four studies, the pooled treatment effect showed no significant impact of the intervention and was of very low magnitude (n = 597, 4 RCTs, RR 0.99 CI 0.71 to 1.38, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, there was no significant effect of the intervention in three studies which investigated compulsory psychiatric hospital admissions (n = 507, 4 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.37 to 1.10, moderate quality evidence). Other outcomes including satisfaction and mental state were investigated but pooled estimates were not obtainable due to skewed or poorly reported data, or only being investigated by one study. Two outcomes (violence and death) were not investigated by the included studies. Two important randomised studies are ongoing. Authors' conclusions The evidence gap remains regarding user‐held, personalised, accessible clinical information for people with psychotic illnesses for many of the outcomes of interest. However, based on moderate quality evidence, this review suggests that there is no effect of the intervention on hospital or outpatient appointment use for individuals with psychotic disorders. The number of studies is low, however, and further evidence is required to ascertain whether these results are mediated by the type of intervention, such as involvement of a clinical team or the type of information included. Plain language summary Patient‐held clinical information for people with psychotic illnesses User‐held information is where the ill person holds personal information about their care. Such records are becoming the norm in many settings and are becoming more popular with patients. This is especially the case where the person concerned is not in hospital and receives care from more than one professional. Providing people with information about their care is thought to increase their feelings of involvement in their treatment and aims to increase people’s satisfaction and participation with services, ensure early treatment and prevent hospital admission. The value of user‐held personal information for those with severe mental illnesses is not known however and research evaluating the effectiveness is rare. Some research suggests that while many people decline the offer of a user‐held record, the majority of those who carry their records report this to be useful. Based on a search in 2011, this review includes four trials with a total of 607 people and evaluates the effects of user‐held information for people with severe mental illness. In the main, the number of relevant studies is low, with poor reporting of some outcomes. Based on moderate quality evidence, the review found that user‐held information did not decrease hospital admissions, and did not decrease compulsory admissions or encourage people with severe mental illness to attend appointments (when compared to treatment as usual). Other important outcomes, such as satisfaction with care, costs and effect on mental health, were not available due to the limited quality of the four studies. There is therefore a gap in knowledge and evidence regarding user‐held information for people with severe mental health problems. Further evidence is also required on the different types of user‐held information (for example, if it involves the mental health team and what type of information is included in the record). Large‐scale, well‐conducted and well‐reported studies are required to assess the effects of user‐held information for people with mental illness. Two important randomised studies are currently taking place. For the present, despite a gap in evidence, user‐held information is low cost and acceptable to patients, so its use is likely to grow. However, it cannot be assumed that user‐held information is of benefit to people and is cost‐effective without further large‐scale, well‐conducted and well‐reported trials.

AB: Abstract - Background Caring for people with dementia is highly challenging, and family carers are recognised as being at increased risk of physical and mental ill‐health. Most current interventions have limited success in reducing stress among carers of people with dementia. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) draws on a range of practices and may be a promising approach to helping carers of people with dementia. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing the stress of family carers of people with dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 9 of 12, 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1950 to September 2017), Embase (Ovid SP 1974 to Sepetmber 2017), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science 1945 to September 2017), PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to September 2017), CINAHL (all dates to September 2017), LILACS (all dates to September 2017), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 6 September 2017, with no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MBSR for family carers of people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened references for inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information, then conducted meta‐analyses, or reported results narratively in the case of insufficient data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included five RCTs involving 201 carers assessing the effectiveness of MBSR. Controls used in included studies varied in structure and content. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction programmes were compared with either active controls (those matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. education, social support, or progressive muscle relaxation), or inactive controls (those not matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. self help education or respite care). One trial used both active and inactive comparisons with MBSR. All studies were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about selective reporting, incomplete outcome data, or allocation concealment. 1. Compared with active controls, MBSR may reduce depressive symptoms of carers at the end of the intervention (3 trials, 135 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.98 to ‐0.28; P<0.001; low‐quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low‐quality evidence). Mindfulness‐based stress reduction compared with active control may decrease carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 78 participants; mean difference (MD) ‐7.50, 95% CI ‐13.11 to ‐1.89; P<0.001; low‐quality evidence) and may slightly increase carer burden (3 trials, 135 participants; SMD 0.24, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.58; P=0.18; low‐quality evidence), although both results were imprecise, and we could not exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be sure of any effect on carers' coping style, nor could we determine whether carers were more or less likely to drop out of treatment. 2. Compared with inactive controls, MBSR showed no clear evidence of any effect on depressive symptoms (2 trials, 50 participants; MD ‐1.97, 95% CI ‐6.89 to 2.95; P=0.43; low‐quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low‐quality evidence). In this comparison, MBSR may also reduce carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 33 participants; MD ‐7.27, 95% CI ‐14.92 to 0.38; P=0.06; low‐quality evidence), although we were unable to exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be certain of any effects of MBSR on carer burden, the use of positive coping strategies, or dropout rates. We found no studies that looked at quality of life of carers or care‐recipients, or institutionalisation. Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting a single adverse event related to yoga practices at home Authors' conclusions After accounting for non‐specific effects of the intervention (i.e. comparing it with an active control), low‐quality evidence suggests that MBSR may reduce carers' depressive symptoms and anxiety, at least in the short term. There are significant limitations to the evidence base on MBSR in this population. Our GRADE assessment of the evidence was low to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily because of high risk of detection or performance bias, and imprecision. In conclusion, MBSR has the potential to meet some important needs of the carer, but more high‐quality studies in this field are needed to confirm its efficacy. Plain language summary Mindfulness‐based stress reduction for family carers of people with dementia Review question How effective is mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) in reducing stress‐related problems of family carers of people with dementia? Background Dementia has become a public health burden worldwide. Caring for people with dementia is highly stressful, thus carers are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, than general population. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction is a potentially promising intervention to target these issues. More information is needed about whether MBSR can help family carers of people with dementia. Study characteristics We searched for evidence up to September 2017 and found five randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing MBSR to a variety of other interventions. We reported the effects of MBSR programmes compared with active controls (interventions in which participants received a similar amount of attention to those in the MBSR group, such as social support or progressive muscle relaxation) or inactive controls (interventions in which participants received less attention than those in the MBSR group, such as self help education). Key results We were able to analyse study data from five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 201 carers. Findings from three studies (135 carers) showed that carers receiving MBSR may have a lower level of depressive symptoms at the end of treatment than those receiving an active control treatment. However, we found no clear evidence of any effect on depression when MBSR was compared with an inactive control treatment. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction may also lead to a reduction in carers' anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction may slightly increase carers' feelings of burden. However, the results on anxiety and burden were very uncertain. We were unable to draw conclusions about carers' coping strategies and the risk of dropping out of treatment due to the very low quality of the evidence. None of the studies measured quality of life of carers or people with dementia, or the rate of admission of people with dementia to care homes or hospitals. Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting one minor adverse event (neck strain in one participant practising yoga at home) Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, mainly because the studies were small and the way they were designed or conducted put them at risk of giving biased results. Consequently, we have limited confidence in the results. Conclusion To summarise, the review provides preliminary evidence on the effect of MBSR in treating some stress‐related problems of family carers of people with dementia. More good‐quality studies are needed before we can confirm whether or not MBSR is beneficial for family carers of people with dementia.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012122.pub2
AB: Abstract - Background In the 1940s reserpine, refined from a plant extract that had been used for centuries, began to be used as a treatment for people with mental disorders and was one of the very first antipsychotic drugs. Its irreversible pharmacological potency and adverse effects meant that it has been withdrawn in the UK and its role has been superceded by 'newer' compounds. The effects of reserpine are of historical interest although there are some reports of it still being used in highly specialist situations in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is also an old drug but it is still used for treatment of people with schizophrenia. Objectives To investigate the effects of two old medications (reserpine and chlorpromazine) for people with schizophrenia. Reserpine is now rarely used while chlorpromazine remains on the essential list of drugs of the World Health Organization (WHO). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (24 March 2016). Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia that presented useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The review currently includes nine studies with an average 60 participants per study. All of these studies are now over 60 years old, conducted between 1955 and 1962. When chlorpromazine was compared with reserpine for people with schizophrenia, improvement in global state was better at short term for those receiving chlorpromazine (n = 781, 6 RCTs, RR 'not improved' 0.75 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92,  low‐quality evidence ). Short‐term improvement in paranoid distortion was measured using the Multidimensional Scale for Rating Psychiatric Patients (MSRPP). Data showed no clear difference between treatment groups (n = 19, 1 RCT, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.62 to 2.89,  very low‐quality evidence ). There was no difference in functioning: occupational adjustment, medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and general behaviour (n = 98, 1 RCT, RR 0.79 CI 0.41 to 1.53,  moderate‐quality evidence ). Adverse events were poorly reported. For 'toxic reaction' there was, again, no obvious difference between the two compounds (n = 210, 3 RCTs, RR 1.68 95% CI 0.43 to 6.54,  moderate‐quality evidence ), and this also applied to leaving the study early (n = 229, 4 RCTs, RR 1.16 95% CI 0.94 to 1.42,  moderate‐quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Judged by standards of today, the evidence is largely of limited quality. However, some of these 1950s studies are remarkable in their foresight and clarity. Reserpine did have some effect on global state ‐ but chlorpromazine did seem to perform better. Important issues regarding adverse effects were not really addressed by these trials. Chlorpromazine remains on the WHO list of essential drugs. Reserpine is now almost obsolete, although, probably as a result of evidence other than that reported in the pioneering trials used in this review. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia Review question   Is there historical evidence that the very first antipsychotic drug (reserpine) ‐ which is now very rarely used ‐ is effective compared with an antipsychotic drug that has stayed in use for over 60 years (chlorpromazine). Background   Reserpine was discovered in the 1940s. It is a drug that stops some chemical functions in the brain for good so that even when the drug is stopped and out of a persons' system, the effect of the drug (good or bad) continues until the body replenishes its stores of the changed brain chemicals. This is not the case for chlorpromazine ‐ a drug that came along a little later ‐ the effect of which lasts only as long as the chemical is around in the body. Chlorpromazine's blockade of brain chemistry is reversible, reserpine's blockade is not. Study characteristics   The review currently includes nine studies with around 60 participants per study. All of these studies are now over 60 years old, conducted between 1955 and 1962 and include people with the most severe illnesses. Key results   Chlorpromazine does better than reserpine for 'improvement in global state' with most trials reporting on this outcome. There was no clear difference between the drugs for 'occupational adjustment', 'general behaviour', and, rather surprisingly, adverse events and finally, leaving the study early. Quality of the evidence Judged by standards of today, the evidence is largely of limited quality. However, some of these 1950s studies are remarkable in their foresight and clarity.

AB: Abstract - Background Zuclopenthixol is an older antipsychotic that has three distinct formulations (zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, zuclopenthixol acetate or Acuphase and zuclopenthixol decanoate). Although it has been in common use for many years no previous systematic review of its efficacy compared to placebo in schizophrenia has been undertaken. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of all formulations of zuclopenthixol when compared with a placebo in schizophrenia. Search methods On 6 November 2013 and 20 October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We also checked the references of all included studies and contacted authors of included studies for relevant studies and data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing zuclopenthixol of any form with placebo for treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted and cross‐checked data independently. We identified only a small number of studies so we cross checked all studies. We calculated fixed‐effect relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We analysed by intention‐to‐treat. Where possible we converted continuous outcomes into dichotomous outcomes. When this was not possible we used mean differences (MD) for continuous variables. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results Only two studies, with a total of 65 participants, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Overall the quality of the two studies was low, with small study populations and significant sources of bias, so we were not able to use all the data in our comparisons. . The studies were old from 1968 and 1972, and would be unlikely to pass modern peer review standard. We were only able to find short‐term data and only trials randomising zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. We also hoped to identify data for zuclopenthixol acetate versus placebo and zuclopenthixol decanoate versus placebo comparisons. We were unable to identify any studies that included data on these two fairly widely used drugs. For our primary outcome of interest, clinically significant improvement, we found one study that provided useable data. Global state measured by clinical global impression scale (CGI) improvement showed different ratings when assessed by a psychiatrist or a nurse.The psychiatrist scores failed to achieve statistical significance, however when assessed by nursing staff, the difference favouring zuclopenthixol did reach statistical significance (1 RCT n = 29, RR 2.57 95% CI 1.06 to 6.20, very low quality data). There was also evidence of increased sedation with those treated with zuclopenthixol when compared with placebo (1 RCT n = 29, RR 4.67 95% CI 1.23 to 17.68, very low quality data). 'Leaving the study early' data were equivocal. No useable data were available for outcomes such as relapse, mental state, death, quality of life, service use or economic costs. Authors' conclusions For people with schizophrenia this review shows that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride may help with the symptoms of schizophrenia. The review provides some trial evidence that, if taking zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, people may experience some adverse effects and sedation compared with placebo. However this evidence is of very low quality and with some significant sources of bias. There are no data for zuclopenthixol decanoate or zuclopenthixol acetate. For clinicians, the available trial data on the absolute effectiveness of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride do support its use but the limited nature of the data and significant sources of bias make conclusions hard to draw. Zuclopenthixol in all three forms is a commonly used antipsychotic and it is disappointing that there are so few data regarding its use. Plain language summary Zuclopenthixol versus placebo for people with schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Zuclopenthixol is an older antipsychotic drug, first introduced in 1962, that has three distinct formulations zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, zuclopenthixol acetate (or Acuphase), and zuclopenthixol decanoate. Although zuclopenthixol has been in common use for many years, no previous systematic review of its effectiveness compared to placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) in schizophrenia has been undertaken. Given the widespread use of this drug, it is important to look at the effectiveness of all three formulations of this commonly‐used drug so that health professionals, policy makers and people with schizophrenia can make better‐informed choices. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing zuclopenthixol with placebo in 2013. We found only two studies with 65 participants which could be included in this review. Overall the quality of these studies was low, with small numbers of people and significant bias. The studies were old, from 1968 and 1972, and would be unlikely to pass modern peer review standards. Only short‐term information and data could be found, and only about zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. The information is very limited but suggests that zuclopenthixol can lead to improvement in global state in comparison with placebo. However, there is also increased risk of side effects such as sedation,and tiredness. Given the low quality of information and age of the two studies, further research is needed, particularly further research on zuclopenthixol compared to newer and more recent antipsychotic drugs.

AB: Abstract - Background A huge gap exists between the production of evidence and its uptake in clinical practice settings. To fill this gap, treatment guidelines, based on explicit assessments of the evidence base, are commonly used in several fields of psychiatry, including schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. However, it remains unclear whether treatment guidelines have any material impact on provider performance and patient outcomes, and how implementation should be conducted to maximise benefit. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of guideline implementation strategies in improving process outcomes (performance of healthcare providers) and patient outcomes. We also explored which components of different guideline implementation strategies could influence them. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (March 2012 and August 2015), as well as references of included studies. Selection criteria Studies that examined schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders to compare guideline implementation strategies with usual care or to assess the comparative efficacy of different guideline implementation strategies. Data collection and analysis Review authors worked independently and in duplicate to critically appraise records from 990 studies; six individual studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the six included studies, significant heterogeneity was found in the focus of the guideline, target of the intervention, implementation strategy, and outcome measures, so meta‐analysis was carried out for antipsychotic co‐prescribing only. Main results This review now includes six studies, with a total of 1727 participants. Of the six included studies, practitioner impact was assessed in four. Overall, risk of bias was rated as low or unclear, and all evidence in the 'Summary of findings' tables was graded as low or very low quality .  Meta‐analysis revealed that a combination of several guideline dissemination and implementation strategies targeting healthcare professionals did not reduce antipsychotic co‐prescribing in schizophrenia outpatients (2 RCTs, N = 1082, RR 1.10 CI 0.99 to 1.23; corrected for cluster design: N = 310, RR 0.97, CI 0.75 to 1.25, very low‐quality evidence). One trial, which studied a nurse‐led intervention aimed at promoting cardiovascular disease screening, found a significant effect in the proportion of people receiving screening (Framingham score: N = 110, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.87), although in the analysis corrected for cluster design, the effect was no longer statistically significant (N = 38, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.03, very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported the patient outcomes of global state, satisfaction with care, treatment adherence, and drug attitude; no effect between treatments was seen. Quality of life was not reported by any of the studies. One trial, which studied the use of re‐written guideline text compared to original text, did not find a significant effect on staff receiving training (N = 68, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21, low‐quality evidence), staff receiving supervision (N = 68, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17, low‐quality evidence), or staff providing psychological interventions (N = 68, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.18, low‐quality evidence). Regarding participant outcomes, only one trial assessed the efficacy of a shared decision‐making implementation strategy and found no impact on psychopathology, satisfaction with care, or drug attitude. Another single trial studied a multifaceted intervention to promote medication adherence and found no effect on adherence rates. Authors' conclusions Considering the available evidence, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. The preliminary pattern of evidence suggests that uncertainty remains about clinically meaningful and sustainable effects of treatment guidelines on patient outcomes and how best to implement such guidelines for maximal benefit. Plain language summary Implementation of treatment guidelines in mental health care Background During the past few decades, a wide range of therapies and interventions for mental health have been developed that have been supported by evidence from research. This includes research evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments (such as antipsychotic drugs) and psychological therapies (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy and psychoeducation). However, research evidence is not easily translated into practice and the everyday working of healthcare services. A huge gap exists between the production of research evidence (what is known) and its uptake in healthcare settings (what is done). Better uptake of research evidence can be achieved by increasing awareness that such evidence exists. One method of encouraging better uptake is the use of treatment guidelines based on assessments of research evidence. Treatment guidelines are now commonly used in healthcare settings, including those providing treatment for schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear whether treatment guidelines have any positive impact on the performance of mental health services, or whether they improve outcomes for patients (such as better quality of life, improved mental state, employment, and fewer admissions to hospital). Searches This review is based on a search, carried out by the information specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, in March 2012 and updated in August 2015. Study characteristics    This review includes six studies that examine the effectiveness of guideline implementation strategies in improving healthcare services and outcomes for people with mental illness compared with the usual care provided. Results Although single studies provided initial evidence that implementation of treatment guidelines may achieve small changes in mental health practice, most results showed no effect. Conclusions    With such a small number of studies, and with all main results graded by review authors as providing very low‐quality evidence, it was not possible to arrive at concrete and definite conclusions. A gap in knowledge still exists about how implementation strategies might improve patient outcomes and health services. This leaves scant information for people with mental health problems, health professionals, and policy makers. More large‐scale, well‐designed and well‐conducted studies are necessary to fill this gap in knowledge.

AB: Abstract - Background Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury) is common in children and adolescents, often repeated, and strongly associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review on psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for deliberate SH first published in 1998 and previously updated in 1999. We have now divided the review into three separate reviews; this review is focused on psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for SH in children and adolescents. Objectives To identify all randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions, pharmacological agents, or natural products for SH in children and adolescents, and to conduct meta‐analyses (where possible) to compare the effects of specific treatments with comparison types of treatment (e.g., treatment as usual (TAU), placebo, or alternative pharmacological treatment) for children and adolescents who SH. Search methods For this update the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the CCDAN Specialised Register (30 January 2015). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial or pharmacological treatments with treatment as usual, alternative treatments, or placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment in children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised study quality, with consensus. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes measured using the same scale we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI; for those measured using different scales we calculated the standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. Meta‐analysis was only possible for two interventions: dialectical behaviour therapy for adolescents and group‐based psychotherapy. For these analyses, we pooled data using a random‐effects model. Main results We included 11 trials, with a total of 1,126 participants. The majority of participants were female (mean = 80.6% in 10 trials reporting gender). All trials were of psychosocial interventions; there were none of pharmacological treatments. With the exception of dialectical behaviour therapy for adolescents (DBT‐A) and group‐based therapy, assessments of specific interventions were based on single trials. We downgraded the quality of evidence owing to risk of bias or imprecision for many outcomes. Therapeutic assessment appeared to increase adherence with subsequent treatment compared with TAU (i.e., standard assessment; n = 70; k = 1; OR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.70 to 15.39), but this had no apparent impact on repetition of SH at either 12 (n = 69; k = 1; OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.06; GRADE: low quality) or 24 months (n = 69; k = 1; OR = 0.69, 05% CI 0.23 to 2.14; GRADE: low quality evidence). These results are based on a single cluster randomised trial, which may overestimate the effectiveness of the intervention. For patients with multiple episodes of SH or emerging personality problems, mentalisation therapy was associated with fewer adolescents scoring above the cut‐off for repetition of SH based on the Risk‐Taking and Self‐Harm Inventory 12 months post‐intervention (n = 71; k = 1; OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78; GRADE: moderate quality). DBT‐A was not associated with a reduction in the proportion of adolescents repeating SH when compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (n = 104; k = 2; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.40; GRADE: low quality). In the latter trial, however, the authors reported a significantly greater reduction over time in frequency of repeated SH in adolescents in the DBT condition, in whom there were also significantly greater reductions in depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. We found no significant treatment effects for group‐based therapy on repetition of SH for individuals with multiple episodes of SH at either the six (n = 430; k = 2; OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 5.24; GRADE: low quality) or 12 month (n = 490; k = 3; OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.97; GRADE: low quality) assessments, although considerable heterogeneity was associated with both (I 2  = 65% and 77% respectively). We also found no significant differences between the following treatments and TAU in terms of reduced repetition of SH: compliance enhancement (three month follow‐up assessment: n = 63; k = 1; OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.08; GRADE: very low quality), CBT‐based psychotherapy (six month follow‐up assessment: n = 39; k = 1; OR = 1.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 11.73; GRADE: very low quality), home‐based family intervention (six month follow‐up assessment: n = 149; k = 1; OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.51; GRADE: low quality), and provision of an emergency card (12 month follow‐up assessment: n = 105, k = 1; OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.04; GRADE: very low quality). No data on adverse effects, other than the planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were reported. Authors' conclusions There are relatively few trials of interventions for children and adolescents who have engaged in SH, and only single trials contributed to all but two comparisons in this review. The quality of evidence according to GRADE criteria was mostly very low. There is little support for the effectiveness of group‐based psychotherapy for adolescents with multiple episodes of SH based on the results of three trials, the evidence from which was of very low quality according to GRADE criteria. Results for therapeutic assessment, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy indicated that these approaches warrant further evaluation. Despite the scale of the problem of SH in children and adolescents there is a paucity of evidence of effective interventions. Further large‐scale trials, with a range of outcome measures including adverse events, and investigation of therapeutic mechanisms underpinning these interventions, are required. It is increasingly apparent that development of new interventions should be done in collaboration with patients to ensure that these are likely to meet their needs. Use of an agreed set of outcome measures would assist evaluation and both comparison and meta‐analysis of trials. Plain language summary Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm Why is this review important? Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in children and adolescents in many countries and is strongly linked to risk of future suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Who will be interested in this review? Clinicians working with young people who engage in SH, policy makers, young people who themselves have self‐harmed or may be at risk of doing so, and their families and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH aimed specifically at children and adolescents. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes, particularly with regards to investigating whether there are specific treatments for children and adolescents who SH which have greater benefit compared to routine care in terms of treatment adherence and improvements in psychological well‐being. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or pharmacological treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH and presented to clinical services. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. Providing therapeutic assessment may improve attendance at subsequent treatment sessions. Only one therapeutic approach ‐ mentalisation ‐ was associated with a reduction in frequency of repetition of SH. However this effect was only modest and the trial was small, which prevents us from being able to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this treatment. There was no clear evidence of effectiveness for compliance enhancement, individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, home‐based family intervention, or provision of an emergency card, nor was there clear evidence for group therapy for adolescents with a history of multiple episodes of SH. What should happen next? Therapeutic assessment, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation. While in a single small study, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy appeared ineffective, further evaluation of this treatment is also desirable given the favourable results found in adults who SH. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is a debilitating condition affecting more than 350 million people worldwide ( WHO 2012 ) with a limited number of evidence‐based treatments. Drug treatments may be inappropriate due to side effects and cost, and not everyone can use talking therapies.There is a need for evidence‐based treatments that can be applied across cultures and with people who find it difficult to verbally articulate thoughts and feelings. Dance movement therapy (DMT) is used with people from a range of cultural and intellectual backgrounds, but effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To examine the effects of DMT for depression with or without standard care, compared to no treatment or standard care alone, psychological therapies, drug treatment, or other physical interventions. Also, to compare the effectiveness of different DMT approaches. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) and CINAHL were searched (to 2 Oct 2014) together with the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and  ClinicalTrials.gov . The review authors also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Dissertation Abstracts (to August 2013), handsearched bibliographies, contacted professional associations, educational programmes and dance therapy experts worldwide. Selection criteria Inclusion criteria were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying outcomes for people of any age with depression as defined by the trialist, with at least one group being DMT. DMT was defined as: participatory dance movement with clear psychotherapeutic intent, facilitated by an individual with a level of training that could be reasonably expected within the country in which the trial was conducted. For example, in the USA this would either be a trainee, or qualified and credentialed by the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). In the UK, the therapist would either be in training with, or accredited by, the Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy (ADMP, UK). Similar professional bodies exist in Europe, but in some countries (e.g. China) where the profession is in development, a lower level of qualification would mirror the situation some decades previously in the USA or UK. Hence, the review authors accepted a relevant professional qualification (e.g. nursing or psychodynamic therapies) plus a clear description of the treatment that would indicate its adherence to published guidelines including  Levy 1992 ,  ADMP UK 2015 ,  Meekums 2002 , and  Karkou 2006 . Data collection and analysis Study methodological quality was evaluated and data were extracted independently by the first two review authors using a data extraction form, the third author acting as an arbitrator. Main results Three studies totalling 147 participants (107 adults and 40 adolescents) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy‐four participants took part in DMT treatment, while 73 comprised the control groups. Two studies included male and female adults with depression. One of these studies included outpatient participants; the other study was conducted with inpatients at an urban hospital. The third study reported findings with female adolescents in a middle‐school setting. All included studies collected continuous data using two different depression measures: the clinician‐completed Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D); and the Symptom Checklist‐90‐R (SCL‐90‐R) (self‐rating scale). Statistical heterogeneity was identified between the three studies. There was no reliable effect of DMT on depression (SMD ‐0.67 95% CI ‐1.40 to 0.05; very low quality evidence). A planned subgroup analysis indicated a positive effect in adults, across two studies, 107 participants, but this failed to meet clinical significance (SMD ‐7.33 95% CI ‐9.92 to ‐4.73). One adult study reported drop‐out rates, found to be non‐significant with an odds ratio of 1.82 [95% CI 0.35 to 9.45]; low quality evidence. One study measured social functioning, demonstrating a large positive effect (MD ‐6.80 95 % CI ‐11.44 to ‐2.16; very low quality evidence), but this result was imprecise. One study showed no effect in either direction for quality of life (0.30 95% CI ‐0.60 to 1.20; low quality evidence) or self esteem (1.70 95% CI ‐2.36 to 5.76; low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The low‐quality evidence from three small trials with 147 participants does not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of DMT for depression. Larger trials of high methodological quality are needed to assess DMT for depression, with economic analyses and acceptability measures and for all age groups. Plain language summary Is dance movement therapy an effective treatment for depression? A review of the evidence Why is this review important? Depression affects 350 million people worldwide, impacting on quality of life, work, relationships and physical health. Medication and talking therapies are not always suitable or available. Dance movement therapy (DMT) uses bodily movements to explore and express emotions with groups or individuals. This is the first review of the effectiveness of DMT for depression and will add to the evidence base regarding depression treatments. Who might be interested in this review? People affected by depression. General practitioners. Mental health professionals. Psychological therapists. What questions does this review aim to answer? Is DMT more effective than no treatment or standard care? Is DMT more effective than talking therapies? Is DMT more effective than medication? Is DMT more effective than physical treatments such as dance or exercise? How effective are different types of DMT? Which studies were included in the review? Databases were searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of DMT for depression up to October 2014, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity. Three studies (147 participants) met inclusion criteria: two of adults (men and women); and one of adolescents (females only). What does the evidence from the review tell us? Due to the low number of studies and low quality of evidence, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of DMT for depression. It was not possible to compare DMT with medication, talking therapies, physical treatments or to compare types of DMT due to lack of available evidence. Key findings were: Overall, there is no evidence for or against DMT as a treatment for depression. There is some evidence to suggest DMT is more effective than standard care for adults, but this was not clinically significant. DMT is no more effective than standard care for young people. Evidence from just one study of low methodological quality suggested that drop‐out rates from the DMT group were not significant, and there is no reliable effect in either direction for quality of life or self esteem. A large positive effect was observed for social functioning, but since this was from one study of low methodological quality the result is imprecise. What should happen next? Future studies should be of high methodological quality, comparing DMT with other treatments for depression, and include economic analyses.

AB: Abstract - Background Functional analysis (FA) for the management of challenging behaviour is a promising behavioural intervention that involves exploring the meaning or purpose of an individual’s behaviour. It extends the ‘ABC’ approach of behavioural analysis, to overcome the restriction of having to derive a single explanatory hypothesis for the person’s behaviour. It is seen as a first line alternative to traditional pharmacological management for agitation and aggression. FA typically requires the therapist to develop and evaluate hypotheses‐driven strategies that aid family and staff caregivers to reduce or resolve a person’s distress and its associated behavioural manifestations. Objectives To assess the effects of functional analysis‐based interventions for people with dementia (and their caregivers) living in their own home or in other settings. Search methods We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 3 March 2011 using the terms: FA, behaviour (intervention, management, modification), BPSD, psychosocial and Dementia. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with reported behavioural outcomes that could be associated with functional analysis for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia. Data collection and analysis Four reviewers selected trials for inclusion. Two reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess trial quality, including bias. Meta‐analyses for reported incidence, frequency, severity of care recipient challenging behaviour and mood (primary outcomes) and caregiver reaction, burden and mood were performed. Details of adverse effects were noted. Main results Eighteen trials are included in the review. The majority were in family care settings. For fourteen studies, FA was just one aspect of a broad multi‐component programme of care. Assessing the effect of FA was compromised by ill‐defined protocols for the duration of component parts of these programmes (i.e. frequency of the intervention or actual time spent). Therefore, establishing the real effect of the FA component was not possible. Overall, positive effects were noted at post‐intervention for the frequency of reported challenging behaviour (but not for incidence or severity) and for caregiver reaction (but not burden or depression). These effects were not seen at follow‐up. Authors' conclusions The delivery of FA has been incorporated within wide ranging multi‐component programmes and study designs have varied according to setting ‐ i.e. family care, care homes and hospital, with surprisingly few studies located in care homes. Our findings suggest potential beneficial effects of multi‐component interventions, which utilise FA. Whilst functional analysis for challenging behaviour in dementia care shows promise, it is too early to draw conclusions about its efficacy. Plain language summary Inconclusive, but promising evidence for the efficacy of functional analysis interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia The management of challenging behaviour, such as aggression and agitation in dementia has been dominated by drug therapies such as the antipsychotics, despite their modest efficacy, side effects and potential detriment to quality of life. Functional analysis (FA) is a behavioural intervention that is described by international guidelines as the first line alternative to drug therapy for challenging behaviour. FA typically requires the therapist to develop an understanding of the function or meaning behind the person’s distressed behaviour. It uses this understanding to develop individually tailored strategies aimed at both the person with dementia and the caregivers, to relieve the distress caused by the behaviour. FA can be applied in home settings where the family or informal caregiver is offered support from a therapist, or in care homes, hospitals or assisted living settings, where training in FA and specialist support to deliver interventions is provided for staff.  In this review we analysed the effectiveness of functional analysis‐based interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia. We found eighteen randomised controlled trials suitable for analysis in all four types of care settings. The majority were in family care settings and there were surprisingly few care home based studies. Most evaluated broad programmes of care, where FA was just one component of a wide range of other interventions. This made it hard to determine the real effect of FA for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia.  However, positive results were noted in the frequency of the person’s reported problem behaviours and the caregiver’s reaction to them. No significant effects were found for incidence or severity of mood and other problem behaviours. Similarly, no significant effects were found for caregiver mood or burden. Whilst it is too early to reach a firm conclusion on the evidence for FA in the management of challenging behaviour in dementia, we note emerging beneficial effects on challenging behaviour where multi‐component psychosocial interventions have used FA as part of the programme of care.

AB: Abstract - Background Collaborative care for severe mental illness (SMI) is a community‐based intervention, which typically consists of a number of components. The intervention aims to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care for people with SMI who are living in the community. The primary outcome of interest was psychiatric admissions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised register in April 2011. The register is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also contacted 51 experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) described as collaborative care by the trialists comparing any form of collaborative care with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI, defined as schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis (e.g. schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders), bipolar affective disorder or other types of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently to extract and quality assess data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed. Main results We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review. We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia. The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care. All results are ' low or very low quality evidence'. Data indicated that collaborative care reduced psychiatric admissions at year two in comparison to standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). The sensitivity analysis showed that the proportion of participants psychiatrically hospitalised was lower in the intervention group than the standard care group in year three: 28% compared to 38% (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99). In comparison to the standard care group, collaborative care significantly improved the Mental Health Component (MHC) of quality of life at the three‐year follow‐up, (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 3.50, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.20). The Physical Health Component (PHC) of the quality of life measure at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.91). Direct intervention (all‐treatment) costs of collaborative care at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly from standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD ‐$2981.00, 95% CI $16934.93 to $10972.93). The proportion of participants leaving the study early did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.79). There is no trial‐based information regarding the effect of collaborative care for people with schizophrenia. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of deaths by suicide at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32), or the number of participants that died from all other causes at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.66). Authors' conclusions The review did not identify any studies relevant to care of people with schizophrenia and hence there is no evidence available to determine if collaborative care is effective for people suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders. There was however one trial at high risk of bias that suggests that collaborative care for US veterans with bipolar disorder may reduce psychiatric admissions at two years and improves quality of life (mental health component) at three years, however, on its own it is not sufficient for us to make any recommendations regarding its effectiveness. More large, well designed, conducted and reported trials are required before any clinical or policy making decisions can be made. Plain language summary Collaborative care approaches for people with severe mental illness Collaborative care aims to improve the physical and mental health of people with severe mental illness (SMI). Common to all definitions is that collaborative care aims to develop closer working relationships between primary care (family doctors or GPs and practice nurses) and specialist health care (such as Community Mental Health Teams). There are different ways in which this can be achieved, making collaborative care very complex. Integrating or joining‐up primary care and mental health services, so that they work better together, is intended to increase communication and joint working between health professionals (e.g. GPs, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists). This is meant to provide a person with severe mental illness with better care, based in the community, which is often a less stigmatised setting than hospital, and that promotion of good practice helps consumers maintain contact with services. A major issue is that many GPs still feel that physical health problems (such as diabetes, heart disease, smoking cessation) are more their concern and see treatment of severe mental illness as the job of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Collaborative care aims to improve overall quality of care by ensuring that healthcare professionals work together, trying to meet the physical and mental health needs of people. The aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in comparison to standard or usual care. An electronic search for trials was carried out in April 2011. The primary focus of interest was admissions to hospital. According to the one included study in this review, collaborative care may be effective in reducing going into hospital (less psychiatric admissions and other admissions). It also helps improve people’s quality of life and mental health. However, all evidence was either low or very low quality and further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with SMI in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better as well as its cost effectiveness. This summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray (Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness).

AB: Abstract - Background Morita therapy was founded in 1919 by Shoma Morita (1874‐1938). The therapy involves a behavioural structured program to encourage an outward perspective on life and increased social functioning. Objectives To evaluate the effects of Morita therapy for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register, the Chongqing VIP Database, and the Wanfang Database (July 2008) for all relevant references. The first author of each included study was also contacted. We updated this search (July 2012) and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials comparing Morita therapy with any other treatment. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies and extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random‐effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We found 12 small, studies of medium‐poor quality (total n=1123). The standard care versus Morita therapy comparison (total n=761 people) had very low attrition (<2%, 10 RCTs, RR 1.01 CI 0.4 to 2.8). Mental state did tend to improve with Morita therapy (n=76, 1 RCT, number of >25‐30% decline in BPRS, RR 0.36 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 5 CI 4 to 25). For negative symptoms data were inconsistent, with data from four short‐term trials favouring Morita therapy (n=323, WMD average endpoint SANS ‐12.94 CI ‐21.6 to ‐4.3), but heterogeneity was considerable (I 2  =97%). In medium‐term studies, negative symptoms were favoured by Morita therapy (n=44, 1 RCT, RR >25% decline SANS 0.25 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 8). Morita therapy plus standard treatment did significantly improve the activities of daily living compared with standard treatment alone (n=104, 1 RCT, WMD ‐4.1 average endpoint ADL CI ‐7.7 to ‐0.6). Compared with a rehabilitation programme Morita therapy did not promote attrition (n=302, 2 RCTs, RR leaving early 1.00 CI 0.5 to 2.1). In two very similar studies Morita therapy showed better effect on mental state with lower BPRS score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint BPRS ‐6.95 CI ‐9.3 to ‐4.6, I 2  =0%), insight score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint clinical judgement score ‐1.11 CI ‐1.3 to ‐0.9, I 2  = 0%) and social functioning (n=278, WMD average endpoint IPROS ‐18.14 CI ‐21.3 to ‐15.0, I 2  =0%). Authors' conclusions Morita therapy for schizophrenia remains an experimental intervention. New trials are justified and specific plans for the design of future studies are outlined. [Note: the 10 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.] Plain language summary Morita therapy for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a long‐term, chronic illness with a high disability rate and disease burden. Treatment for schizophrenia should focus on the wider social aspects of living in the community in addition to medicating the immediate symptoms of this long‐term illness. Reliance on medication alone is insufficient, especially for patients with an illness which is often very debilitating. There are several kinds of intervention strategies available, often involving both the individual sufferer and the wider family unit; Morita therapy being one of these. Morita therapy is a systematic psychotherapy based on Eastern psychology. The aim of this type of therapy is to alleviate the anxiety of sufferers and eliminate neurotic symptoms by encouraging the patient to accept anxiety as a natural state, whilst at the same time engaging them in constructive behaviours via four phases. To date the efficacy of Morita therapy for schizophrenia has not been verified systematically. In this review we analysed the effects of Morita therapy in hospital settings for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like conditions. We were only able to include 12 studies, which varied in terms of the number of treatment phases used, and duration of treatment. Six studies were not blinded and four were inadequately randomised. Results indicate Morita therapy may have some early positive effects, but there is no data to assess whether this can be sustained in the long term. This review highlights the need for better‐designed studies to assess the efficacy of this therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Epidemiological evidence shows a relationship between cognitive impairment and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The risk of dementia increases with duration of disease. This updated systematic review investigated the effect on cognitive function of the type of treatment and level of metabolic control in people with Type 2 diabetes. Objectives To assess the effects of different strategies for managing Type 2 diabetes mellitus on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG)), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS on 15 October 2016. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases, (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many trials' registers and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared two or more different treatments for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and in which cognitive function was measured at baseline and after treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the included RCTs. We pooled data for comparable trials and estimated the effects of treatment by using risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), according to the nature of the outcome. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We identified seven eligible studies but only four provided data we could include in efficacy analyses. Two of these studies compared intensive versus standard glycaemic control and two compared different pharmacological treatments. All studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least two domains and one large study was at high risk of performance and detection bias. (a) Two studies with 13,934 participants at high cardiovascular risk provided efficacy data on intensive versus standard glycaemic control. A third study with 1791 participants provided additional data on hypoglycaemic episodes and mortality. There is probably no difference between treatment groups in the number of participants who decline by at least 3 points on the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) over five years (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08; 1 study; n = 11,140; moderate‐quality evidence); and there may also be little or no difference in the incidence of dementia (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.85; 1 study; n = 11,140; low‐quality evidence). From another study, there was probably little or no difference in MMSE score after 40 months (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.16; 1 study; n = 2794; moderate quality evidence). Participants exposed to the intensive glycaemic control strategy probably experience more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia than those who have standard treatment (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.14; 2 studies; n = 12,827; moderate‐quality evidence). The evidence from these trials suggests that the intensity of glycaemic control may have little or no effect on all‐cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.13; 3 studies; n = 15,888; low‐quality evidence). (b) One study with 156 participants compared glibenclamide (glyburide) with repaglinide. There may be a small advantage of glibenclamide on global cognitive function measured with the MMSE after 12 months (MD −0.90, 95% CI −1.68 to −0.12; low‐quality evidence). No data were reported on the incidence of dementia, hypoglycaemic events or all‐cause mortality. (c) One study with 145 participants compared rosiglitazone plus metformin to glibenclamide (glyburide) plus metformin over 24 weeks. It reported only on cognitive subdomains and not on global cognitive function, incidence of MCI or dementia, hypoglycaemic events or all causes of mortality. Authors' conclusions We found no good evidence that any specific treatment or treatment strategy for Type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay cognitive impairment. The best available evidence related to the comparison of intensive with standard glycaemic control strategies. Here there was moderate‐quality evidence that the strategies do not differ in their effect on global cognitive functioning over 40 to 60 months. Plain language summary Effect of the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus on the development of cognitive impairment and dementia Background Dementia is a global healthcare concern. Type 2 diabetes mellitus — a form of diabetes which becomes commoner with older age — increases the risk of developing dementia. Type 1 diabetes, which typically begins earlier in life, is always treated with insulin; but there are a variety of different ways of treating Type 2 diabetes, including lifestyle changes and different medications. We wanted to find out if some ways of treating Type 2 diabetes were better than others in terms of preventing either dementia or less serious decline in cognition (memory and other thinking skills). What we did We searched medical databases for clinical trials in which participants had been assigned at random to different treatments for Type 2 diabetes and in which cognition had been measured at the beginning and end of the trial. We were only interested in treatments for Type 2 diabetes which are recommended by international clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We analysed data from the studies we found, looking for effects on dementia and cognition, death rates and the side effect of hypoglycaemia, which is when blood glucose levels fall too low and which can be a result of treatment. Key results We found seven randomised trials suitable for inclusion in this review, but we could only get data on cognition from four of them. Of these, the two larger studies had a total of 13,934 participants and compared a standard treatment strategy with a more intensive strategy which aimed to keep blood glucose lower. Two smaller studies, which each had approximately 150 participants, compared different drug treatments, but in both studies one of the treatments was a drug which is not generally considered suitable for older patients. We found no good evidence that any of the treatments in these studies was clearly superior to any other for preventing dementia or cognitive decline. An intensive treatment strategy was more likely than standard treatment to cause hypoglycaemia, but there were no differences in death rates. Quality of evidence We judged the quality of the evidence for all outcomes to be low or moderate due to risk of bias in the included studies, small sample sizes, and imprecise estimates of the effects. This means that our confidence in the results is limited.

AB: Abstract - Background The number of people living with dementia is increasing rapidly. Clinical dementia does not develop suddenly, but rather is preceded by a period of cognitive decline beyond normal age‐related change. People at this intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and clinical dementia are often described as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Considerable research and clinical efforts have been directed toward finding disease‐modifying interventions that may prevent or delay progression from MCI to clinical dementia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of at least 12 weeks of computerised cognitive training (CCT) on maintaining or improving cognitive function and preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched to 31 May 2018 in ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ) and ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO portal/ICTRP ( www.apps.who.int/trialsearch ) to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in which cognitive training via interactive computerised technology was compared with an active or inactive control intervention. Experimental computerised cognitive training (CCT) interventions had to adhere to the following criteria: minimum intervention duration of 12 weeks; any form of interactive computerised cognitive training, including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality. Participants were adults with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), or otherwise at high risk of cognitive decline. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included RCTs. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to describe the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results Eight RCTs with a total of 660 participants met review inclusion criteria. Duration of the included trials varied from 12 weeks to 18 months. Only one trial used an inactive control. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in several domains. Overall, our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by very low‐quality evidence. Almost all results were very imprecise; there were also problems related to risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and indirectness of the evidence. No trial provided data on incident dementia. For comparisons of CCT with both active and inactive controls, the quality of evidence on our other primary outcome of global cognitive function immediately after the intervention period was very low. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about this outcome. Due to very low quality of evidence, we were also unable to determine whether there was any effect of CCT compared to active control on our secondary outcomes of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, depression, functional performance, and mortality. We found low‐quality evidence suggesting that there is probably no effect on speed of processing (SMD 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies; 119 participants), verbal fluency (SMD ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.76 to 0.44; 3 studies; 150 participants), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI ‐1.85 to 2.65; 1 study; 19 participants). When CCT was compared with inactive control, we obtained data on five secondary outcomes, including episodic memory, executive function, verbal fluency, depression, and functional performance. We found very low‐quality evidence; therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about these outcomes. Authors' conclusions Currently available evidence does not allow us to determine whether or not computerised cognitive training will prevent clinical dementia or improve or maintain cognitive function in those who already have evidence of cognitive impairment. Small numbers of trials, small samples, risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and highly imprecise results mean that it is not possible to derive any implications for clinical practice, despite some observed large effect sizes from individual studies. Direct adverse events are unlikely to occur, although the time and sometimes the money involved in computerised cognitive training programmes may represent significant burdens. Further research is necessary and should concentrate on improving methodological rigour, selecting suitable outcomes measures, and assessing generalisability and persistence of any effects. Trials with long‐term follow‐up are needed to determine the potential of this intervention to reduce the risk of dementia. Plain language summary Computerised cognitive training for preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment Background The terms 'cognition' and 'cognitive function' describe all of the mental activities related to thinking, learning, remembering, and communicating. There are normal changes in cognition with age, There are also diseases that affect cognition, principally dementia, in which cognition is impaired to the point of affecting a person's ability to manage daily activities. More common than dementia is a condition often described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in which mild impairment of cognition, more than expected from age alone, can be detected on testing, but by which daily functioning is largely unaffected. For some people, MCI is a stage on the way to developing dementia. There is a lot of interest in anything that might prevent further decline in cognition in people with MCI. One thing that has been suggested as a means of doing this is computerised cognitive training (CCT). Cognitive training consists of a set of standardised tasks intended to 'exercise the brain' in various ways. These days, cognitive training exercises are often delivered via computers or mobile technology, so that people can do them on their own at home. We wanted to know whether CCT is an effective way for people with MCI to maintain their cognitive function and reduce their risk of going on to develop dementia. What we did We searched the medical literature up to 15 March 2018 for trials in which a group of people with MCI had participated in CCT for at least 12 weeks and had been compared with another group that had not received any CCT. This 'control' group could have taken part in an alternative activity instead, or group members could have received no intervention at all. For the comparison to be as fair as possible, it should have been decided at random whether people were in the CCT or control group. We were primarily interested in whether study participants developed dementia and in their overall cognitive function, but we also looked for evidence on particular cognitive skills, daily activities, quality of life, mood, or mental well‐being, and any harmful effects. What we found We found eight trials with 660 participants to include in the review. Seven of the trials (623 participants) compared CCT to an alternative activity. None of the included trials examined development of dementia, so this review presents no evidence on whether taking part in computerised cognitive training will help to prevent dementia. Our main finding in relation to all of the other outcomes in which we were interested was that the overall quality of the evidence was very low. This very low quality was mainly due to small sample sizes, problems with study methods, and differences between trials. Therefore, although we found some evidence for a few benefits of CCT for cognition, we were highly uncertain about study results and consider it likely that future research might lead to different results. Our conclusions Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to answer our review question with any certainty. We think it remains an important area for further study. We would like to see larger studies, which would be more able to detect effects of CCT, and longer studies, which are needed to show whether there are any benefits, whether benefits are long‐lasting, and whether there is a chance of preventing or delaying the development of dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Antidepressants are taken by approximately 30% of people with IBD. However, there are no current guidelines on treating co‐morbid anxiety and depression in people with IBD with antidepressants, nor are there clear data on the role of antidepressants in managing physical symptoms of IBD. Objectives The objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for treating anxiety and depression in IBD, and to assess the effects of antidepressants on quality of life (QoL) and managing disease activity in IBD. Search methods We searched MEDLINE; Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 23 August 2018. Reference lists, trials registers, conference proceedings and grey literature were also searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing any type of antidepressant to placebo, no treatment or an active therapy for IBD were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We used the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale to assess quality of observational studies. GRADE was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes. Primary outcomes included anxiety and depression. Anxiety was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) or the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Depression was assessed using HADS or the Beck Depression Inventory. Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, withdrawal due to AEs, quality of life (QoL), clinical remission, relapse, pain, hospital admissions, surgery, and need for steroid treatment. QoL was assessed using the WHO‐QOL‐BREF questionnaire. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. A fixed‐effect model was used for analysis. Main results We included four studies (188 participants). Two studies were double‐blind RCTs, one was a non‐randomised controlled trial, and one was an observational retrospective case‐matched study. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had quiescent IBD and in one study participants had active or quiescent IBD. Participants in one study had co‐morbid anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants in clinical ranges. Three studies had placebo controls and one study had a no treatment control group. One RCT was rated as low risk of bias and the other was rated as high risk of bias (incomplete outcome data). The non‐randomised controlled trial was rated as high risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding). The observational study was rated as high methodological quality, but is still considered to be at high risk of bias given its observational design. The effect of antidepressants on anxiety and depression is uncertain. At 12 weeks, the mean anxiety score in antidepressant participants was 6.11  +  3 compared to 8.5  +  3.45 in placebo participants (MD ‐2.39, 95% ‐4.30 to ‐0.48, 44 participants, low certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean anxiety score in antidepressant participants was 3.8  +  2.5 compared to 4.2  +  4.9 in placebo participants (MD ‐0.40, 95% ‐3.47 to 2.67, 26 participants; low certainty evidence). At 12 weeks, the mean depression score in antidepressant participants was 7.47  +  2.42 compared to 10.5  +  3.57 in placebo participants (MD ‐3.03, 95% CI ‐4.83 to ‐1.23, 44 participants; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean depression score in antidepressant participants was 2.9  +  2.8 compared to 3.1  +  3.4 in placebo participants (MD ‐0.20, 95% ‐2.62 to 2.22, 26 participants; low certainty evidence). The effect of antidepressants on AEs is uncertain. Fifty‐seven per cent (8/14) of antidepressant participants group reported AEs versus 25% (3/12) of placebo participants (RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.78 to 6.73, low certainty evidence). Commonly reported AEs include nausea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual problems, insomnia, fatigue, low mood/anxiety, dry mouth, muscle spasms and hot flushes. None of the included studies reported any serious AEs. None of the included studies reported on pain. One study (44 participants) reported on QoL at 12 weeks and another study (26 participants) reported on QoL at 12 months. Physical, Psychological, Social and Environmental QoL were improved at 12 weeks compared to placebo (all low certainty evidence). There were no group differences in QoL at 12 months (all low certainty evidence). The effect of antidepressants on maintenance of clinical remission and endoscopic relapse is uncertain. At 12 months, 64% (9/14) of participants in the antidepressant group maintained clinical remission compared to 67% (8/12) of placebo participants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.69; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, none (0/30) of participants in the antidepressant group had endoscopic relapse compared to 10% (3/30) of placebo participants (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.65; very low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in IBD can be drawn. Future studies should employ RCT designs, with a longer follow‐up and develop solutions to address attrition. Inclusion of objective markers of disease activity is strongly recommended as is testing antidepressants from different classes, as at present it is unclear if any antidepressant (or class thereof) has differential efficacy. Plain language summary Antidepressants for inflammatory bowel disease What is inflammatory bowel disease? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract (colon or small intestine or both). IBD predominantly comprises Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Symptoms of IBD include diarrhoea, urgency of defecation (including faecal incontinence), abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fatigue and weight loss. When people experience symptoms of IBD they are considered to have active disease. When symptoms of IBD stop the disease is in remission. IBD is associated with a psycho‐social burden, with rates of depression in people with IBD twice as high as in the general population. Anxiety and depression which accompany IBD may be associated with poor quality of life, worsening IBD activity, higher hospitalisation rates and lower adherence to treatment. Up to 30% of people living with IBD take antidepressants which are prescribed for either mental health or bowel symptoms or both. What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are drugs used to treat depression and other mental disorders such as anxiety. No antidepressants are currently approved by regulatory agencies for specifically treating anxiety and depression, to manage physical symptoms or to reduce bowel inflammation in people with IBD. However, some antidepressants have indications for treatment of pain in chronic conditions and have been commonly used to manage functional bowel symptoms in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. What did the researchers investigate? Previously conducted studies of antidepressant therapy in IBD were reviewed. The data from some of these studies were combined using a method called a meta‐analysis. During the analysis, people who took antidepressants were compared with those who did not take antidepressants with regard to rates of anxiety and depression and also other measures such as quality of life, side effects and IBD disease activity. What did the researchers find? The researchers searched the medical literature up to 23 August 2018. Four published studies, including a total of 188 people, examined antidepressant therapy in people with IBD. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had IBD in remission and in one study participants had either active IBD or IBD in remission. Participants in one study had co‐existing anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants. Three studies had a placebo (e.g. sugar pill) control group and one study had a no treatment control group. The analysis showed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression were improved in those who took antidepressants compared to placebo. Participants who received antidepressants experienced more side effects than those who received placebo. Side effects reported by those taking antidepressants included: nausea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual problems, insomnia, fatigue, low mood/anxiety, dry mouth, poor sleep, restless legs and hot flushes. Some aspects of quality of life were improved as was IBD activity in the antidepressant group. The overall quality of the studies included in this review was poor because the studies included small numbers of participants, and involved IBD populations which differed from each other on key characteristics. In addition, different types of antidepressants were assessed so the evidence for any one antidepressant was uncertain. Therefore, future studies are needed to confirm these observations. Conclusion The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of antidepressants in IBD can be drawn. More studies are needed to allow for firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of the use of antidepressants in people with IBD.

AB: Abstract - Background Propentofylline is a novel therapeutic agent for dementia that readily crosses the blood‐brain barrier and acts by blocking the uptake of adenosine and inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase. In vitro and in vivo its mechanism of action appears to be twofold; it inhibits the production of free radicals and reduces the activation of microglial cells. It therefore interacts with the inflammatory processes that are thought to contribute to dementia, and given its mechanism of action is a possible disease modifying agent rather than a purely symptomatic treatment. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of propentofylline for people with dementia. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library,  MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 10 January 2008 using the terms: propentofylline OR hextol OR karsivan. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Aventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, was asked for data from unpublished studies but declined to enter into correspondence. Selection criteria Unconfounded double‐blind randomized controlled trials of propentofylline compared with a placebo or another treatment group. Data collection and analysis There were detailed reports of only four of the nine included studies. The efficacy of propentofylline was reviewed for undifferentiated dementia as there were not enough data to attempt a subgroup analysis for the types of dementia. Main results The following statistically significant treatment effects in favour of propentofylline are reported.   Cognition at 3, 6 and 12 months including MMSE at 12 months. [MD 1.2, 95%CI 0.12 to 2.28, P=0.03]   Severity of dementia at 3, 6 and 12 months including CGI at 12 months [MD ‐0.21, 95%CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.03, P=0.03].   Activities of Daily Living (NAB) at 6 and 12 months [MD ‐1.20, 95%CI ‐2.22 to ‐0.18, P=0.02].   Global Assessment (CGI) at 3 months [MD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.75 to ‐0.21, P=0.0006], but not at later times.   Tolerability   There were minimal data on adverse effects and drop‐outs. There were a statistically significant treatment effects in favour of placebo at 12 months, for the number of dropouts [OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.90, P=0.03]. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence that propentofylline might benefit cognition, global function and activities of daily living of people with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia. The meta‐analyses reported here are far from satisfactory as a summary of the efficacy of propentofylline, considering the unpublished information on another 1200 patients in randomized trials that exists. Unfortunately Aventis has been unwilling to correspond with the authors, significantly limiting the scope of this review. Plain language summary Limited evidence that propentofylline benefits cognition, global function and activities of daily living in people with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia Propentofylline is a novel putatively neuroprotective agent that acts by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine and blocking the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Although a number of randomized controlled trials have been undertaken, data were available from only a very limited number of these studies. These limited data suggest that propentofylline may have a beneficial effect on measures of cognitive and global function of people with Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The unavailability of data, due to failure of Aventis, the manufacturing pharmaceutical company, to release information about unpublished studies prevented a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with their initial antipsychotic drug treatment. Sometimes a second antipsychotic, in combination with the first, is used in these situations. Objectives To examine whether: 1. treatment with antipsychotic combinations is effective for schizophrenia; and  2. treatment with antipsychotic combinations is safe for the same illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We ran searches in September 2010, August 2012 and January 2016. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of included trials. Selection criteria We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing antipsychotic combinations with antipsychotic monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from the included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% CIs. For the meta‐analysis we used a random‐effects model. We used GRADE to complete a 'Summary of findings' table and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results Sixty‐two studies are included in the review, 31 of these compared clozapine monotherapy with clozapine combination. We considered the risk of bias in the included studies to be moderate to high. The majority of trials had unclear allocation concealment, method of randomisation and blinding, and were not free of selective reporting. There is some limited evidence that combination therapy may be superior to monotherapy in reducing the risk of no clinical response (RR 0.73 CI 0.64 to 0.83; participants = 2398; studies = 29;  very low‐quality evidence ), subgroup analyses show that the positive result was due to the studies with clozapine in both the monotherapy and combination groups (RR 0.66 CI 0.53 to 0.83; participants = 1127; studies = 17) and typical in both groups (RR 0.64 CI 0.49 to 0.84; participants = 597; studies = 5). The subgroup with atypical antipsychotics in both groups did not showed a difference between the two interventions (RR 0.95 CI 0.83 to 1.09; participants = 674; studies = 7). Three studies provided data regarding relapse, the pooled data showed high heterogeneity (I² = 82%) and therefore the results were not pooled. Two studies showed no difference between the interventions and one study showed that antipsychotics combination might decrease the risk of relapse. A combination of antipsychotics was not superior or inferior to antipsychotic monotherapy in reducing the number of participants discontinuing treatment early (RR 0.90 CI 0.76 to 1.07; participants = 3137; studies = 43,  low‐quality evidence ). No difference was found between treatment groups in the number of participants hospitalised (RR 0.96 CI 0.36 to 2.55; participants = 202; studies = 3,  very low‐quality evidence ). We did not find evidence of a difference between treatment groups in serious adverse events or those requiring discontinuation (RR 1.05 CI 0.65 to 1.69; participants = 2398; studies = 30,  very low‐quality evidence ). There is a lack of evidence on clinically important change in quality of life, with only four studies reporting average endpoint or change data for this outcome on three different scales, none of which showed a difference between treatment groups. Authors' conclusions Currently, most evidence regarding the use of antipsychotic combinations comes from short‐term trials, limiting the assessment of long‐term efficacy and safety. We found very low‐quality evidence that a combination of antipsychotics may improve the clinical response. We also found very low‐quality evidence that a combination of antipsychotics may make no difference at preventing participants from leaving the study early, preventing relapse and/or causing more serious adverse events than monotherapy. Plain language summary Combining antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia Background Antipsychotic medication was introduced in the 1950s to reduce or alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the psychotic states of hearing voices, visual hallucinations and strange thoughts such as paranoia (feeling singled‐out or put upon by others). Medication for mental illness also helped to establish care in the community, because people could take medication in their homes or by regularly visiting the hospital. But this also led to new issues such as the effectiveness of different medication (taken alone or in combination) and compliance (the willingness of service users to take their medication without being supervised). The range of antipsychotic medication available is wide and their effectiveness can also vary from individual to individual. In addition, not all patients fully respond to a single antipsychotic, and in these situations, a combination of antipsychotics are often prescribed. The evidence for the benefits of taking one or more antipsychotics in combination is often unclear. There are also differing profiles of typical (first generation) and atypical (second generation) antipsychotics adding to a confusing array of terminology and dilemma of what is the best medication for service users. Searches This review investigates the effects of different antipsychotic combinations compared with single antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Searches for randomised controlled trials have now been run by the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophenia Group in 2010, 2012 and 2016. Sixty‐two trials, reporting useable data, are included in the review. Main results The review of available evidence found that combinations of antipsychotics may be more effective in treating symptoms of schizophrenia compared with taking one antipsychotic. In particular, combination treatments that included clozapine and typical antipsychotic in both groups were found to be effective. Few studies reported on this central issue of relapse rates (service users becoming unwell again), but this was because most of the studies were of short length (whereas schizophrenia is a long‐term health problem that requires studies of an equally long duration). No real differences were found between combinations of antipsychotics and single antipsychotics for preventing relapse and roughly equal numbers of people discontinued their treatment. There was also no difference between combination therapy and monotherapy regarding hospital admission and/or occurrence of serious adverse events. Numbers leaving the studies early were similar. Clinically meaningful data for quality of life were not reported. Conclusions These results show that there may be some clinical benefit for combination therapy in that more people receiving a combination of antipsychotic showed an improvement in symptoms. For other important outcomes such as relapse, hospitalisation, adverse events, discontinuing treatment or leaving the study early, no clear differences between the two treatment options were observed. However, these results are based on very low or low‐quality evidence and more research providing high‐quality evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be made.

AB: Abstract - Background Following the discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system and the identification of specific cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system, much work has been done to investigate the main effects of these compounds. There is increasing evidence that the cannabinoid system may regulate neurodegenerative processes such as excessive glutamate production, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Neurodegeneration is a feature common to the various types of dementia and this has led to interest in whether cannabinoids may be clinically useful in the treatment of people with dementia. Recent studies have also shown that cannabinoids may have more specific effects in interrupting the pathological process in Alzheimer's disease. Objectives To determine from available research whether cannabinoids are clinically effective in the treatment of dementia. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 11 April 2008 using the terms: cannabis or cannabinoid* or endocannabinoid*  or cannabidiol or THC or CBD or dronabinol or delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol or marijuana  or marihuana or hashish. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All double‐blind and single (rater)‐blind randomized placebo controlled trials assessing the efficacy of cannabinoids at any dose in the treatment of people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently examined the retrieved studies for inclusion according to the selection criteria. They then independently assessed the methodological quality of selected trials and extracted data where possible. Main results Only one study met the inclusion criteria. The data in the study report were presented in such a way that they could not be extracted for further analysis and there was insufficient quantitative data to validate the results. Authors' conclusions This review finds no evidence that cannabinoids are effective in the improvement of disturbed behaviour in dementia or in the treatment of other symptoms of dementia. More randomized double‐blind placebo controlled trials are needed to determine whether cannabinoids are clinically effective in the treatment of dementia. Plain language summary No evidence that cannabinoids are effective in the improvement of disturbed behaviour in dementia or in the treatment of other symptoms of dementia Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the cannabis plant ( Cannabis sativa ). Laboratory studies have indicated that cannabinoids may regulate some of the processes that lead to neurodegeneration. This suggests that cannabinoids could be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. So far, only one small randomized controlled trial has assessed the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of dementia. This study had poorly presented results and did not provide sufficient data to draw any useful conclusions.

AB: Abstract - Background Transcranial magnetic stimulation can either excite or inhibit cortical areas of the brain, depending on whether the speed of the repetitive stimulation is applied at high or low frequencies. It has been used for physiological studies and it has also been proposed as a treatment for depression. Objectives To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulationfor treating depression. Search methods An electronic search was performed including the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group trials register (last searched June 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1966‐2001), EMBASE (1974‐2001), PsycLIT (1980‐2001), and bibliographies from reviewed articles. Unpublished data and grey literature were searched through personal communications with researchers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression. Data collection and analysis All reviewers independently extracted the information and verified it by cross‐checking. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.   Continuous data: When similar studies were grouped, the overall standardised mean difference was calculated under a fixed effect model weighted by the inverse variance method with 95% confidence intervals. (In the presence of statistical heterogeneity, a random effects model was to be used.) Main results Sixteen trials were included in the review and fourteen contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. Most comparisons did not show differences between rTMS and other interventions. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, except for one time period (after two weeks of treatment) for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency; and also for right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low frequency, both in favour of rTMS and both using the Hamilton scale. Comparison of rTMS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency) with electroconvulsive therapy showed no difference except for psychotic patients after two weeks treatment, using the Hamilton scale, which indicated that electroconvulsive therapy was more effective than rTMS. Authors' conclusions The information in this review suggests that there is no strong evidence for benefit from using transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat depression, although the small sample sizes do not exclude the possibility of benefit.

AB: Abstract - Background Psychotherapeutic approaches, mainly cognitive behavior therapy, and antidepressant medication are the two treatment modalities that have received most support in controlled outcome studies of bulimia nervosa. Objectives The primary objective was to conduct a systematic review of all RCTs comparing antidepressants with psychological approaches or comparing their combination with each single approach for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Search methods (1) electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980‐December 2000) , PsycLIT (to December 2000), LILACS & SCISEARCH (to 1999)   (2) the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register ‐ ongoing   (3) handsearches of the references of all identified trials   (4) contact with the pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigator of each included trial   (5) handsearch of the International Journal of Eating Disorders ‐ ongoing Selection criteria Inclusion criteria: every randomized controlled trial in which antidepressants were compared with psychological treatments or the combination of antidepressants with psychological approaches was compared to each treatment alone, to reduce the symptoms of bulimia nervosa in patients of any age or gender.   Quality criteria: reports were considered adequate if they were classified as A or B according to the Cochrane Manual. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers for each included trial. The main outcome for efficacy was full remission of bulimic symptoms, defined as 100% reduction in binge or purge episodes from baseline to endpoint. Dichotomous data was evaluated by the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals around this measure, based on the random effects model; continuous data was evaluated by the average difference and the 95% confidence interval. Number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated using the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. Main results Five trials were included in comparison one (antidepressants versus psychological treatments), five in comparison two (antidepressants versus the combination) and seven in comparison three (psychological treatments versus the combination). Remission rates were 20% for single antidepressants compared to 39% for single psychotherapy (DerSimonian‐Laird Relative Risk = 1.28; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.98;1.67). Dropout rates were higher for antidepressants than for psychotherapy (DerSimonian‐Laird Relative Risk = 2.18; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.09;4.35). The NNH for a mean treatment duration of 17.5 weeks was 4 (95% confidence interval = 3;11). Comparison two found remission rates of 42% for the combination versus 23% for antidepressants (DerSimonian‐Laird Relative Risk = 1.38; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.98;1.93). Comparison three showed a 36% pooled remission rate for psychological approaches compared to 49% for the combination (DerSimonian‐Laird Relative Risk = 1.21; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.02;1.45). The NNT for a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks was 8 (95% Confidence Interval = 4;320). Dropout rates were higher for the combination compared to single psychological treatments (DerSimonian‐Laird Relative Risk = 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.38;0.88). The NNH was 7 (95% Confidence Interval = 4;21). Authors' conclusions Using a more conservative statistical approach, combination treatments were superior to single psychotherapy. This was the only statistically significant difference between treatments. The number of trials might be insufficient to show the statistical significance of a 19% absolute risk reduction in efficacy favouring psychotherapy or combination treatments over single antidepressants. Psychotherapy appeared to be more acceptable to subjects. When antidepressants were combined with psychological treatments, acceptability of the latter was significantly reduced. Plain language summary Antidepressants and psychological treatments, alone or combined, for bulimia nervosa Psychotherapeutic approaches, mainly cognitive behavior therapy, and antidepressant medication are the two treatment modalities that have received most support in controlled outcome studies of bulimia nervosa.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003158
AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a common mental health problem affecting 5% of those over 65. Various pathological processes are linked to memory impairment in dementia, particularly those affecting the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. Acetyl‐l‐carnitine (ALC) is derived from carnitine and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial in dementia. These include activity at cholinergic neurons, membrane stabilization and enhancing mitochondrial function. Work on the effects of ALC has been ongoing since the 1980s yet the mechanism of efficacy of ALC in cognitive decline remains unclear. Early studies suggested a beneficial effect of ALC on cognition and behaviour in aging subjects. However, later, larger studies have not supported these findings. Some of the difficulties lie in the differences in methodology and assessment tools used in the early and later studies. They are therefore difficult to compare. ALC is not currently in routine clinical use. Objectives To establish whether Acetyl‐l‐carnitine is clinically effective in the treatment of people with dementia. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS on 8 November using the terms acetyl‐l‐carnitine, l‐carnitine acetyl ester, acetylcarnitine, ALC. The search in November 2007 revealed no new studies. Selection criteria All double‐blind, randomized, trials involving people with dementia in which treatment with ALC was compared with a placebo group Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by a reviewer (SH) and entered into RevMan 4.2 software. Where possible intention‐to‐treat data were used, but most of the analyses were of completers (people who completed the study). Main results There are sixteen included trials, all of which included participants with mild‐moderate dementia or cognitive decline. All trials assessed the cognitive effects of ALC and in addition most considered severity of dementia, functional ability and clinical global impression.   When considering clinical global impression (CGI‐I) as a dichotomous variable (numbers improved versus numbers unchanged or worse) there were statistically significant treatment effects in favour of ALC at 12 and 24 weeks, (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.90, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.76) and (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.14) but not at 52 weeks (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.43). There was also a statistically significant treatment effect on MMSE at 24 weeks (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.69, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.29, P = 0.02), but not at 12 or 52 weeks. There was no evidence of benefit of ALC in the areas of severity of dementia, functional ability or Clinical Global Impression as a continuous measure.   Various adverse events were reported, but from the meta‐analyses there were no statistically significant differences between treated and placebo groups. Authors' conclusions There is evidence for benefit of ALC on clinical global impression as a categorical measure and on MMSE at 24 weeks, but there is no evidence using objective assessments in any other area of outcome. Given the large number of comparisons made, the statistically significant results may be due to chance. At present there is no evidence to recommend its routine use in clinical practice. Many of the trials used rather vague descriptions of dementia and trials using more strictly defined groups may be informative. Individual patient data may add to the findings, as would trials including other outcomes (e.g. mood and caregiver quality of life). However, the evidence does not suggest that ALC is likely to prove an important therapeutic agent. More work on the pharmacokinetics of ALC in humans is also required. Plain language summary No evidence of benefit of Acetyl‐l‐carnitine for dementia Acetyl‐l‐carnitine (ALC) is derived from carnitine and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial in dementia. Early studies suggested a beneficial effect of ALC on cognition and behaviour in aging subjects. However, later, larger studies have not supported these findings. The early and later studies differ widely in methodology and assessment tools used, and are therefore difficult to compare. There is no evidence of benefit of ALC in the areas of cognition, severity of dementia, functional ability or Clinical Global Impression as a continuous measure. An apparent beneficial effect on Clinical Global Impression assessed as a dichotomous variable may be due to chance. There was also a significant treatment effect on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 24 weeks, but this result must be interpreted with caution in the context of significant heterogeneity in these trials. ALC is not currently in routine clinical use.

AB: Abstract - Background There is evidence suggesting that people with serious mental illness are less responsive to everyday social rewards such as praise. Motivation and performance in social situations can be poor. Rewarding of tasks with money improves motivation to complete the tasks in everyday life. Careful use of targeted monetary rewards could also help people with troublesome symptoms of schizophrenia. Objectives To assess the effect of monetary incentive/rewards for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 2008). Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials comparing monetary rewards with standard care or no monetary rewards. Data collection and analysis Working independently, we selected studies for quality assessment and extracted relevant data. We analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated the Relative Risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data we calculated weighted mean differences (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals. Main results Five trials are excluded that investigate one type of monetary reward over another and may be included in a future update. We did include one study, carried out over 40 years ago, randomising a total of 25 very chronically ill people who had been in hospital an average of 20 years. The targeted task that was being encouraged was assembly of dolls. People allocated to the payment group produced less dolls than those not paid at all although this difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (MD ‐0.80 CI ‐1.44 to ‐0.16). Authors' conclusions Monetary rewards have been the topic for sporadic evaluative research for decades and this review shows that randomised studies are possible. We suggest a design for a future informative trial. Plain language summary Monetary incentives for schizophrenia Money incentivises many. It has been used in experiments to promote various behaviours in people with schizophrenia. We found six trials, but only one compared monetary incentives to no incentives which was the focus of this particular review. This one, very small, study was undertaken in the early 1960s with people who had been in hospital for an average of two decades. It found no clear effect but little can be concluded from this outdated trial except that such studies are possible. We think more studies relevant to current circumstances are desirable.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004032
AB: Abstract - Background Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the application of an electrical current through electrodes attached to the skin. The commonest clinical application of TENS is pain control. TENS is also used occasionally for the treatment of a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions including drug and alcohol dependence, headaches, and depression. TENS is rarely used for the treatment of dementia. However, since the early 1990s a number of studies carried out by a group in the Netherlands, and one study carried out by a group in Japan, suggest that TENS applied to the back or head may improve cognition and behaviour in patients with Alzheimer's disease or multi‐infarct dementia. It was claimed that applying TENS could benefit patients with dementia by altering the activity of various neurotransmitters, or by increasing brain activity and thereby retarding neural degeneration and stimulating regenerative processes. It is claimed that application of TENS to the head may also alleviate the sleep disorders associated with dementia. Objectives The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the treatment of dementia. Secondary objectives of this review are to determine whether any effect of treatment of dementia with TENS is influenced by any treatment parameters or patient features, including: the duration of treatment, electrical waveform, current amplitude, pulse duration and frequency and the patient's type or severity of cognitive impairment. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 5 December 2005 using the terms TENS, transcutaneous, "transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation", "electric stimulation", or "cranial electrostimulation" or "cranial stimulation". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is regularly updated. Selection criteria All RCTs in which TENS was used as an intervention for people with dementia were included in this review. This included peripherally applied transcutaneous electrical stimulation as well as transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied to the head (also known as cranial electrical stimulation (CES)). Data collection and analysis All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the review and for which sufficient data were available were included in this meta‐analysis. Two reviewers extracted the data from the included trials. All except one of the included trials used similar outcome measures. Data of the same outcome measures were combined for analysis. Main results Nine trials were included in the review but only 3 trials could be included in the meta‐analysis. Sufficient data to include the other trials in the meta‐analysis could not be obtained. From this limited analysis it appears that TENS produced a statistically significant improvement directly after treatment in: delayed recall of 8 words in one trial, face recognition in two trials and motivation in one trial. However, no effect of TENS was found on any of the many other neuropsychological and behavioural measures evaluated either directly after TENS treatment or 6 weeks after treatment was completed. Authors' conclusions Although a number of studies suggest that TENS may produce short lived improvements in some neuropsychological or behavioural aspects of dementia, the limited presentation and availability of data from these studies does not allow definite conclusions on the possible benefits of this intervention. Since most of the currently published studies are well designed, although the numbers of subjects in each study is small, analysis of the complete original data from these and/or future studies may allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn. Plain language summary Insufficient data to determine the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for dementia Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is rarely used for the treatment of dementia but has been studied in a number of randomized controlled trials. Although the available data suggests TENS may be beneficial for some neuropsychological and/or behavioural aspects of dementia insufficient data was available to these reviewers for definitive conclusions to be drawn.

AB: Abstract - Background Almitrine‐raubasine combination (brand name Duxil), has been considered as an alternative treatment for dementia. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Duxil in the treatment of patients with dementia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register (now known as  ALOIS ) (September 2009), the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM‐disc 1979 to December 2009), the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (www.cnki.net 1979 to December 2009), the Stroke Trials Registry at www.strokecentre.org/trials/index.aspx. We searched identified citations for additional trials, contacted the first author of identified trials for additional references and unpublished data. We also contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing Duxil (Servier Pharmaceutical Co Ltd) for additional unpublished data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials studying the efficacy and safety of Duxil for dementia were included, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. If the trial was cross‐over in nature, only data from the first period were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Main results Three trials involving a total of 206 participants were included, all patients with vascular dementia. All three included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. When analysing these trials together, there was significant beneficial effect of Duxil on the improvement of cognitive function measured by MMSE (WMD 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.66). No data on behaviour and death at the end of treatment and follow‐up were available from the included trials. Two trials failed to show an improvement of functional performance measured by ADL (WMD ‐1.68; 95% CI ‐3.70 to 0.35). Of the three included trials, all described the adverse events in detail, there were no statistically significant differences across the trials (OR 4.84, 95%CI 0.55 to 42.67). Behaviour disturbance, quality of life, caregiver burden were not undertaken in the included trials. Authors' conclusions Due to the low methodological quality of included trials, small number of trials and probable publication bias, this review did not provide sufficient evidence to support the routine use of Duxil for the treatment of patients with dementia. High‐quality and large‐scale randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm or refute these results. Plain language summary Almitrine‐Raubasine combination for dementia There is currently insufficient evidence on the effects of the combination of almitrine and raubasine (Duxil) for dementia.   Duxil is described as having several properties which may be beneficial for dementia. This review looked for randomized trials comparing Duxil with control in patients with dementia. Three trials were identified. Though there was significant beneficial effect of Duxil on the improvement of cognitive function, due to the low methodological quality of included trials, small number of trials and probable publication bias, this review did not provide sufficient evidence to support the routine use of Duxil for the treatment of patients with dementia. More large, high‐quality randomized trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background People with serious mental illness have consistently higher levels of mortality and morbidity than the general population. They have greater levels of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes, and respiratory illness. Although genetics may have a role in the physical health problems of these people, lifestyle and environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity play a prominent part. Objectives To review the effects of dietary advice for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (September 09, 2013 and February 24, 2016). Selection criteria We planned to include all randomised clinical trials focusing on dietary advice versus standard care. Data collection and analysis The review authors (RP, KTP) independently screened search results but did not identify any studies that fulﬁlled the review’s criteria. Main results We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Dietary advice has been shown to improve the dietary intake of the general population. Research is needed to determine whether dietary advice can have a similar benefit in people with serious mental illness. Plain language summary Dietary advice for people with schizophrenia The physical health of people with serious mental illness is often poor. Mortality levels remain about twice those of the general population. They are at greater risk of health problems such as heart disease, respiratory problems, and diabetes. The factors contributing to these health problems include higher levels of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a nutritionally poor intake of food. The aim of this review was to determine whether offering dietary advice to people with schizophrenia would lead to an improvement in their dietary intake and health. We ran a search for trials in 2013 using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials. We looked for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either dietary advice plus their normal treatment or their normal treatment but without dietary advice. We did not include trials where dietary advice was given in combination with another treatment, for example, with exercise therapy. We were unable to include any trials. Currently there is no good quality evidence available to help people determine if dietary advice is effective for people with schizophrenia. More research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Neuroleptic drugs are controversial treatments in dementia, with evidence accumulating that they may hasten clinical decline. Despite these concerns, they are commonly prescribed for elderly and demented patients. Thioridazine, a phenothiazine neuroleptic, has been commonly prescribed because it was thought to produce relatively less frequent motor side effects. The drug has significant sedative effect, and it is thought that this is the main mechanism of action in calming and controlling the patient. However, pharmacologically, it also has marked anticholinergic properties that could potentially have a detrimental effect on cognitive function. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of thioridazine in dementia in terms of:   1) efficacy in controlling symptoms   2) cognitive outcome for the patient   3) safety Search methods The CDCIG Specialised register of trials was searched on 13 March 2009 using the terms 'thioridazine' and 'melleril'. This register contains up to date references from major health care databases like MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as records from trials databases in the field of dementia. Selection criteria Unconfounded, single‐blind or double‐blind, randomised trials were identified in which treatment with thioridazine was administered for more than one dose and compared to an alternative intervention in patients with dementia of any aetiology. Trials in which allocation to treatment or comparator were not truly random, or in which treatment allocation was not concealed, were reviewed but are not included in the data analysis. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by the reviewers (VK, CAK and RJH). For continuous and ordinal variables, the main outcome measures of interest were the final assessment score and the change in score from baseline to the final assessment. The assessment scores were provided by behavioural rating scales, clinical global impression scales, functional assessment scales, psychometric test scores, and frequency and severity of adverse events. Data were pooled where appropriate or possible, and the Peto odds ratio (95%CI) or the weighted mean difference (95%CI) estimated. Where possible, intention to treat data were used. Main results The meta‐analysis showed that, compared with placebo, thioridazine reduced anxiety symptoms as evidenced by changes on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. However, there was no significant effect on clinical global change, and a non‐significant trend for higher adverse effects with thioridazine. Compared to diazepam, thioridazine was superior in terms of some anxiety symptoms, with similar adverse effects. Global clinical evaluation scales did not favour either treatment. Compared to chlormethiazole, thioridazine was significantly inferior when assessed on some items of the CAPE and the Crichton Geriatric Behavioural Rating Scales. Thioridazine was also associated with significantly more dizziness. No superiority for thioridazine was shown in comparisons with etoperidone, loxapine or zuclopenthixol, except to produce fewer side effects than loxapine. Authors' conclusions Very limited data are available to support the use of thioridazine in the treatment of dementia. If thioridazine were not currently in widespread clinical use, there would be inadequate evidence to support its introduction. The only positive effect of thioridazine when compared to placebo is the reduction of anxiety. When compared to placebo, other neuroleptics, and other sedatives, it has equal or higher rates of adverse effects. Clinicians should be aware that there is no evidence to support the use of thioridazine in dementia, and its use may expose patients to excess side effects. Plain language summary No evidence to support the use of thioridazine for dementia Behavioural problems are common in dementia and are a significant source of caregiver burden. Thioridazine has significant sedative effect, and it is thought that this is the main mechanism of action in calming and controlling the patient. However, pharmacologically, it also has marked anticholinergic properties that could potentially have a detrimental effect on cognitive function. The only positive effect of thioridazine when compared with placebo is to reduce anxiety. When compared with placebo, other neuroleptics, and other sedatives it has equal or higher rates of adverse effects. Thioridazine has minimal or no effect on global ratings, while other drugs such as chlormethiazole are superior to it on behavioural ratings. Clinicians should be aware that there is no evidence to support the use of thioridazine in dementia, and its use may expose patients to excess side effects.

AB: Abstract - Background CDP‐choline (cytidine 5'‐diphosphocholine) is a precursor essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, one of the cell membrane components that is degraded during cerebral ischaemia to free fatty acids and free radicals. Animal studies suggest that CDP‐choline may protect cell membranes by accelerating resynthesis of phospholipids. CDP‐choline may also attenuate the progression of ischaemic cell damage by suppressing the release of free fatty acids. CDP‐choline is the endogenous compound normally produced by the organism. When the same substance is introduced as a drug it can be called citicoline. CDP‐choline is mainly used in the treatment of disorders of a cerebrovascular nature. The many years of its presence in the clinical field have caused an evolution in dosage, method of administration, and selection criteria of patients to whom the treatments were given. Modalities of the clinical studies, including length of observation, severity of disturbance, and methodology of evaluation of the results were also heterogeneous. In spite of uncertainties about its efficacy due to these complexities, CDP‐choline is a frequently prescribed drug for cognitive impairment in several European countries, especially when the clinical picture is predominantly one of cerebrovascular disease, hence the need for this review. Due to its effects on the adrenergic and dopaminergic activity of the CNS, CDP‐choline has also been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Objectives To assess the efficacy of CDP‐choline (cytidinediphosphocholine) in the treatment of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders in the elderly. Search methods The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 22 April 2004 using the terms CDP‐choline, CDP, citicoline, cytidine diphosphate choline or diphosphocholine. The Register contains records from all major health‐care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. Selection criteria All relevant unconfounded, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized trials of CDP‐choline for cognitive impairment due to chronic cerebral disorders were considered for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently reviewed the included studies, extracted the data, and pooled it when appropriate and possible. The pooled odd ratios (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) or the average differences (95% CI) were estimated. No intention‐to‐treat data were available from the studies included. Main results Fourteen studies were included in this review. Some of the included studies did not present numerical data suitable for analysis. Description of participants varied over the years and by type of disorders and severity, and ranged from aged individuals with subjective memory disorders to patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (mild to moderate), Vascular Dementia or Senile Dementia (mild to moderate). Seven of the included studies observed the subjects for a period between 20 to 30 days, one study was of 6 weeks duration, four studies used periods extending over 2 and 3 months, one study observed continuous administration over 3 months and one study was prolonged, with 12 months of observation. The studies were heterogeneous in dose, modalities of administration, inclusion criteria for subjects, and outcome measures. Results were reported for the domains of attention, memory testing, behavioural rating scales, global clinical impression and tolerability. There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of CDP‐choline on attention. There was evidence of benefit of CDP‐choline on memory function and behaviour. The drug was well tolerated. Authors' conclusions There was some evidence that CDP‐choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short to medium term. The evidence of benefit from global impression was stronger, but is still limited by the duration of the studies. Further research with CDP‐choline should focus on longer term studies in subjects who have been diagnosed with currently accepted standardised criteria, especially Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (VaMCI) or vascular dementia. Plain language summary Some evidence that CDP‐choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short/medium term in elderly people with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders of the brain Patients with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebrovascular disorders may not respond to anti‐dementia treatments in the same manner as can be observed in cases of Alzheimer's dementia. There is some evidence that CDP‐choline provides modest but consistent improvement of memory and behaviour in these patients. These findings, however, are limited by the relatively short‐term of clinical controlled observations which in all studies but one lasted for no more than three months. Subjective evaluations of these patients as given by their doctors were consistently positive and no noticeable side effects were evidenced in the various studies over the years.

AB: Abstract - Background Safe interventions to enhance cognitive function in cognitively healthy people would be very valuable for several reasons ,  including a better quality of life and professional success. While L‐carnitine has been reported to enhance cognitive function in some conditions, its efficacy is disputed. The evidence of its efficacy for cognitively healthy people has not previously been systematically reviewed. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of L‐carnitine for the enhancement of cognitive function in people without cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 4 November 2016. We used the search terms 'L‐carnitine' or 'acetyl‐L‐carnitine' or 'propionyl‐L‐carnitine' or 'ALC' or 'PLC' or 'ALCAR' or 'ALPAR' .  We ran additional separate searches in several other sources to ensure that we retrieved the most up‐to‐date results. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised controlled trials identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. Selection criteria Eligible trials were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs, parallel‐group or cross‐over, that compared L‐carnitine or its derivatives, acetyl‐L‐carnitine or propionyl‐L‐carnitine, at any dose and for any length of treatment, with placebo or no treatment in cognitively healthy people of any age and either gender. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected trials and evaluated the methodological quality, then extracted and analysed data from the included trials. Main results Only two RCTs were eligible. One was a cross‐over trial with 18 participants. The other randomised 400 participants to one of four treatments, of which two (L‐carnitine and placebo) were relevant to this review, but the exact numbers of participants in these two treatment groups was not reported. All participants were young adults. Methodological details were poorly reported, and we considered the risk of bias in both studies to be unclear. The trials assessed different cognitive outcomes. We could extract cognitive data on approximately 200 participants from one trial. We found no evidence that L‐carnitine has any effect on reaction time, vigilance, immediate memory, or delayed recall after three days of treatment. This trial report stated that there was a small number of adverse effects, none of which were serious. The small cross‐over trial also reported no effect of L‐carnitine on cognition, but did not provide data; no information was provided on adverse effects. We considered the available evidence to be of very low quality for all reported outcomes. Authors' conclusions Due to the limited number of included trials, short‐term treatment, and inadequate reporting, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of L‐carnitine for cognitive enhancement in healthy adults. Well‐designed, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of L‐carnitine for cognition enhancement in cognitively healthy people, with large samples and relatively long‐term follow‐up, are still needed. Plain language summary L‐carnitine for cognitive enhancement in people without cognitive impairment Background Cognition (or cognitive function) is a term used to describe thinking skills, including attention, memory, and reasoning. Supplements and drugs are sometimes used by healthy people to try to improve cognitive function and perform better at work or while studying. These supplements and drugs are known as cognitive enhancers. L‐carnitine, which is found naturally in the diet, especially in meat, but can also be produced in the body, has been suggested as a possible cognitive enhancer. It is sold on its own as a dietary supplement and is found in some mixed supplements or 'energy drinks'. In this review, we searched for clinical trials in which healthy people taking L‐carnitine were compared with similar people taking a dummy pill (placebo). We hoped to learn whether or not L‐carnitine improves cognitive function and whether it is associated with side effects. Results We found only two trials to include in the review. One trial treated approximately 200 participants with L‐carnitine or placebo for three days; the other trial treated only 18 participants with only a single dose of L‐carnitine. Both trials included healthy young people with an average age of about 21. The trials measured different aspects of cognition using different tests. The smaller trial was only reported as an abstract, and there was no usable data, although the authors said that they found no evidence of an effect of L‐carnitine on cognitive function. Important information was missing from the paper describing the other trial, but we found no evidence that L‐carnitine had any effect on any of the aspects of cognition that were measured. Only the report of the larger trial mentioned adverse effects of treatment, which were all described as minor and occurring equally among those receiving L‐carnitine and those receiving placebo. Quality of the evidence It was difficult to properly assess the quality of the included trials because of poor reporting. We considered there to be a serious risk of bias due to poor study methods, and further uncertainty about the results because the studies were so small. We also considered the studies to be too short to adequately address our research question. Due to these factors, we considered the quality of the evidence to be very low. Conclusions Given the limited amount of evidence of very low quality, we were not able to draw any conclusions about the effect of L‐carnitine on cognitive function or its safety in healthy people. Larger, better‐quality studies conducted over a longer period of time are needed to answer our review question.

AB: Abstract - Background Distraction techniques are a form of coping strategies used in cognitive behavioural techniques. They may be of value as an adjunctive treatment for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Objectives To review the effects of distraction techniques for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2003), manually searched reference lists and contacted relevant authors. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing distraction techniques with other treatments for schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. We excluded data where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up. For binary outcomes, we calculated a fixed effects risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), along with the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H). For continuous data we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD). Main results In terms of mental state, distraction techniques did not have a clear effect (n=60, 1 RCT, MD endpoint BPRS 1.60 CI ‐0.49 to 3.69). Distraction does not obviously engage people in the studies (n=159, 5 RCTs, RR leaving the study before completion 1.08 CI 0.72 to 1.63). Authors' conclusions Clinicians, researchers, policy makers and recipients of care cannot be confident of the effects of distraction techniques from the findings of this review. The few pioneering studies are small, short and poorly reported. Further data from already completed trials might help inform practice, but more trials do seem to be justified as some of these potentially simple techniques, even if their effect is negligible, could be widely implemented and prove more acceptable than other more intrusive treatments. Plain language summary Distraction techniques for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often suffer from hallucinations. Various forms of distraction from these hallucinations have been evaluated in trials, but reporting is poor, and the few studies are small and short. Although there is no evidence that they have a major effect, further trials are justified as some of these potentially simple techniques, even if their effect is negligible, could be widely implemented and prove more acceptable than other more intrusive treatments.

AB: Abstract - Background People with a serious mental illness are more likely to smoke more and to be more dependent smokers than the general population. This may be due to a wide range of factors that could include a common aetiology to both smoking and the illness, self medication, smoking to alleviate adverse effects of medications, boredom in the existing environment, or a combination of these factors. It is important to undertake this review to facilitate improvements in both the health and safety of people with serious mental illness who smoke, and to reduce the overall burden of costs (both financial and health) to the smoker and, eventually, to the taxpayer. Objectives To review the effects of smoking cessation advice for people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialized Trials Register up to 2 April 2015, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and trial registries. We also undertook unsystematic searches of a sample of the component databases (BNI, CINHAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO), up to 2 April 2015, and searched references of all identified studies Selection criteria We planned to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that focussed on smoking cessation advice versus standard care or comparing smoking cessation advice with other more focussed methods of delivering care or information. Data collection and analysis The review authors (PK, AC, and DB) independently screened search results but did not identify any trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. Main results We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated advice regarding smoking cessation for people with serious mental illness. The excluded studies illustrate that randomisation of packages of care relevant to smokers with serious mental illness is possible. Authors' conclusions People with serious mental illness are more likely to smoke than the general population. Yet we could not find any high quality evidence to guide the smoking cessation advice healthcare professionals pass onto service users. This is an area where trials are possible and needed. Plain language summary Specialised advice on stopping smoking for people with serious mental illness Review question Does specialised advice about the benefits of stopping smoking work for people with a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia? Background People with serious mental health problems are more likely to smoke and to smoke more heavily than the general population. Around 60% to 70% of people with schizophrenia smoke, whereas around 20% of the general population smoke. People with mental illness may smoke more due to a range of factors. There may be a direct causal link between mental illness and smoking or it may be that smoking helps people deal with the stress of mental illness, or helps with the side effects of medication, such as tiredness, drowsiness, and boredom, or both. However, smoking is very bad for people’s physical health in general and can lead to serious diseases such as cancer. The provision of specific advice from health professionals may help people with serious mental illness to stop smoking. Study characteristics The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials up to 2 April 2015 that investigated the effects of providing advice about the effects of smoking and the effects of stopping smoking to people with serious mental illness compared to no advice about stopping smoking.No trials that met the inclusion criteria of this review were found.. Key results Currently there is no high quality evidence from randomised trials to guide healthcare professionals about how effective giving advice is to help people stop smoking. It is therefore unclear if advice has any effect on helping people with serious mental illness stop smoking. Quality of the evidence Good quality Evidence relevant to smokers with serious mental illness is much needed, important. It is possible if a large, high quality trial is undertaken and gathers relevant, high quality evidence on advice to help people stop smoking.

AB: Abstract - Background Problems with memory which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia, usually called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), can be the first sign of an impending dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is no consensus on a definition or diagnostic criteria for MCI, and MCI remains a vague term and those so described are a heterogeneous population, consisting of people who may rapidly progress to dementia but also of people with stable cognitive deficits and some who may actually improve. Treatment in the very earliest stages of AD may delay progression to AD. Donepezil (Aricept, E2020), a cholinesterase inhibitor, has been shown to benefit all severities of AD including mild and it would be reasonable to investigate its efficacy for those with MCI. Objectives To assess the effects of donepezil in people with mild cognitive impairment but no diagnosis of dementia. Search methods We searched  ALOIS  ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 20 May 2010 using the term: donepezil and in combination with those studies in which the participants had mild cognitive impairment. Selection criteria All double blind, randomized trials in which treatment with donepezil was compared with placebo for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the published reports of the included studies, pooled where appropriate and the treatment effects or the risks and benefits estimated. Main results The three included studies, with a total of 782 patients, all with a MMSE greater than 23 points, identified similar patients for inclusion, but were quite different with respect to design and objective. Pooling results in a meta‐analysis was not possible.   In the first study the 13‐item ADAS‐Cog showed benefit associated with 10 mg/day donepezil compared with placebo at 24 weeks (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.29, p=0.007), but four other measures of cognitive function did not. The analysis of withdrawals before the end of treatment at 24 weeks, withdrawals due to an adverse event, and numbers experiencing an adverse event, showed a significant difference between the donepezil group and the placebo group in favour of placebo, (43/133 donepezil 23/137 placebo, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.22, p=0.003), (29/133 donepezil 10/137 placebo, OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.65 to 7.60, p=0.001), (116/133 donepezil, 100/137 placebo, OR 2.52 95% CI 1.34 to 4.76, p=0.004). Various adverse effects were recorded, and several types of event, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, leg cramps and abnormal dreams, were reported more frequently in the donepezil group compared with the placebo. In the second study there was a significant difference between the number of patients diagnosed with AD or another dementia between the donepezil group and the placebo group in favour of donepezil after one year of treatment (16/253 donepezil 38/259 placebo) (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72, p=0.003), but no difference after 3 years of treatment (63/253 donepezil 73/259 placebo) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.25, p=0.4). The third study assessed cognitive function but did not report the results. Authors' conclusions There are two included studies which reported results for cognitive function. One study demonstrated a modest treatment effect in cognitive function as assessed by ADAS‐Cog13 but not for other outcomes assessing different domains of cognitive function. Donepezil was associated with significantly more adverse effects compared with placebo, mostly gastrointestinal. From the second study, there is no evidence that donepezil delays the onset of AD. There is no evidence to support the use of donepezil for patients with MCI. The putative benefits are minor, short lived and associated with significant side effects. Plain language summary There is no evidence to support the use of donepezil for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The putative benefits are minor, short lived and associated with significant side effects Problems with memory which do not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia, usually called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), can be the first sign of an impending dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, but are not necessarily so. Some memory problems are temporary and some do not worsen. Treatment in the very earliest stages of AD may delay progression to AD. Donepezil (Aricept, E2020), a cholinesterase inhibitor, has been shown to benefit all severities of AD including mild and it is reasonable to investigate its efficacy for those with MCI. There is little evidence that donepezil improved cognitive function, and no evidence that donepezil delays progression to AD, but it was associated with significant side effects. There is no evidence to support the use of donepezil for patients with MCI.

AB: Abstract - Background A number of studies exist of interventions for wandering in the institutional setting, but much less work has been done on wandering in the domestic setting. The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear. In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering, it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Also, the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a 'one size fits all' kind of explanation is unlikely. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a 'trial and error' approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non‐pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects, in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment. This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non‐pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia. The secondary objective is to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available and to set an agenda for future research. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 11 June 2009 using the terms:exit* OR wander* OR elopement OR ambulat* OR walk*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing intervention with no intervention or usual treatment ('standard care') or another intervention. Data collection and analysis No suitable trials of non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention and management of wandering in the domestic setting were found. Main results As no randomised controlled trials were found, no results can be reported. Authors' conclusions There is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials of non‐pharmacological interventions for wandering in the domestic setting. Plain language summary No evidence of the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for domestic wandering in people with dementia due to lack of trials No randomised controlled trials were found that proved or disproved the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention or management of wandering in the domestic setting. Trials of music therapy, bright light therapy, reality orientation, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and therapeutic touch have been carried out with participants in institutional settings. This review discusses these interventions in the light of their relevance to the domestic setting. Trials of non‐pharmacological interventions in the domestic setting are urgently needed.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009546.pub2
AB: Abstract - Background Treatment of schizophrenia depends heavily on neuroleptic drugs. Hypersalivation is a common side effect when people with schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs. Hypersalivation can be an embarrassing and stigmatising problem, can affect quality of life and can result in discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment. It can also be difficult to treat. Objectives To summarise the best available evidence of the effects of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of non‐clozapine neuroleptic‐induced hypersalivation in people with schizophrenia. Clozapine‐induced hypersalivation has been addressed in another Cochrane review. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (15 November 2012) and inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant studies. We were to contact the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing an anticholinergic drug with placebo, no treatment, another anticholinergic drug or any other intervention. Data collection and analysis We inspected the results of the search to identify relevant studies. We were to extract data onto standard, simple forms. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane risk assessment tool. For binary outcomes, we were to calculate a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we were to estimate the mean difference between groups. Main results The search resulted in four potential studies; after inspection, all were excluded. Three studies were excluded because they involved people with clozapine‐induced hypersalivation ‐ a topic covered in another Cochrane review. The fourth study was excluded because it involved people with schizophrenia, mood disorders or other mental disorders who were suffering from clozapine‐ and non‐clozapine induced hypersalivation and were treated with Chinese medicines with unknown anticholinergic properties. People in the control group received an anticholinergic drug (artane) or an antihistamine (phenergan). It was not possible to separate clozapine‐ from non‐clozapine‐treated people in the intervention group, or to separate artane‐treated people from phenergan‐treated people in the control group. Authors' conclusions We have been unable to locate any studies addressing the question raised in this review. Accordingly, this empty review points out an important clinical problem that needs to be investigated via well‐designed and well‐conducted randomised trials. Clinicians and patients are likely to continue with their current dependence on clinical judgement and personal experience. Policy makers have no trial‐based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of hypersalivation induced by neuroleptics other than clozapine. They are likely to continue to rely on opinion and habit when making recommendations. Funders of studies may wish to make this important subgroup of people a priority in future research. Plain language summary Anticholinergic medication for excessive salivation caused by use of antipsychotics other than clozapine The first line of treatment of schizophrenia is usually antipsychotic drugs. These drugs help in the treatment of the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, these drugs often have serious side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, tiredness, apathy and lack of drive. Dribbling or drooling (hypersalivation) is another common side effect, which frequently occurs at night when asleep. This can be an embarrassing and stigmatising problem that can affect quality of life and cause people to stop their medication, which may result in relapse and going back into hospital. Dribbling and drooling can be difficult to treat; however, anticholinergic drugs can decrease production of saliva and dribbling. This review assessed the evidence for the benefit or harm of anticholinergic drugs used in treating hypersalivation caused by antipsychotic or neuroleptic medication. The review excluded the antipsychotic clozapine, as its role in causing hypersalivation has been the subject of another Cochrane review. The search was carried out 15 November 2012 and resulted in identification of four potential studies, but none could be included. Three of these were excluded because they involved clozapine‐related hypersalivation. The fourth study was excluded because it involved people with mood or other mental disorders and Chinese medicines. Dribbling or hypersalivation is an important problem that needs to be investigated via well‐designed research and randomised trials. Until such time, psychiatrists and patients are likely to continue their treatment of hypersalivation on the basis of daily clinical judgement and personal experience rather than hard evidence. Treatment of hypersalivation caused by antipsychotics or neuroleptics other than clozapine does not seem to have received adequate research attention to help guide practice. The review authors conclude that using anticholinergics to treat dribbling or hypersalivation caused by antipsychotic drugs other than clozapine cannot be justified without further study.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is usually considered an illness of young adulthood. However, onset after the age of 40 years is reported in 23% of patients hospitalised with schizophrenia. At least 0.1% of the world's elderly population have a diagnosis of late‐onset schizophrenia which seems to differ from earlier onset schizophrenia on a variety of counts including response to antipsychotic drugs. Objectives To assess the effects of antipsychotic drugs for elderly people with late‐onset schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2010) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information. We updated this search Janurary 2013 and added 48 new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials that compared antipsychotic drugs with other treatments for elderly people (at least 80% older than 65 years) with a recent (within five years) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia like illnesses. Data collection and analysis For the 2010 search, two new review authors (AE, AG) inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. We assessed methodological quality of trials using the criteria recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  AE and AG also independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Main results There were no included studies in the original version of this review (2002 search). The 2010 search for the current update produced 211 references, among which we identified 88 studies. Only one study met the inclusion criteria and was of acceptable quality. This was an eight‐week randomised trial of risperidone and olanzapine in 44 inpatients with late‐onset schizophrenia. All participants completed the eight‐week trial, indicating that both drugs were well tolerated. Unfortunately, this study provided little usable data. We excluded a total of 81 studies, 77 studies because they either studied interventions other than antipsychotic medication or because they involved elderly people with chronic ‐ not late‐onset ‐ schizophrenia. We excluded a further four trials of antipsychotics in late‐onset schizophrenia because of flawed design. Five studies are still awaiting classification, and one is on‐going. Authors' conclusions There is no trial‐based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of late‐onset schizophrenia. There is a need for good quality‐controlled clinical trials into the effects of antipsychotics for this group. Such trials are possible. Until they are undertaken, people with late‐onset schizophrenia will be treated by doctors using clinical judgement and habit to guide prescribing. Note: the 48 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Antipsychotic drugs for elderly people with late‐onset schizophrenia A significant proportion of the world's growing elderly population suffers from schizophrenia that started very late in life. Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat this distressing and severe illness. In this review we attempted to find good quality trial‐based evidence to support this practice but found none. Currently this vulnerable group is not well served by the research community.

AB: Abstract - Background Aggression is a disposition, a willingness to inflict harm, regardless of whether this is behaviourally or verbally expressed and regardless of whether physical harm is sustained. De‐escalation is a psychosocial intervention for managing people with disturbed or aggressive behaviour. Secondary management strategies such as rapid tranquillisation, physical intervention and seclusion should only be considered once de‐escalation and other strategies have failed to calm the service user. Objectives To investigate the effects of de‐escalation techniques in the short‐term management of aggression or agitation thought or likely to be due to psychosis. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (latest search 7 April, 2016). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials using de‐escalation techniques for the short‐term management of aggressive or agitated behaviour. We planned to include trials involving adults (at least 18 years) with a potential for aggressive behaviour due to psychosis, from those in a psychiatric setting to those possibly under the influence of alcohol or drugs and/or as part of an acute setting as well. We planned to include trials meeting our inclusion criteria that provided useful data. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors inspected all abstracts of studies identified by the search process. As we were unable to include any studies, we could not perform data extraction and analysis. Main results Of the 345 citations that were identified using the search strategies, we found only one reference to be potentially suitable for further inspection. However, after viewing the full text, it was excluded as it was not a randomised controlled trial. Authors' conclusions Using de‐escalation techniques for people with psychosis induced aggression or agitation appears to be accepted as good clinical practice but is not supported by evidence from randomised trials. It is unclear why it has remained such an under‐researched area. Conducting trials in this area could be influenced by funding flow, ethical concerns ‐ justified or not ‐ anticipated pace of recruitment as well the difficulty in accurately quantifying the effects of de‐escalation itself. With supportive funders and ethics committees, imaginative trialists, clinicians and service‐user groups and wide collaboration this dearth of randomised research could be addressed. Plain language summary De‐escalation techniques for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation Review question: Are de‐escalation techniques effective for managing psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation? Background Aggression is a willingness to inflict harm, regardless of whether this is behaviourally or verbally expressed and regardless of whether physical harm is sustained. De‐escalation is a psychosocial intervention for management of aggressive or agitated behaviour. It uses techniques that help someone with aggression or agitation to self‐monitor their emotions and self‐manage their behaviour to try and stop aggressive behaviour escalating. Searches We ran electronic searches (last searched April 2016) for trials that randomised people with psychosis who were displaying aggressive or agitated behaviour to receive de‐escalation techniques, standard care or other intervention to manage aggression. Three‐hundred and forty‐five records were found and checked by the review authors. Results No trials met the review requirements. There is no trial‐based evidence currently available assessing the effectiveness of de‐escalation techniques for managing aggression or agitation. Conclusions It is unclear why there are no randomised trials. Several issues such as cost, ethical considerations, difficulty recruiting people into trials, as well the ability to accurately quantify the effects of de‐escalation itself could all be contributing factors. Meanwhile, de‐escalation techniques are currently used without any trial‐based evidence that they are effective.

AB: Abstract - Background Postnatal psychosis is a worldwide life‐threatening condition that affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers. It has an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth. Affected new mothers rapidly develop frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganised behaviours. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include primiparous mothers who are single, women who are older, or with a past psychiatric history and family history of affective psychosis, prenatal depression and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and hormone therapy may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk. Objectives To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the search strategy of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. If we had included relevant trials, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  Two review authors would have independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat to benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Main results There are no included studies in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned trials that seem never to have started, and one which we excluded a study because it was a report of a case series. Authors' conclusions This is not an empty review ‐ it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite growing interest in women’s mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A  post hoc  PubMed topic (not methodology‐specific) search identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial‐based evidence upon which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well‐designed, well‐conducted, and well‐reported randomised studies. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority. Plain language summary Treatments to help prevent psychosis in women who have just given birth There is a small percentage of women for whom giving birth leads to psychosis. Postnatal psychosis affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers and is almost always a mood disorder accompanied by loss of contact with reality, hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations), having strange beliefs (delusions), severe thought disturbance, and abnormal behaviour. It can be a life‐threatening condition with an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth.    Postnatal psychosis is more common in first time mothers and the risk is greater for mothers who are single or in older age. Risk is also greater in those with past mental health problems, family history of mental illness, depression before pregnancy and hormone problems. The most common symptoms of postnatal psychosis are feeling excited, elated or high, not needing to sleep or the inability to sleep, feeling active and talking more or feeling very chatty. Other women with postnatal psychosis may have severe depression with delusions, hearing voices, little or no speech, mental numbness and stupor. Such symptoms are themselves distressing but can also lead to harmful behaviours which include suicide, child neglect and abuse, or even in some extreme cases killing their child. Without treatment postnatal psychosis can last many months, but if women do receive modern therapy the symptoms usually resolve within a few weeks, reducing the risk of harm to both mother and baby.  As well as treatment, prevention could save the lives of both the mother and her baby, improve the mother‐baby relationship, and lead to better family relationships. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, the early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy.     This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis. Unfortunately, no studies were found that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on postnatal psychosis is much needed. Despite a growing interest in women’s mental health, knowledge and research on postnatal psychosis is still very limited. Future well‐designed, well‐conducted and well‐reported studies are necessary to help improve prevention of symptoms and treatment for women with postnatal psychosis.

AB: Abstract - Background Poor compliance with treatment often means that many people with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness relapse and may need frequent and repeated hospitalisation. Information and communication technology (ICT) is increasingly being used to deliver information, treatment or both for people with severe mental disorders. Objectives To evaluate the effects of psychoeducational interventions using ICT as a means of educating and supporting people with schizophrenia or related psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (2008, 2009 and September 2010), inspected references of identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICT as a psychoeducational and supportive tool with any other type of psychoeducation and supportive intervention or standard care. Data collection and analysis We selected trials and extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias using the criteria described in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Main results We included six trials with a total of 1063 participants. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes (patient compliance and global state) between psychoeducational interventions using ICT and standard care. Technology‐mediated psychoeducation improved mental state in the short term (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.00; n = 30, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.90 to ‐0.12) but not global state (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.42). Knowledge and insight were not effected (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.15; n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.03). People allocated to technology‐mediated psychoeducation perceived that they received more social support than people allocated to the standard care group (n = 30, 1 RCT, MD 0.42, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.80). When technology‐mediated psychoeducation was used as an adjunct to standard care it did not improve general compliance in the short term (n = 291, 3 RCTs, RR for leaving the study early 0.81, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.19) or in the long term (n = 434, 2 RCTs, RR for leaving the study early 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.25). However, it did improve compliance with medication in the long term (n = 71, 1 RCT, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Adding technology‐mediated psychoeducation on top of standard care did not clearly improve either general mental state, negative or positive symptoms, global state, level of knowledge or quality of life. However, the results were not consistent regarding level of knowledge and satisfaction with treatment. When technology‐mediated psychoeducation plus standard care was compared with patient education not using technology the only outcome reported was satisfaction with treatment. There were no differences between groups. Authors' conclusions Using ICT to deliver psychoeducational interventions has no clear effects compared with standard care, other methods of delivering psychoeducation and support, or both. Researchers used a variety of methods of delivery and outcomes, and studies were few and underpowered. ICT remains a promising method of delivering psychoeducation; the equivocal findings of this review should not postpone high‐quality research in this area. Plain language summary Patient education and support for people with schizophrenia by using information and communication technology Information and Communication Technology (ICT) includes the use of computers, telephones, television and radio, video and audio recordings. It consists of all technical means used to handle information and communication. During the last twenty years there has been a growing trend towards the use of ICT for the delivery of education, treatment and social support for people with mental illness.  Education about illness and treatment has been found to be a good way to increase a person's awareness of their health. ICT has the potential to improve many aspects of overall care, including: better education and social support; improved information and management of illness; increased access to health services; improved quality of care; better contact and continuity with services and cut costs. Recent studies show that ICT and the web may also support people in their working lives and social relationships plus help cope with depression and anxiety. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the specific effectiveness of ICT for helping people with severe mental health problems such as schizophrenia. This review includes six studies with a total of 1063 people. Although education and support using ICT shows great promise, there was no clear benefit of using ICT (when compared with standard or usual care and/or other methods of education and support) for people with severe mental illness. However, the authors of the review suggest that this should not put off or postpone future high quality research on ICT, which is a promising and growing area of much importance.

AB: Abstract - Background Chronic antipsychotic drug treatment may cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a long‐term movement disorder. Gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist drugs, which have intense sedative properties and may exacerbate psychotic symptoms, have been used to treat TD. Objectives 1. Primary objective The primary objective was to determine whether using non‐benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs for at least six weeks was clinically effective for the treatment of antipsychotic‐induced TD in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses. 2. Secondary objectives The secondary objectives were as follows. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than six weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow‐up. To examine whether there was a differential effect between the various compounds. To test the hypothesis that GABA agonist drugs are most effective for a younger age group (less than 40 years old). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (last searched April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials, and, when necessary, contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of non‐benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs in people with antipsychotic‐induced TD and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted and analysed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We included 11 studies that randomised 343 people. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, participants and outcome assessors were not clearly blinded. For some studies we were unsure if data were complete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported. Data from six trials showed that there may be a clinically important improvement in TD symptoms after GABA agonist treatment compared with placebo at six to eight weeks follow‐up (6 RCTs, n = 258, RR 0.83, CI 0.74 to 0.92;  low‐quality evidence ). Data from five studies showed no difference between GABA agonist treatment and placebo for deterioration of TD symptoms (5 RCTs, n = 136, RR 1.90, CI 0.70 to 5.16; very low‐quality evidence). Studies reporting adverse events found a significant effect favouring placebo compared with baclofen, sodium valproate or progabide for dizziness/confusion (3 RCTs, n = 62 RR 4.54, CI 1.14 to 18.11;  very low‐quality evidence ) and sedation/drowsiness (4 RCTS, n = 144, RR 2.29, CI 1.08 to 4.86;  very low‐quality evidence ). Studies reporting on akathisia (RR 1.05, CI 0.32 to 3.49, 2 RCTs, 80 participants), ataxia (RR 3.25, CI 0.36 to 29.73, 2 RCTs, 95 participants), nausea/vomiting (RR 2.61, CI 0.79 to 8.67, 2 RCTs, 64 participants), loss of muscle tone (RR 3.00, CI 0.15 to 59.89, 1 RCT, 10 participants), seizures (RR 3.00, CI 0.24 to 37.67, 1 RCT, 2 participants), hypotension (RR 3.04, CI 0.33 to 28.31, 2 RCTs, 119 participants) found no significant difference between GABA drug and placebo ( very low‐quality evidence ). Evidence on mental state also showed no effect between treatment groups (6 RCTS, n = 121, RR 2.65, CI 0.71 to 9.86; v ery low‐quality evidence ) as did data for leaving the study early (around 10% in both groups, 6 RCTS, n = 218, RR 1.47, CI 0.69 to 3.15;  very low‐quality evidence ). No study reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, a group of outcomes selected as being of particular importance to patients. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain about the evidence of the effects of baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate or tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol (THIP) for people with antipsychotic‐induced TD. Evidence is inconclusive and unconvincing. The quality of data available for main outcomes ranges from very low to low. Any possible benefits are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their use. Plain language summary Gamma‐aminobutyric acid agonists for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question . To determine the effects of gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia for people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Background . People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high‐dose antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. GABA agonist drugs have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia but have intense sedative properties and may make mental health or psychotic symptoms worse. GABA agonist drugs include baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate, and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol (THIP). Study characteristics . The review includes 11 studies investigating the use of GABA agonist drugs compared with placebo. All studies involved small numbers of participants (2 to 80 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Key results . Evidence of the effects of GABA agonist drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is not conclusive and not convincing. Any possible benefits of GABA agonist drugs are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their use. Quality of the evidence . Evidence is weak, short term, small scale and poorly reported. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.

AB: Abstract - Background Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disfiguring movement disorder, often of the orofacial region, frequently caused by using antipsychotic drugs. A wide range of strategies have been used to help manage TD, and for those who are unable to have their antipsychotic medication stopped or substantially changed, the benzodiazepine group of drugs have been suggested as a useful adjunctive treatment. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive. Objectives To determine the effects of benzodiazepines for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other chronic mental illnesses. Search methods On 17 July 2015 and 26 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of each included trial for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) and antipsychotic‐induced TD that compared benzodiazepines with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of TD. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from the included studies and ensured that they were reliably selected, and quality assessed. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We synthesised continuous data from valid scales using mean differences (MD). For continuous outcomes, we preferred endpoint data to change data. We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. Main results The review now includes four trials (total 75 people, one additional trial since 2006, 21 people) randomising inpatients and outpatients in China and the USA. Risk of bias was mostly unclear as reporting was poor. We are uncertain about all the effects as all evidence was graded at very low quality. We found no significant difference between benzodiazepines and placebo for the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in TD' (2 RCTs, 32 people, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.09, very low quality evidence). Significantly fewer participants allocated to clonazepam compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) experienced no clinically important improvement (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). For the outcome 'deterioration of TD symptoms,' we found no clear difference between benzodiazepines and placebo (2 RCTs, 30 people, RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 9.82, very low quality evidence). All 10 participants allocated to benzodiazepines experienced any adverse event compared with 7/11 allocated to phenobarbital (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.41, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the incidence of participants leaving the study early for benzodiazepines compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 56 people, RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 48.04, very low quality evidence) or compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) (no events, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, which are outcomes designated important by patients. No trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or treatment as usual reported on adverse effects. Authors' conclusions There is only evidence of very low quality from a few small and poorly reported trials on the effect of benzodiazepines as an adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic‐induced TD. These inconclusive results mean routine clinical use is not indicated and these treatments remain experimental. New and better trials are indicated in this under‐researched area; however, as benzodiazepines are addictive, we feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are chosen. Plain language summary Benzodiazepines for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question To determine the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia or other similar mental health problems. Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations), and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary (uncontrollable and unintended) movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue, and jaw to convulse, spasm, and grimace. It is caused by prolonged or high‐dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat, and can be incurable. The benzodiazepine group of medicines have been suggested as a useful add‐on treatment for tardive dyskinesia. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive. Study characteristics The review includes four clinical trials with 75 people who had tardive dyskinesia as a result of using antipsychotic medicines. The participants were randomised into groups that received either their usual antipsychotic medicine plus a benzodiazepine or their usual antipsychotic plus a placebo (dummy medicine). Key results Improvement in TD symptoms was similar between the treatment groups. Participants were just as likely to leave the studies early from the placebo groups as the benzodiazepine groups. Data were not available for outcomes important to patients such as improvement in social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or quality of life. Quality of the evidence Evidence is limited because the trials are so few, small, and poorly reported. It is uncertain whether benzodiazepines are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The use of benzodiazepines for treating people with antipsychotic‐induced TD therefore remains experimental, and because they are highly addictive, a last resort. The low number of studies in this review strongly indicates that this is not an active area of research. To fully investigate whether benzodiazepines have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be more well‐designed, conducted and reported trials.

AB: Abstract - Background Patients with medically unexplained or functional somatic symptoms are common in primary care. Previous reviews have reported benefit from specialised interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy and consultation letters, but there is a need for treatment models which can be applied within the primary care setting. Primary care studies of enhanced care, which includes techniques of reattribution or cognitive behavioural therapy, or both, have shown changes in healthcare professionals' attitudes and behaviour. However, studies of patient outcome have shown variable results and the value of enhanced care on patient outcome remains unclear. Objectives We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of enhanced care interventions for adults with functional somatic symptoms in primary care. The intervention should be delivered by professionals providing first contact care and be compared to treatment as usual. The review focused on patient outcomes only. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) (all years to August 2012), together with Ovid searches (to September 2012) on MEDLINE (1950 ‐ ), EMBASE (1980 ‐ ) and PsycINFO (1806 ‐ ). Earlier searches of the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), CINAHL, PSYNDEX, SIGLE, and LILACS were conducted in April 2010, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2009. No language restrictions were applied. Electronic searches were supplemented by handsearches of relevant conference proceedings (2004 to 2012), reference lists (2011) and contact with authors of included studies and experts in the field (2011). Selection criteria We limited our literature search to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), primary care, and adults with functional somatic symptoms. Subsequently we selected studies including all of the following: 1) a trial arm with treatment as usual; 2) an intervention using a structured treatment model which draws on explanations for symptoms in broad bio‐psycho‐social terms or encourages patients to develop additional strategies for dealing with their physical symptoms, or both; 3) delivery of the intervention by primary care professionals providing first contact care; and 4) assessment of patient outcome. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened identified study abstracts. Disagreements about trial selections were resolved by a third review author. Data from selected publications were independently extracted and risk of bias assessed by two of three authors, avoiding investigators reviewing their own studies. We contacted authors from included studies to obtain missing information. We used continuous outcomes converted to standardised mean differences (SMDs) and based analyses on changes from baseline to follow‐up, adjusted for clustering. Main results We included seven studies from the literature search, but only six provided sufficient data for analyses. Included studies were European, cluster RCTs with adult participants seeing their usual doctor (in total 233 general practitioners and 1787 participants). Methodological quality was only moderate as studies had no blinding of healthcare professionals and several studies had a risk of recruitment and attrition bias. Studies were heterogeneous with regard to selection of patient populations and intensity of interventions. Outcomes relating to physical or general health (physical symptoms, quality of life) showed substantial heterogeneity between studies (I 2  > 70%) and post hoc analysis suggested that benefit was confined to more intensive interventions; thus we did not calculate a pooled effect. Outcomes relating to mental health showed less heterogeneity and we conducted meta‐analyses, which found non‐significant overall effect sizes with SMDs for changes at 6 to 24 months follow‐up: mental health (3 studies) SMD ‐0.04 (95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.10), illness worry (3 studies) SMD 0.09 (95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.22), depression (4 studies) SMD 0.07 (95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.20) and anxiety (2 studies) SMD ‐0.07 (95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.25). Effects on sick leave could not be estimated. Three studies of patient satisfaction with care all showed positive but non‐significant effects, and measures were too heterogeneous to allow meta‐analysis. Results on healthcare utilisation were inconclusive. We analysed study discontinuation and found that both short term and long term discontinuation occurred more often in patients allocated to the intervention group, RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.46) at 12 to 24 months. Authors' conclusions Current evidence does not answer the question whether enhanced care delivered by front line primary care professionals has an effect or not on the outcome of patients with functional somatic symptoms. Enhanced care may have an effect when delivered per protocol to well‐defined groups of patients with functional disorders, but this needs further investigation. Attention should be paid to difficulties including limited consultation time, lack of skills, the need for a degree of diagnostic openness, and patient resistance towards psychosomatic attributions. There is some indication from this and other reviews that more intensive interventions are more successful in changing patient outcomes. Plain language summary Enhancing GP care for people with unexplained physical symptoms: a review of the evidence Why is this review important? GPs see many people with physical symptoms or syndromes for which there is no apparent disease. GPs find it difficult to help patients with these ‘functional’ somatic symptoms, but specialist services can help those most severely affected. If GPs were able to offer similar treatments (enhanced care) within their surgeries, they might help patients more quickly and save resources. Who may be interested in this review? People affected by a range of unexplained physical symptoms or syndromes, and their carers GPs and practice nurses GP commissioning groups Medical schools Health economists What questions does the review aim to answer? Does training GPs to enhance care for patients with functional somatic symptoms improve physical or mental health outcomes? Which research studies were included in this review? Searching databases revealed six relevant studies, completed between 2000 and 2006 in north‐western Europe. To be included, studies needed to: involve GPs who had received training in ‘enhanced care’ before offering it to their own patients in the surgery; involve types of enhanced care which enabled patients with somatic symptoms to reconsider their physical problems, broadening their understanding to include psychological issues in order to improve their health and quality of life; measure both physical and mental health outcomes for patients; compare a group of patients who received the enhanced care with another group who did not. Altogether the six studies covered 233 GPs and 1787 patients. What does the evidence tell us? The review found that the relevant six studies varied in significant ways: how severe the patients’ symptoms were; the form and intensity of the enhanced care offered. These differences made the studies difficult to compare. Many people left the studies before the outcomes could be measured. Given these problems with comparing existing research, it is only possible to say: enhanced care may help people with functional somatic symptoms; more intensive enhanced care may be more effective than very brief interventions. What should happen next? Further research into this topic is needed to test how much and what type of enhanced care could be effective. Future research should take into account barriers that might prevent such treatments benefitting patients. These include: GPs’ lack of time or skills, and their low expectations that enhanced care might help patients; patients’ reluctance to accept non‐physical understandings of somatic symptoms.

AB: Abstract - Background There is currently much focus on provision of general physical health advice to people with serious mental illness and there has been increasing pressure for services to take responsibility for providing this. Objectives To review the effects of general physical healthcare advice for people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (last update search October 2012) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials. There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on general physical health advice for people with serious mental illness.. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results Seven studies are now included in this review. For the comparison of physical healthcare advice versus standard care we identified six studies (total n = 964) of limited quality. For measures of quality of life one trial found no difference (n = 54, 1 RCT, MD Lehman scale 0.20, CI ‐0.47 to 0.87,  very low quality of evidence ) but another two did for the Quality of Life Medical Outcomes Scale ‐ mental component (n = 487, 2 RCTs, MD 3.70, CI 1.76 to 5.64). There was no difference between groups for the outcome of death (n = 487, 2 RCTs, RR 0.98, CI 0.27 to 3.56,  low quality of evidence ). For service use two studies presented favourable results for health advice, uptake of ill‐health prevention services was significantly greater in the advice group (n = 363, 1 RCT, MD 36.90, CI 33.07 to 40.73) and service use: one or more primary care visit was significantly higher in the advice group (n = 80, 1 RCT, RR 1.77, CI 1.09 to 2.85). Economic data were equivocal. Attrition was large (> 30%) but similar for both groups (n = 964, 6 RCTs, RR 1.11, CI 0.92 to 1.35). Comparisons of one type of physical healthcare advice with another were grossly underpowered and equivocal. Authors' conclusions General physical health could lead to people with serious mental illness accessing more health services which, in turn, could mean they see longer‐term benefits such as reduced mortality or morbidity. On the other hand, it is possible clinicians are expending much effort, time and financial resources on giving ineffective advice. The main results in this review are based on  low or very low quality  data. There is some limited and poor quality evidence that the provision of general physical healthcare advice can improve health‐related quality of life in the mental component but not the physical component, but this evidence is based on data from one study only. This is an important area for good research reporting outcome of interest to carers and people with serious illnesses as well as researchers and fundholders. Plain language summary General physical health care advice for people with serious mental illness People with serious mental illness tend to have poorer physical health than the general population with a greater risk of contracting diseases and often die at an early age. In schizophrenia, for example, life expectancy is reduced by about 10 years. People with mental health problems have higher rates of heart problems (cardiovascular disease), infectious diseases (including HIV and AIDS), diabetes, breathing and respiratory disease, and cancer. Advising people on ways to improve their physical health is not without problems since there is often a perception, that advice offered is ineffective and will be ignored but it has been shown that healthcare professional advice can have a positive impact on behaviour. Advice can often motivate people to seek further support and treatment. Health advice could improve the quality and duration of life of people with serious mental illness. There is currently much focus on general physical health advice for people with serious mental illness with increasing pressure for health services to take responsibility for providing better advice and information. This review focuses specifically on studies of general physical health advice and excludes more targeted health interventions. Based on an electronic search carried out in 2012, this review now includes seven studies that randomised a total of 1113 people with serious mental illness. Six studies compared general physical health advice with standard care, one compared advice on healthy living with artistic techniques such as sketching and pottery. Information was of limited  low or very low quality , there were a small number of participants and findings were ambiguous. There is some limited evidence that the provision of physical healthcare advice can improve health‐related quality of life mentally but not physically. No studies returned results that suggest that physical healthcare advice has a powerful effect on physical healthcare behaviour or risk of ill health. More work is needed in this area. Only one adverse effect outcome was presented, death, but there were no differences between the treatment groups for this outcome. Funders and policy makers should be aware that there may be some benefit for physical health advice for people with serious mental illness. There is an increased demand for preventative health services that involve the provision of advice and which may also reduce costs to health services. This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray from RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background Social skills programmes (SSP) are treatment strategies aimed at enhancing the social performance and reducing the distress and difficulty experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and can be incorporated as part of the rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. Objectives The primary objective is to investigate the effects of social skills training programmes, compared to standard care, for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (November 2006 and December 2011) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. A further search for studies has been conducted by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2015, 37 citations have been found and are currently being assessed by review authors. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials for social skills programmes versus standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. Main results We included 13 randomised trials (975 participants). These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group. We found evidence in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. We also found that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were lower for social skills compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79,  very low quality evidence ), (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93,  very low quality evidence ) and participants’ mental state results (1 RCT, n = 91, MD ‐4.01 CI ‐7.52 to ‐0.50,  very low quality evidence ) were better in the group receiving social skill programmes. Global state was measured in one trial by numbers not experiencing a clinical improvement, results favoured social skills (1 RCT, n = 67, RR 0.29 CI 0.12 to 0.68,  very low quality evidence ). Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care (1 RCT, n = 112, MD ‐7.60 CI ‐12.18 to ‐3.02,  very low quality evidence ). However, when social skills programmes were compared to a discussion group control, we found no significant differences in the participants social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life, again the quality of evidence for these outcomes was  very low . Authors' conclusions Compared to standard care, social skills training may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates, but at present, the evidence is very limited with data rated as very low quality. When social skills training was compared to discussion there was no difference on patients outcomes. Cultural differences might limit the applicability of the current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills training can improve social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial. Plain language summary Social skills programmes for people with schizophrenia Social skills programmes (SSP) use behavioural therapy and techniques for teaching individuals to communicate their emotions and requests. This means they are more likely to achieve their goals, meet their needs for relationships and for independent living as well as getting on with other people and socially adjusting. Social skills programmes involve 'model learning' (role playing) which was introduced to improve general 'molecular' skills (eye contact, fluency of speech, gestures) and 'molar' skills (managing negative emotions, giving positive feedback). Social skills programmes enhance social performance and reduce the distress and difficulty experienced by people with schizophrenia. Social skills programmes can be incorporated as part of a rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. The main objective of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of social skills programmes, compared to standard care or discussion groups, for people with schizophrenia. Based on searches carried out in 2006 and 2011, this review includes 13 trials with a total of 975 participants. Authors chose seven main outcomes of interest, all data for these outcomes were rated to be very low quality. The review found significant differences in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. Rates of relapse were lower for social skills compared to standard care and there was a significant difference in favour of social skills on people’s mental state. Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care. However, when social skills programmes were compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in people’s social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life. Compared to standard care, social skills programmes may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates. However, at the moment evidence is very limited with data only of very low quality available. Cultural differences might also limit the relevance of current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills programmes or training can improve the social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be further investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.

AB: Abstract - Background Work disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until January 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs of work‐directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included sickness absence as an outcome. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to pool study results in the studies we judged to be sufficiently similar. We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 23 studies with 26 study arms, involving 5996 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. We judged 14 studies to have a high risk of bias and nine to have a low risk of bias. Work‐directed interventions We identified five work‐directed interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that a work‐directed intervention added to a clinical intervention reduced sickness absence (SMD ‐0.40; 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.14; 3 studies) compared to a clinical intervention alone. There was moderate quality evidence based on a single study that enhancing the clinical care in addition to regular work‐directed care was not more effective than work‐directed care alone (SMD ‐0.14; 95% CI ‐0.49 to 0.21). There was very low quality evidence based on one study that regular care by occupational physicians that was enhanced with an exposure‐based return to work program did not reduce sickness absence compared to regular care by occupational physicians (non‐significant finding: SMD 0.45; 95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.91). Clinical interventions, antidepressant medication Three studies compared the effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication on reducing sickness absence and yielded highly inconsistent results. Clinical interventions, psychological We found moderate quality evidence based on three studies that telephone or online cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective in reducing sick leave than usual primary or occupational care (SMD ‐0.23; 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.01). Clinical interventions, psychological combined with antidepressant medication We found low quality evidence based on two studies that enhanced primary care did not substantially decrease sickness absence in the medium term (4 to 12 months) (SMD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.12). A third study found no substantial effect on sickness absence in favour of this intervention in the long term (24 months). We found high quality evidence, based on one study, that a structured telephone outreach and care management program was more effective in reducing sickness absence than usual care (SMD ‐ 0.21; 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.05). Clinical interventions, exercise We found low quality evidence based on one study that supervised strength exercise reduced sickness absence compared to relaxation (SMD ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.54). We found moderate quality evidence based on two studies that aerobic exercise was no more effective in reducing sickness absence than relaxation or stretching (SMD ‐0.06; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.24). Authors' conclusions We found moderate quality evidence that adding a work‐directed intervention to a clinical intervention reduced the number of days on sick leave compared to a clinical intervention alone. We also found moderate quality evidence that enhancing primary or occupational care with cognitive behavioural therapy reduced sick leave compared to the usual care. A structured telephone outreach and care management program that included medication reduced sickness absence compared to usual care. However, enhancing primary care with a quality improvement program did not have a considerable effect on sickness absence. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on sickness absence of one antidepressant medication compared to another. More studies are needed on work‐directed interventions. Clinical intervention studies should also include work outcomes to increase our knowledge on reducing sickness absence in depressed workers. Plain language summary Interventions to help depressed people resume work Depression is a major problem that affects about 300 million people globally. Symptoms of depression include the core symptoms of low mood or loss of interest coupled with other symptoms such as feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness or sleep problems. These symptoms usually impair functioning and therefore sickness absence is common in people with depression. We evaluated the effectiveness of interventions that can help depressed workers to resume work activities. Studies we found We found 23 studies, involving 5996 participants, that looked at the effects on sick leave of changes at work that were in addition to regular treatment, better psychological treatment, improving primary care, antidepressant pills and exercise. Effects of changes at work in addition to regular care In three studies with 251 participants, researchers looked at changes at work such as work modification or coaching in addition to regular care and found that these reduced sickness absence to a moderate extent. In two studies, researchers tried to improve care that was already directed at changes at work but did not find any effects of these improvements on sick leave. Effects of psychological treatment In three studies with 326 participants, researchers found that cognitive behavioural therapy that was provided online or by telephone reduced sickness absence to a moderate extent compared to regular care. In one high quality study, a special care programme carried out via the workplace also reduced sick leave when compared to regular care. Effects of antidepressant pills Three studies compared antidepressant pills with each other but there were no consistent effects on sickness absence. Improving primary care Improving primary care through quality improvement programs for general practitioners did not reduce sickness absence in three studies. Exercise One study found that participants had a reduction in sick leave after doing stretching exercises. Two other studies did not find an effect on sick leave after physical exercises such as running or using the gymnasium. More studies should look at the effects of changes at work. Regular clinical studies should also measure the effects on sick leave because this is an important consequence of depression.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication is used extensively to treat people with chronic mental illnesses. Its use, however, is associated with adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) – a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements around the mouth and face. Vitamin E has been proposed as a treatment to prevent or decrease TD. Objectives The primary objective was to determine the clinical effects of vitamin E in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness who had developed antipsychotic‐induced TD. The secondary objectives were:  1. to examine whether the effect of vitamin E was maintained as duration of follow‐up increased;  2. to test the hypothesis that the use of vitamin E is most effective for those with early onset TD (less than five years) Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports if they were controlled trials dealing with people with antipsychotic‐induced TD and schizophrenia who remained on their antipsychotic medication and had been randomly allocated to either vitamin E or to a placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The review now includes 13 poorly reported randomised trials (total 478 people), all participants were adults with chronic psychiatric disorders, mostly schizophrenia, and antipsychotic‐induced TD. There was no clear difference between vitamin E and placebo for the outcome of TD: not improved to a clinically important extent (6 RCTs, N = 264, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01, low‐quality evidence). However, people allocated to placebo may show more deterioration of their symptoms compared with those given vitamin E (5 RCTs, N = 85, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76, low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of any adverse effects (9 RCTs, N = 205, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.15,  v ery low‐quality evidence), extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, N = 104, MD 1.10, 95% CI ‐1.02 to 3.22, very low‐quality evidence), or acceptability of treatment (measured by participants leaving the study early) (medium term, 8 RCTs, N = 232, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.80, very low‐quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, outcomes designated important to patients. There is no trial‐based information regarding the effect of vitamin E for those with early onset of TD. Authors' conclusions Small trials of limited quality suggest that vitamin E may protect against deterioration of TD. There is no evidence that vitamin E improves symptoms of this problematic and disfiguring condition once established. New and better trials are indicated in this under‐researched area, and, of the many adjunctive treatments that have been given for TD, vitamin E would be a good choice for further evaluation. Plain language summary Vitamin E for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question Is vitamin E useful for treating an unpleasant side effect of taking antipsychotics ‐ tardive dyskinesia ‐ in people with schizophrenia or other similar mental illnesses? Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high‐dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. Vitamin E has been suggested as a treatment, but so far the benefit of using Vitamin E for this purpose seems small. Study characteristics We searched for trials, July 2015 and April 2017, using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials. The review includes 13 poorly reported randomised trials investigating the effects of vitamin E for people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who also developed TD as a result of taking antipsychotics. The trials randomised a total of 478 participants who had been ill for a long time. Key results Vitamin E may protect against tardive dyskinesia. However, there is no clear evidence that vitamin E improves this problematic and disfiguring condition. Quality of the evidence Available evidence is weak, limited and poor and we are unable to make any conclusions regarding the use of Vitamin E for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Well‐designed trials involving a large number of participants investigating the effects of vitamin E over long periods of time are needed to determine whether this vitamin provides an effective treatment option for tardive dyskinesia.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia and related disorders such as schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder are serious mental illnesses characterised by profound disruptions in thinking and speech, emotional processes, behaviour and sense of self. Clozapine is useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders, particularly when other antipsychotic medications have failed. It improves positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (such as withdrawal and poverty of speech). However, it is unclear what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects. Objectives To compare the efficacy and tolerability of clozapine at different doses and to identify the optimal dose of clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (August 2011 and 8 December 2016). Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding status or language, that compared the effects of clozapine at different doses in people with schizophrenia and related disorders, diagnosed by any criteria. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations from the searches, identified relevant abstracts, obtained full articles of relevant abstracts, and classified trials as included or excluded. We included trials that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We identified five studies that could be included. Each compared the effects of clozapine at very low dose (up to 149 mg/day), low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) and standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day). Four of the five included studies were based on a small number of participants. We rated all the evidence reported for the main outcomes of interest as low or very low quality. No data were available for the main outcomes of global state, service use or quality of life. Very low dose compared to low dose We found no evidence of effect on mental state between low and very low doses of clozapine in terms of average Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale‐Anchored (BPRS‐A) endpoint score (1 RCT, n = 31, MD 3.55, 95% CI −4.50 to 11.60, very low quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups in body mass index (BMI) in the short term (1 RCT, n = 59, MD −0.10, 95% CI −0.95 to 0.75, low‐quality evidence). Very low dose compared to standard dose We found no evidence of effect on mental state between very low doses and standard doses of clozapine in terms of average BPRS‐A endpoint score (1 RCT, n = 31, MD 6.67, 95% CI −2.09 to 15.43, very low quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups in BMI in the short term (1 RCT, n = 58, MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.76 to 0.96, low‐quality evidence) Low dose compared to standard dose We found no evidence of effect on mental state between low doses and standard doses of clozapine in terms of both clinician‐assessed clinical improvement (2 RCTs, n = 141, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.61, medium‐quality evidence) and clinically important response as more than 30% change in BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 176, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10, medium‐quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups in BMI in the short term (1 RCT, n = 57, MD 0.20, 95% CI −0.84 to 1.24, low‐quality evidence). We found some evidence of effect for other adverse effect outcomes; however, the data were again limited. Very low dose compared to low dose There was limited evidence that serum triglycerides were lower at low‐dose clozapine compared to very low dose in the short term (1 RCT, n = 59, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.49). Low dose compared to standard dose Weight gain was lower at very low dose compared to standard dose (1 RCT, n = 27, MD −2.70, 95% CI −5.38 to −0.02). Glucose level one hour after meal was also lower at very lose dose (1 RCT, n = 58, MD −1.60, 95% CI −2.90 to −0.30). Total cholesterol levels were higher at very low compared to standard dose (1 RCT, n = 58, n = 58, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.80). Low dose compared to standard dose There was evidence of fewer adverse effects, measured as lower TESS scores, in the low‐dose group in the short term (2 RCTs, n = 266, MD −3.99, 95% CI −5.75 to −2.24); and in one study there was evidence that the incidence of lethargy (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97), hypersalivation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84), dizziness (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81) and tachycardia (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71) was less at low dose compared to standard dose. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of effect on mental state between standard, low and very low dose regimes, but we did not identify any trials on high or very high doses of clozapine. BMI measurements were similar between groups in the short term, although weight gain was less at very low dose compared to standard dose in one study. There was limited evidence that the incidence of some adverse effects was greater at standard dose compared to lower dose regimes. We found very little useful data and the evidence available is generally of low or very low quality. More studies are needed to validate our findings and report on outcomes such as relapse, remission, social functioning, service utilisation, cost‐effectiveness, satisfaction with care, and quality of life. There is a particular lack of medium‐ or long‐term outcome data, and on dose regimes above the standard rate. Plain language summary Clozapine dose in schizophrenia Background:  Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects thinking and perception. People with schizophrenia often experience profound disruptions in their speech, emotional processes, behaviour and sense of self. Antipsychotic medication can be a helpful treatment for schizophrenia; however, taking antipsychotic medication can have unpleasant effects. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug that can be useful in treating schizophrenia, particularly when other antipsychotic medications have not worked. It is unclear, however, what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects. This review investigates the effects of receiving clozapine at four different dose levels (high dose, standard dose, low dose, very low dose). Searching:  An electronic search for studies that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive different doses of clozapine was run in August 2011 and again on 8 December 2016. Results : We found five studies with 452 participants which met our inclusion criteria. Each compared the effects of clozapine at very low dose (up to 149 mg/day), low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) and standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day). None of the studies examined the effects of clozapine at higher than the standard dose. There was nothing to choose between standard, low and very low doses in terms of body mass index (BMI) measurements in the short term. However, weight gain was greater in those receiving the standard dose compared to those receiving the low dose. The incidence of unpleasant side effects (which included feeling lethargic, producing too much saliva, and feeling dizzy) was less at low dose compared to standard dose. Quality of evidence:  For main outcomes the quality was low or very low. Conclusions:  We found no evidence that might indicate the best dose of clozapine for patients with schizophrenia. Careful consideration has to be given to balancing the advantages and disadvantages of different doses in relation to weight gain and other side effects. Overall measurements of BMI were similar between groups; however, some side effects appear to be lower at lower doses. Overall, this review highlights the lack of evidence‐based information available for addressing the question of what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects. There is a need for large, well‐designed and well‐reported randomised clinical trials to address this question. There is a particular need for such trials to look at longer‐term outcomes, and to examine the effects of clozapine when given at greater than the standard dose.

AB: Abstract - Background People with schizophrenia from families that express high levels of criticism, hostility, or over involvement, have more frequent relapses than people with similar problems from families that tend to be less expressive of emotions. Forms of psychosocial intervention, designed to reduce these levels of expressed emotions within families, are now widely used. Objectives To estimate the effects of family psychosocial interventions in community settings for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like conditions compared with standard care. Search methods We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (September 2008). Selection criteria We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised studies focusing primarily on families of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that compared community‐orientated family‐based psychosocial intervention with standard care. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and calculated fixed‐effect relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary data, and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). Main results This 2009‐10 update adds 21 additional studies, with a total of 53 randomised controlled trials included. Family intervention may decrease the frequency of relapse (n = 2981, 32 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.5 to 0.6, NNT 7 CI 6 to 8), although some small but negative studies might not have been identified by the search. Family intervention may also reduce hospital admission (n = 481, 8 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.6 to 1.0, NNT 8 CI 6 to 13) and encourage compliance with medication (n = 695, 10 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 6 CI 5 to 9) but it does not obviously affect the tendency of individuals/families to leave care (n = 733, 10 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.5 to 1.0). Family intervention also seems to improve general social impairment and the levels of expressed emotion within the family. We did not find data to suggest that family intervention either prevents or promotes suicide. Authors' conclusions Family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers. However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. Further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation, test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings. Plain language summary Family intervention for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia are more likely to experience a relapse within family groups when there are high levels of expressed emotion (hostility, criticism or over involvement) within the family, compared to families who tend to be less expressive of their emotions. There are several psychosocial interventions available involving education, support and management to reduce expressed emotion within families. In this review we compare the effects of family psychosocial interventions in community settings for the care of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses.     Studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and North America with packages of family intervention varying among studies, although there were no clear differences in study design. Results indicated that family intervention may reduce the risk of relapse and improve compliance with medication. However data were often inadequately reported and therefore unusable. As this package of care is widely employed, there should be further research to properly clarify several of the short‐term and long‐term outcomes.

AB: Abstract - Background People with dementia who are being cared for in long‐term care settings are often not engaged in meaningful activities. Offering them activities which are tailored to their individual interests and preferences might improve their quality of life and reduce challenging behaviour. Objectives ∙ To assess the effects of personally tailored activities on psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia living in long‐term care facilities. ∙ To describe the components of the interventions. ∙ To describe conditions which enhance the effectiveness of personally tailored activities in this setting. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register, on 16 June 2017 using the terms: personally tailored OR individualized OR individualised OR individual OR person‐centred OR meaningful OR personhood OR involvement OR engagement OR engaging OR identity. We also performed additional searches in MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP, to ensure that the search for the review was as up to date and as comprehensive as possible. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials offering personally tailored activities. All interventions included an assessment of the participants' present or past preferences for, or interests in, particular activities as a basis for an individual activity plan. Control groups received either usual care or an active control intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently checked the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. For all studies, we assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. In case of missing information, we contacted the study authors. Main results We included eight studies with 957 participants. The mean age of participants in the studies ranged from 78 to 88 years and in seven studies the mean MMSE score was 12 or lower. Seven studies were randomised controlled trials (three individually randomised, parallel group studies, one individually randomised cross‐over study and three cluster‐randomised trials) and one study was a non‐randomised clinical trial. Five studies included a control group receiving usual care, two studies an active control intervention (activities which were not personally tailored) and one study included both an active control and usual care. Personally tailored activities were mainly delivered directly to the participants; in one study the nursing staff were trained to deliver the activities. The selection of activities was based on different theoretical models but the activities did not vary substantially. We found low‐quality evidence indicating that personally tailored activities may slightly improve challenging behaviour (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.49 to 0.08; I² = 50%; 6 studies; 439 participants). We also found low‐quality evidence from one study that was not included in the meta‐analysis, indicating that personally tailored activities may make little or no difference to general restlessness, aggression, uncooperative behaviour, very negative and negative verbal behaviour (180 participants). There was very little evidence related to our other primary outcome of quality of life, which was assessed in only one study. From this study, we found that quality of life rated by proxies was slightly worse in the group receiving personally tailored activities (moderate‐quality evidence, mean difference (MD) −1.93, 95% CI −3.63 to −0.23; 139 participants). Self‐rated quality of life was only available for a small number of participants, and there was little or no difference between personally tailored activities and usual care on this outcome (low‐quality evidence, MD 0.26, 95% CI −3.04 to 3.56; 42 participants). We found low‐quality evidence that personally tailored activities may make little or no difference to negative affect (SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.14; I² = 0%; 6 studies; 589 participants). We found very low quality evidence and are therefore very uncertain whether personally tailored activities have any effect on positive affect (SMD 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; I² = 80%; 6 studies; 498 participants); or mood (SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.27 to 0.23; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 247 participants). We were not able to undertake a meta‐analysis for engagement and the sleep‐related outcomes. We found very low quality evidence and are therefore very uncertain whether personally tailored activities improve engagement or sleep‐related outcomes (176 and 139 participants, respectively). Two studies that investigated the duration of the effects of personally tailored activities indicated that the intervention effects persisted only during the delivery of the activities. Two studies reported information about adverse effects and no adverse effects were observed. Authors' conclusions Offering personally tailored activities to people with dementia in long‐term care may slightly improve challenging behaviour. Evidence from one study suggested that it was probably associated with a slight reduction in the quality of life rated by proxies, but may have little or no effect on self‐rated quality of life. We acknowledge concerns about the validity of proxy ratings of quality of life in severe dementia. Personally tailored activities may have little or no effect on negative affect and we are uncertain whether they improve positive affect or mood. There was no evidence that interventions were more likely to be effective if based on one specific theoretical model rather than another. Our findings leave us unable to make recommendations about specific activities or the frequency and duration of delivery. Further research should focus on methods for selecting appropriate and meaningful activities for people in different stages of dementia. Plain language summary Personally tailored activities for people with dementia in long‐term care Background People with dementia living in nursing or residential homes often have too little to do. Activities which are available may not be meaningful to them. If a person with dementia has the chance to take part in activities which match his or her personal interests and preferences, this may lead to a better quality of life, may reduce challenging behaviour such as restlessness or aggression, and may have other positive effects. Purpose of this review We wanted to investigate the effects of offering people with dementia who were living in care homes activities tailored to their personal interests. Studies included in the review In June 2017 we searched for trials that had offered some participants an activity programme based on their individual interests (an intervention group) and had compared them with other participants who were not offered these activities (a control group). We found eight studies including 957 people with dementia living in care homes. Seven of the studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), meaning that it was decided at random whether participants were in the intervention group or the control group. One study was not randomised, which puts it at higher risk of biased results. The number of participants included in the studies ranged from 25 to 180. They all had moderate or severe dementia and almost all had some kind of challenging behaviour when the study started. The studies lasted from 10 days to nine months. In all the studies, the people in the intervention groups got an individual activity plan. Most of the activities took place in special sessions run by trained staff, but in one study, the nursing staff were trained to provide the activities during the daily care routine. The activities actually offered in the different studies did not vary a lot, but the number of activity sessions per week and the duration of the sessions did vary. In five studies, the control group got only the usual care delivered in care homes; in three studies, the control group got different activities that were not personally tailored; one study had both types of control group. The quality of the trials and how well they were reported varied, and this affected our confidence in the results. Key findings Offering personally tailored activities to people with dementia living in care homes may slightly improve challenging behaviour when compared with usual care, although we did not find evidence that it was any better than offering activities which were not personally tailored. In one study, staff members reported that people in the group receiving personally tailored activities had a slightly worse quality of life than the control group. Personally tailored activities may have little or no effect on the negative emotions expressed by the participants. Because the quality of some of the evidence was very low, we could not draw any conclusions about effects on the participants' positive emotions, mood, engagement (being involved in what is happening around them) or quality of sleep. Only two studies mentioned looking for harmful effects; none were reported. None of the studies measured effects on the amount of medication participants were given, or effects on carers. Conclusions We concluded that offering activity sessions to people with moderate or severe dementia living in care homes may help to manage challenging behaviour. However, we did not find any evidence to support the idea that activities were more effective if they were tailored to people's individual interests. More research of better quality is needed before we can be certain about the effects of personally tailored activities.

AB: Abstract - Background Weight loss, malnutrition and dehydration are common problems for people with dementia. Environmental modifications such as, change of routine, context or ambience at mealtimes, or behavioural modifications, such as education or training of people with dementia or caregivers, may be considered to try to improve food and fluid intake and nutritional status of people with dementia. Objectives Primary: To assess the effects of environmental or behavioural modifications on food and fluid intake and nutritional status in people with dementia. Secondary: To assess the effects of environmental or behavioural modifications in connection with nutrition on mealtime behaviour, cognitive and functional outcomes and quality of life, in specific settings (i.e. home care, residential care and nursing home care) for different stages of dementia. To assess the adverse consequences or effects of the included interventions. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement (ALOIS), MEDLINE, Eembase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 17 January 2018. We scanned reference lists of other reviews and of included articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating interventions designed to modify the mealtime environment of people with dementia, to modify the mealtime behaviour of people with dementia or their caregivers, or both, with the intention of improving food and fluid intake. We included people with any common dementia subtype. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included trials. We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included nine studies, investigating 1502 people. Three studies explicitly investigated participants with Alzheimer's disease; six did not specify the type of dementia. Five studies provided clear measures to identify the severity of dementia at baseline, and overall very mild to severe stages were covered. The interventions and outcome measures were diverse. The overall quality of evidence was mainly low to very low. One study implemented environmental as well as behavioural modifications by providing additional food items between meals and personal encouragement to consume them. The control group received no intervention. Differences between groups were very small and the quality of the evidence from this study was very low, so we are very uncertain of any effect of this intervention. The remaining eight studies implemented behavioural modifications. Three studies provided nutritional education and nutrition promotion programmes. Control groups did not receive these programmes. After 12 months, the intervention group showed slightly higher protein intake per day (mean difference (MD) 0.11 g/kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.01 to 0.23; n = 78, 1 study; low‐quality evidence), but there was no clear evidence of a difference in nutritional status assessed with body mass index (BMI) (MD ‐0.26 kg/m² favouring control, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.19; n = 734, 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence), body weight (MD ‐1.60 kg favouring control, 95% CI ‐3.47 to 0.27; n = 656, 1 study; moderate‐quality evidence), or score on Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) (MD ‐0.10 favouring control, 95% CI ‐0.67 to 0.47; n = 656, 1 study; low‐quality evidence). After six months, the intervention group in one study had slightly lower BMI (MD ‐1.79 kg/m² favouring control, 95% CI ‐1.28 to ‐2.30; n = 52, 1 study; moderate‐quality evidence) and body weight (MD ‐8.11 kg favouring control, 95% CI ‐2.06 to ‐12.56; n = 52, 1 study; moderate‐quality evidence). This type of intervention may have a small positive effect on food intake, but little or no effect, or a negative effect, on nutritional status. Two studies compared self‐feeding skills training programmes. In one study, the control group received no training and in the other study the control group received a different self‐feeding skills training programme. For both comparisons the quality of the evidence was very low and we are very uncertain whether these interventions have any effect. One study investigated general training of nurses to impart knowledge on how to feed people with dementia and improve attitudes towards people with dementia. Again, the quality of the evidence was very low so that we cannot be certain of any effect. Two studies investigated vocal or tactile positive feedback provided by caregivers while feeding participants. After three weeks, the intervention group showed an increase in calories consumed per meal (MD 200 kcal, 95% CI 119.81 to 280.19; n = 42, 1 study; low‐quality evidence) and protein consumed per meal (MD 15g, 95% CI 7.74 to 22.26; n = 42, 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This intervention may increase the intake of food and liquids slightly; nutritional status was not assessed. Authors' conclusions Due to the quantity and quality of the evidence currently available, we cannot identify any specific environmental or behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia. Plain language summary Environmental and behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia What we wanted to know Weight loss, malnutrition and dehydration are common problems for people with dementia and can occur at any stage of the illness. People with dementia often develop psychological symptoms or behaviours which cause them to eat or drink less. In the later stages of the illness, they become dependent on others to help them eat or drink. We wanted to investigate how to keep people with dementia eating and drinking as well as possible. We looked for studies which changed the way food and drink are presented to people with dementia, and for studies which attempted to change the behaviour of people with dementia or of those helping them to eat. We called these environmental and behavioural modifications respectively, though some interventions include aspects of both. We were mainly interested in the effect on how much people with dementia ate and drank and on measures of how well‐nourished they were (e.g. body weight or body mass index (BMI)), but we also looked for effects on eating behaviour, symptoms of dementia and quality of life. How we tried to answer the question We searched for all the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which were relevant to our question. In these trials, some people with dementia got an environmental or behavioural modification intended to improve their eating and drinking and were then compared with other people who had not had the intervention (the control group). Whether someone got the intervention or not was decided at random. We found nine RCTs to include in our review. In total, there were 1502 people in these trials. They had varying degrees of dementia, probably mostly due to Alzheimer's disease. Seven of the trials took place in care homes. In one trial, people were given extra snacks between meals and encouraged to eat them. In three trials, people with dementia were given education about diet and eating. In two trials, people with dementia were taught skills to help them to eat independently. In three trials, training was given to the carers responsible for helping people with dementia to eat. What we found out All the trials we found tested different interventions and measured their effects in different ways. Generally, the trials were small and there were problems with the way they were done, which reduced our confidence in the results. For some interventions, the quality of the evidence was so low that we could not draw any conclusions. For others, there was a mixture of positive and negative effects. What we concluded Because of the amount and quality of the evidence we found, we cannot at the moment, identify any specific environmental or behavioural modifications for improving food and fluid intake in people with dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disabling movement disorder associated with the prolonged use of antipsychotic medication. Several strategies have been examined in the treatment of TD. Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of these drugs in TD and they have been associated with many side effects. One particular strategy would be to use pharmaceutical agents which are known to influence the catecholaminergic system at various junctures. Objectives 1. To determine the effects of any of the following drugs for antipsychotic‐induced TD in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses.  i. Drugs which influence the noradrenergic system.  ii. Dopamine receptor agonists.  iii. Dopamine receptor antagonists.  iv. Dopamine‐depletor drugs.  v. Drugs that increase the production or release of dopamine. 2. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than 6 weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow‐up. 3. To examine if there was a differential effect for the various compounds. 4. To examine whether the use of non‐antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs are most effective in those with more recent onset TD (less than five years). Search methods We retrieved 712 references from searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017). We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We selected studies if they were randomised controlled trials focusing on people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses and antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. We compared the use of catecholaminergic interventions versus placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left the studies early had no improvement. Main results There are 10 included trials (N = 261) published between 1973 and 2010; eight are new from the 2015 and 2017 update searches. Forty‐eight studies are excluded. Participants were mostly chronically mentally ill inpatients in their 50s, and studies were primarily of short (2 to 6 weeks) duration. The overall risk of bias in these studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and generation of the sequence. Studies were also not clearly blinded and we are unsure if data are incomplete or selectively reported, or if other biases were operating. One small, three‐arm trial found that both alpha‐methyldopa (N = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80;  low‐quality evidence ) and reserpine (N = 20; RR 0.52 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96;  low‐quality evidence ) may lead to a clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared with placebo after 2 weeks' treatment, but found no evidence of a difference between alpha‐methyldopa and reserpine (N = 20; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.86;  very low quality evidence ). Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks' treatment and found no evidence of a difference on clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms (N = 13; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.95;  very low quality evidence ). No study reported on adverse events. For remaining outcomes there was no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions: alpha‐methyldopa versus placebo for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32;  very low quality evidence ), celiprolol versus placebo for leaving the study early (1 RCT; N = 35; RR 5.28, 95% CI 0.27 to 102.58;  very low quality evidence ) and quality of life (1 RCT; N = 35; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.12;  very low quality evidence ), alpha‐methyldopa versus reserpine for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 20; not estimable, no reported events;  very low quality evidence ), reserpine or carbidopa/levodopa versus placebo for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (2 RCTs; N = 37; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.99;  very low quality evidence ), oxypertine versus placebo for deterioration of mental state (1 RCT; N = 42; RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.22 to 22.45;  very low quality evidence ), dopaminergic drugs (amantadine, bromocriptine, tiapride, oxypertine, carbidopa/levodopa) versus placebo for leaving the study early (6 RCTs; N = 163; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.54;  very low quality evidence ), and tetrabenazine versus haloperidol for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 13; RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 14.92) and leaving the study early (1 RCT; N = 13; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00). Authors' conclusions Although there has been a large amount of research in this area, many studies were excluded due to inherent problems in the nature of their cross‐over designs. Usually data are not reported before the cross‐over and the nature of TD and its likely response to treatments make it imprudent to use this data. The review provides little usable information for service users or providers and more well‐designed and well‐reported studies are indicated. Plain language summary Non‐antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question . To determine if catecholaminergic drugs help in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia for people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Background . People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side‐effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high‐dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. One suggested treatment is to use medication that affects the catecholaminergic system, which is a group of brain chemicals. Study characteristics . The review includes 10 small, short studies published mainly in the 1980s involving a total of 261 people. Key results . One small study found that after 2 weeks' treatment both alpha‐methyldopa and reserpine may lead to clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared with placebo, but the quality of evidence was low. We are uncertain about the effect of reserpine versus alpha‐methyldopa; quality of evidence was very low. Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks' treatment, but again we are uncertain about the effect as the quality of evidence was very low. The included studies did not report on any harmful effects of the drugs. Quality of the evidence . Evidence is weak, limited, short term, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia and their use is entirely experimental. There is a need for larger and more rigorous research in the area. This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation ( mcpin.org/ ).

AB: Abstract - Background Many individuals who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience a range of distressing and debilitating symptoms. These can include positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech), cognitive symptoms (such as trouble focusing or paying attention or using information to make decisions), and negative symptoms (such as diminished emotional expression, avolition, alogia, and anhedonia). Antipsychotic drugs are often only partially effective, particularly in treating negative symptoms, indicating the need for additional treatment. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant drug that when taken in addition to an antipsychotic may offer some benefit for negative symptoms. Objectives To systematically assess the effects of mirtazapine as adjunct treatment for people with schizophrenia. Search methods The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) up to May 2018. Selection criteria All randomised‐controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data focusing on mirtazapine adjunct for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. For included studies we assessed risk of bias and created 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We included nine RCTs with a total of 310 participants. All studies compared mirtazapine adjunct with placebo adjunct and were of short‐term duration. We considered five studies to have a high risk of bias for either incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, or other bias. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in mental state (negative and positive symptoms), leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in global state, clinically important change in quality of life, number of days in hospital and incidence of serious adverse events. One trial defined a reduction in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) overall score from baseline of at least 20% as no important response for negative symptoms. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the two treatments with similar numbers of participants from each group showing no important response to treatment (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14, 1 RCT, n = 20, very low‐quality evidence). Clinically important change in positive symptoms was not reported, however, clinically important change in overall mental state was reported by two trials and data for this outcome showed a favourable effect for mirtazapine (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92; I 2  = 75%, 2 RCTs, n = 77, very low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear difference for numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.66, 9 RCTs, n = 310, moderate‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a clear difference in global state Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) severity scores (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.48, 1 RCT, n = 39, very low‐quality evidence). A favourable effect for mirtazapine adjunct was found for the outcome clinically important change in akathisia (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.52, 2 RCTs, n = 86, low‐quality evidence; I 2  = 61%I). No data were reported for quality life or number of days in hospital. In addition to the main outcomes of interest, there was evidence relating to adverse events that the mirtazapine adjunct groups were associated with an increased risk of weight gain (RR 3.19, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.65, 4 RCTs, n = 127) and sedation/drowsiness (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.68, 7 RCTs, n = 223). Authors' conclusions The available evidence is primarily of very low quality and indicates that mirtazapine adjunct is not clearly associated with an effect for negative symptoms, but there is some indication of a positive effect on overall mental state and akathisia. No effect was found for global state or leaving the study early and data were not available for quality of life or service use. Due to limitations of the quality and applicability of the evidence it is not possible to make any firm conclusions, the role of mirtazapine adjunct in routine clinical practice remains unclear. This underscores the need for new high‐quality evidence to further evaluate mirtazapine adjunct for schizophrenia. Plain language summary Mirtazapine as an add‐on treatment for schizophrenia Review question Is adding mirtazapine, an antidepressant medication, to standard care an effective and safe treatment for people with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness. Those affected typically exhibit abnormal social behaviour and an inability to judge what is real. There are three main types of symptoms. Positive symptoms are where patients hear voices or see things that are not there and can also have fixed false beliefs (delusions). Examples of negative symptoms are lack of motivation and withdrawal from social activities. Cognitive symptoms include a reduced ability to concentrate or difficulty in using information to make decisions. Schizophrena can be extremely debilitating, greatly affecting a person's social functioning and their ability to live independently. Antipsychotic medications are the main treatment for schizophrenia and are effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia but often do not fully treat the negative symptoms. Additional treatments (adjuncts) are often used alongside antipsychotics to help treat the negative symptoms. Antidepressant medications, such as mirtazapine, can be used as adjunct treatment. Mirtazapine may have the potential to improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but also has the potential to cause unpleasant side effects. Evidence summarising mirtazapine's benefits and harms for people with schizophrenia is needed. Searching The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their specialised register for clinical trials that randomly allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either mirtazapine or another treatment in addition their standard care. The latest search was in May 2018 and we found a total of 35 references to potential trials. We carefully inspected the full‐text articles of these references for inclusion or exclusion from this review. Results Nine randomised controlled trials met the review requirements and provided useable data. The participants in the studies received either mirtazapine plus their standard care or their standard care plus a placebo. Results showed adding mirtazapine to standard treatment may slightly improve overall mental state but does not appear to specifically have a clinically important effect on negative symptoms. Adding mirtazapine to standard care may slightly improve the symptoms akathisia, a side effect of antipsychotics where a person is very restless and unable to keep still. No effect was found for global state or leaving the study early and data were not available for quality of life or hospital admission. In addition, some results showed mirtazapine was associated with a higher risk of weight gain and sedation. However, these results are based on evidence that is mainly very ‐ow quality. Conclusions Mirtazapine may have some positive effects for people with schizophrenia. However, these results are mainly based on very low‐quality evidence and we are uncertain about these effects. Firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of mirtazapine as an add on treatment for people with schizophrenia can not be made without more high‐quality research.

AB: Abstract - Background The use of enteral tube feeding for patients with advanced dementia who have poor nutritional intake is common. In one US survey 34% of 186,835 nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment were tube fed. Potential benefits or harms of this practice are unclear. Objectives To evaluate the outcome of enteral tube nutrition for older people with advanced dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing and/or have poor nutritional intake. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched in April 2008. Citation checking was undertaken. Where it was not possible to accept or reject, the full text of the citation was obtained for further evaluation. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies that evaluated the effectiveness of enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube or via a tube passed by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were planned to be included. In addition, controlled observational studies were included. The study population comprised adults aged 50 and over (either sex), with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia made according to validated diagnostic criteria such as DSM‐IV or ICD‐10 (APA 1994; WHO 1993) and with advanced cognitive impairment defined by a recognised and validated tool or by clinical assessment and had poor nutrition intake and/or develop problems with eating and swallowing. Where data were limited we also considered studies in which the majority of participants had dementia. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted and assessed by one reviewer, checked by a second and if necessary, in the case of any disagreement or discrepancy it was planned that it would be reviewed by the third reviewer. Where information was lacking, we attempted contact with authors. It was planned that meta‐analysis would be considered for RCTs with comparable key characteristics. The primary outcomes were survival and quality of life (QoL). Main results No RCTs were identified. Seven observational controlled studies were identified. Six assessed mortality. The other study assessed nutritional outcomes. There was no evidence of increased survival in patients receiving enteral tube feeding. None of the studies examined QoL and there was no evidence of benefit in terms of nutritional status or the prevalence of pressure ulcers. Authors' conclusions Despite the very large number of patients receiving this intervention, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that enteral tube feeding is beneficial in patients with advanced dementia. Data are lacking on the adverse effects of this intervention. Plain language summary There is insufficient evidence to suggest that enteral tube feeding is beneficial in patients with advanced dementia. Data are lacking on the adverse effects of this intervention Patients with advanced dementia often develop dysphagia (difficulties swallowing). They also experience changes in appetite and apraxia (difficulty co‐coordinating movements) and may have difficulties feeding themselves. Two methods of enteral tube feeding are commonly used: the administration of food and fluids via a nasogastric tube (a tube that is passed through the nose and into the stomach) or via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) where a feeding tube is inserted into the stomach and is accessed through a permanent incision in the abdominal wall. The decision to use artificial hydration and nutrition in someone with dementia is often emotive and complex. Relatives and carers may request the intervention because they are concerned that the patient may starve; clinicians may be aware of the risks but feel pressurised by institutional, societal or even legal directives to intervene. We found no conclusive evidence that enteral tube nutrition is effective in terms of prolonging survival, improving quality of life, or leading to better nourishment or decreasing the risk of pressure sores. It may actually increase the risk of developing pneumonia due to inhaling small quantities of the feed and even death.  This area is difficult to research but better designed studies are required to provide more robust evidence.

AB: Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. Selection criteria We included double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow‐up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta‐analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non‐fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). Authors' conclusions There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only. Plain language summary Statins for the prevention of dementia Background Dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol‐lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. Key results We found two suitable randomised trials for inclusion in this review with 26,340 participants; neither showed any reduction in occurrence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in people treated with statins compared to people given placebo. Side effects were low in both statin and placebo groups with no difference between groups in the risk of dropping out of the trial due to side effects. Quality of the evidence There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Micronutrient status can affect cognitive function at all ages. Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age‐associated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6, comprising three chemically distinct compounds, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine, is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood. Vitamin B6 is also an essential homocysteine re‐methylation cofactor, and deficiency is associated with an increase in blood homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and may also have directly toxic effects on neurons of the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric disorders including seizures, migraine, chronic pain and depression have been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Epidemiological studies indicate that poor vitamin B6 status is common among older people. Hyperhomocysteinaemia has been suggested as a cause or mechanism in the development Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Supplementation with B vitamins including vitamin B6 has been shown to reduce blood homocysteine levels. Objectives To assess the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation in reducing the risk of developing cognitive impairment by older healthy people, or improving cognitive functioning of people with cognitive decline and dementia, whether or not vitamin B6 deficiency has been diagnosed. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 16 March 2008 using the terms: B6, "B 6", B‐6, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All unconfounded, double‐blind randomized controlled trials in which the intervention with vitamin B6 was compared with placebo for healthy older people or people with cognitive decline or dementia. The primary outcome of interest was the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation on cognitive function. Data collection and analysis The two reviewers independently evaluated all studies identified as possibly meeting the criteria for inclusion. One reviewer independently extracted the data. Studies were rated for their overall quality. The weighted mean differences between treatment and placebo groups, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for each outcome. Review Manager version 4.2 was used to analyse the variance. Main results No trials of vitamin B6 involving people with cognitive impairment or dementia were found. The two trials included in the review (Bryan 2002; Deijen 1992) used a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled design and involved 109 healthy older people. One trial restricted enrolment to women and the other to men. Vitamin B6 supplementation and healthy older women: Bryan 2002, enrolled 211 healthy women from various age groups into a five‐week study. The trial was of multifactorial design with folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and placebo in its four arms. Twelve healthy women aged 65 to 92 years received 75 mg vitamin B6 orally per day and were compared with 21 healthy women who were allocated to placebo. No statistically significant benefits from vitamin B6 on mood or cognition were observed. Vitamin B6 supplementation and healthy older men: Deijen 1992, recruited 76 healthy men aged 70 to 79 years. They were divided into 38 matched pairs, one member of each pair randomly allocated to 20 mg of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) per day for 12 weeks the other to placebo. No statistically significant differences between treatment and placebo were found in their effects on cognition or mood. Effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on vitamin B6 status: Deijen 1992, reported that 20 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride per day for 12 weeks increased blood vitamin B6 activity as assessed as by plasma pyridoxal‐5'‐phosphate (WMD 238, 95%CI 211.58 to 264.42, P<0.00001) and erythrocyte enzyme asparate aminotransferase (WMD 0.43, 95%CI 0.30 to 0.56, P<0.00001) Effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on blood homocysteine concentration: Neither of the included trials measured homocysteine levels. Drop‐outs: All participants allocated to vitamin B6 or placebo completed the trial protocol. Adverse events: No adverse effects were reported. Effect of vitamin B6 on carer burden, care costs and institutionalization rate: We found no trials in which these outcomes were assessed. Authors' conclusions This review found no evidence for short‐term benefit from vitamin B6 in improving mood (depression, fatigue and tension symptoms) or cognitive functions. For the older people included in one of the two trials included in the review, oral vitamin B6 supplements improved biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status, but potential effects on blood homocysteine levels were not assessed in either study. This review found evidence that there is scope for increasing some biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status among older people. More randomized controlled trials are needed to explore possible benefits from vitamin B6 supplementation for healthy older people and for those with cognitive impairment or dementia. Plain language summary No evidence of benefit from vitamin B6 supplementation on mood or cognition of older people with normal vitamin B6 status or with vitamin B6 deficiency Micronutrient status can affect cognitive function at all ages. Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age‐associated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6 is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood and in the metabolism of homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Two trials of vitamin B6 supplements for healthy elderly people qualified for this review, with no beneficial effects on mood or mental function detectable. Homocysteine levels were not assessed. No ill effects of vitamin B6 were observed. No trials studying effects of vitamin B6 treatment for people with dementia or cognitive impairment were identified.

AB: Abstract - Background As estrogens have been shown to have several potentially beneficial effects on the central nervous system, it is biologically plausible that maintaining high levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women by means of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) could be protective against cognitive decline in women with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementia syndromes. Objectives To investigate the effects of ERT (estrogens only) or HRT (estrogens combined with a progestagen) compared with placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cognitive function of postmenopausal women with dementia. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, which contains records from many medical databases,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS were searched on 7 November 2007 using the terms ORT, PORT, ERT, HRT, estrogen*, oestrogen* and progesterone*. Selection criteria All double‐blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into the effect of ERT or HRT for cognitive function with a treatment period of at least two weeks in postmenopausal women with AD or other types of dementia. Data collection and analysis Abstracts of the references retrieved by the searches were read by two reviewers (EH and KY) independently in order to discard those that were clearly not eligible for inclusion. The two reviewers studied the full text of the remaining references and independently selected studies for inclusion. Any disparity in the ensuing lists was resolved by discussion with all reviewers in order to arrive at the final list of included studies. The selection criteria ensured that the blinding and randomization of the included studies was adequate. The two reviewers also assessed the quality of other aspects of the included trials. One reviewer (EH) extracted the data from the studies, but was aided and checked by JB from Cochrane. Main results A total of seven trials including 351 women with AD were analysed. Because different drugs were used at different studies it was not possible to combine more than two studies in any analysis. On a clinical global rating, clinicians scored patients taking CEE as significantly worse compared with the placebo group on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale after 12 months (overall WMD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.69, z = 1.99, P < 0.05). Patients taking CEE had a worse performance on the delayed recall of the Paragraph Test (overall WMD = ‐0.45, 95% CI = ‐0.79 to ‐0.11, z = 2.60, P < 0.01) after one month than those taking placebo. They had a worse performance on Finger Tapping after 12 months (WMD = ‐3.90, 95% CI = ‐7.85 to 0.05, z = 1.93, P < 0.05). Limited positive effects were found for the lower dosage of CEE (0.625 mg/day) which showed a significant improvement in MMSE score only when assessed at two months, and disappeared after correction for multiple testing. No significant effects for MMSE were found at longer end points (3, 6 and 12 months of treatment). With a dosage of 1.25 mg/d CEE, short‐term significant effects were found for Trial‐Making test B at one month and Digit Span backward at four months. After two months of transdermal diestradiol (E2) treatment, a highly significant effect was observed for the word recall test (WMD = 6.50, 95% CI = 4.04 to 8.96, z = 5.19, P < 0.0001). No other significant effects were found for other outcomes measured. Authors' conclusions Currently, HRT or ERT for cognitive improvement or maintenance is not indicated for women with AD. Plain language summary There is no evidence of a positive effect that estrogen replacement therapy can maintain cognitive function for a longer period of time (> five months) in women with Alzheimer's disease After the menopause, in women levels of estrogens decline. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or replacement therapy with both estrogens and progestagens (hormone replacement therapy or HRT) might theoretically help to maintain cognitive function in postmenopausal women with dementia. We therefore investigated the results of randomized controlled trials of the effects of ERT and HRT on cognitive function in postmenopausal women with AD. Overall, however, there was no evidence for positive effects of ERT or HRT which was sustained after two months of treatment. This is similar to results of studies of ERT and HRT in women without dementia, which additionally found that HRT increases the rate of dementia in women over 65 years.

AB: Abstract - Background Many members of the public have negative attitudes towards antidepressants. Psychological interventions are more acceptable but require considerable therapist training. Acceptable psychological interventions that require less training and skill are needed to ensure increased uptake of intervention. A potential intervention of this sort is relaxation techniques. Objectives To determine whether relaxation techniques reduce depressive symptoms and improve response/remission. Search methods The register of trials kept by the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group was searched up to February 2008. We also searched the reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation imagery, autogenic training) in participants diagnosed with depression or having a high level of depression symptoms. Self‐rated and clinician‐rated depression scores and response/remission were the primary outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers selected the trials, assessed the quality and extracted trial and outcome data, with discrepancies resolved by consultation with a third. Trial authors were approached for missing data where possible and missing data were estimated or imputed in some cases. Continuous measures were summarised using standardised mean differences and dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios. Main results There were 15 trials with 11 included in the meta‐analysis. Five trials showed relaxation reduced self‐reported depression compared to wait‐list, no treatment, or minimal treatment post intervention (SMD ‐0.59 (95% CI ‐0.94 to ‐0.24)). For clinician‐rated depression, two trials showed a non‐significant difference in the same direction (SMD ‐1.35 (95% CI ‐3.06 to 0.37)). Nine trials showed relaxation produced less effect than psychological (mainly cognitive‐behavioural) treatment on self‐reported depression (SMD = 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.62)). Three trials showed no significant difference between relaxation and psychological treatment on clinician‐rated depression at post intervention (SMD 0.29 (95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.75)). Inconsistent effects were found when comparing relaxation training to medication and there were few data available comparing relaxation with complementary and lifestyle treatments. Authors' conclusions Relaxation techniques were more effective at reducing self‐rated depressive symptoms than no or minimal treatment. However, they were not as effective as psychological treatment. Data on clinician‐rated depressive symptoms were less conclusive. Further research is required to investigate the possibility of relaxation being used as a first‐line treatment in a stepped care approach to managing depression, especially in younger populations and populations with subthreshold or first episodes of depression. Plain language summary Relaxation for depression Many people with depression do not get treatment or delay getting treatment. One reason for this is that they do not like antidepressants. Another is the limited availability of specialized psychological treatments, such as cognitive‐behaviour therapy. Relaxation techniques are a simple psychological treatment that can be administered after brief training. The review of 15 trials found that it was better than no treatment or minimal treatment, but not as effective as psychological therapies like cognitive‐behaviour therapy. Relaxation techniques have potential as a simple first‐line psychological treatment for depression. Those who do not respond within a set time could be offered more complex psychological treatment such as cognitive‐behaviour therapy.

AB: Abstract - Background Sulpiride may be used in combination with other antipsychotic drugs in the hope of augmenting effectiveness – especially for those whose schizophrenia has proved resistant to treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effects of sulpiride augmentation versus monotherapy for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2009) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a fixed‐effect model. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed‐effect model. Main results We included three short‐term and one long‐term trial (total N=221). All participants had schizophrenia that was either treatment‐resistant or with prominent negative symptoms. All studies compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine (+/‐ placebo), were small and at considerable risk of bias. Short‐term data of 'no clinically significant response' in global state tended to favour sulpiride augmentation of clozapine compared with clozapine alone (n=193, 3 RCTs, RR 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.09). People allocated to sulpiride plus clozapine had more movement disorders (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 48.24 CI 3.05 to 762.56) and an increase in serum prolactin (skewed data, 1 RCT), but less incidence of hypersalivation (n=162, 3 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.29 to 0.83) and less weight gain (n=64, 1 RCT, RR 0.30 CI 0.09 to 0.99). The augmentation of clozapine by sulpiride also caused less appetite loss (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.70, NNT 4 CI 4 to 12, Z=2.31, P=0.02) and less abdominal distension (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.10 CI 0.01 to 0.78, NNT 5 CI 4 to 19, Z=2.20, P=0.03). Long‐term data showed no significant difference in global state (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.42 to 1.08) and relapse (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.85 CI 0.5 to 1.3). Authors' conclusions Sulpiride plus clozapine is probably more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people whose illness has been resistant to other antipsychotic drugs including clozapine. However, much more robust data are needed. Plain language summary The efficacy of sulpiride augmentation for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic illness in which psychotic symptoms are prominent. The psychotic symptoms are often managed with drugs. Not all people with schizophrenia respond well to treatment with antipsychotic drugs and sulpiride is often used as an add‐on drug for promoting the efficacy of another medication. Several clinical trials reported effects of sulpiride augmentation for management of schizophrenia. We included four small trials which compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine alone for very ill people. Evidence from the present review suggested that short‐term sulpiride plus clozapine probably is more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people. The evidence is, however, weak and prone to considerable bias. This is a good area for more research.

AB: Abstract - Background Metrifonate is a long‐acting irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor, originally used to treat schistosomiasis. Its potential to enhance central nervous system cholinergic neurotransmission led to clinical trials for the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although low incidence of serious side effects occurred during short‐term use as an antihelmintic, in studies of the treatment of AD extending over six months, 20 patients experienced respiratory paralysis and problems with neuromuscular transmission. These findings have led to a halt to trials of metrifonate for AD and Bayer, the pharmaceutical company, has withdrawn its FDA application. Objectives 1) To establish the efficacy of metrifonate for patients with Alzheimer's disease, in terms of cognition, global impression, functional activity, non cognitive symptoms, rate of institutionalization and mortality.   2) To assess the safety and tolerability of metrifonate. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched on 29 February 2008 using the term metrifonat*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. One of the authors (LS), as member of the Metrifonate Study Group, has had the opportunity to contact other metrifonate trialists to obtain data from potentially non published data of metrifonate clinical trials. Selection criteria All unconfounded, randomized double‐blind clinical controlled trials comparing metrifonate to placebo in people with AD. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by the two reviewers, cross‐checked, and pooled when appropriate and possible. Main results Most studies assessed changes in cognitive function, global function, activities of daily living, behavioural problems, severity of disease and adverse events. Occasionally the results were not reported in sufficient detail to allow extraction of data for the meta‐analyses. The treatment regimens were varied: loading doses were used in some trials. The range of maintenance doses and studies were not pooled unless the treatment regimens were considered comparable. The lengths of treatment varied from 6 to 26 weeks and studies were not pooled unless the treatment duration was similar. The results are derived from the ITT populations. Metrifonate at various doses, fixed and loading doses, was associated with significant cognitive improvement compared to placebo, except for weekly doses where there was no difference from placebo: MMSE (metrifonate 60‐80 mg/day with initial loading at 26 weeks; metrifonate 50 mg/day fixed dose with no initial loading at 26 weeks MD 1.85, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.64, p<0.00001); ADAS‐Cog (metrifonate 60‐80 mg/day with initial loading at 26 weeks MD ‐3.24, 95% CI ‐4.40 to ‐2.08, p<0.00001) In most trials, there was improvement in clinical global impression: CIBIC‐Plus (metrifonate 30‐55 mg/day, approximately 0.65 mg/kg body weight, with initial loading at 26 weeks MD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.09 p=0.002; metrifonate 50 mg/day fixed dose with no initial loading at 26 weeks MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.01, p=0.04). There were generally‐significant drug‐placebo differences in activities of daily living but this often depended on sample size and the characteristics of the instrument used: DAD (metrifonate 30‐55 mg/day, 0.65 mg/kg body weight, with initial loading at 26 weeks MD 2.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.77, p=0.01; metrifonate 50 mg/day fixed dose with no initial loading at 26 weeks MD 4.07, 95% CI 0.29 to 7.85, p=0.03) Also there were differences associated with metrifonate compared with placebo for different doses of metrifonate in scores on a behavioural symptom scale, caregiver burden scale, and severity of disease scale.     Adverse events occurring more often with metrifonate included abdominal pain, bloating, bradycardia, diarrhoea, leg cramps, nausea and rhinitis and were described as mostly mild and transient, but occasionally moderately severe, and infrequently severe and serious. Analysis of the number of patients suffering at least one mild, moderate, severe or serious adverse event before the end of treatment showed that there was usually no difference between placebo and metrifonate. Authors' conclusions Metrifonate given once per day appears to be related to clinical response in cognition, global improvement, and activities of daily living in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.   Tolerability is good with adverse events as expected from a cholinesterase inhibitor, but with a low incidence of neuromuscular dysfunction and respiratory failure, too low to be detected in this review. It has been withdrawn from further development. Plain language summary Metrifonate for Alzheimer's disease Metrifonate cannot be recommended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Metrifonate is a long‐acting irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor. We reviewed the evidence for its efficacy in Alzheimer's disease and assessed adverse events and tolerability. At various doses it was associated with significant cognitive improvement compared to placebo, improvement in clinical global impression, and activities of daily living. Neuromuscular dysfunction with life‐threatening respiratory failure and death was reported by the pharmaceutical company and FDA, and the drug will not be further developed.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a brain disorder characterized by the permanent loss of higher cognitive functions. A number of vasodilatory drug treatments are prescribed for dementia. Naftidrofuryl is one such medicine which is reported to improve clinical symptoms significantly. The efficacy and possible adverse events of naftidrofuryl need to be reviewed systematically and assessed critically to inform clinical practice and guide the continued search for new treatment regimens. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of naftidrofuryl in the treatment of dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 11 January 2011 using the terms: naftidrofuryl. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials from major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS and CINAHL), trial registries (such as ClinicalTrials.gov) and grey literature sources. Selection criteria Randomised placebo‐controlled trials in which patients with dementia were treated with naftidrofuryl were considered eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using data extraction forms. The domains assessed for risk of bias were sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. We used odds ratios (OR) for reporting dichotomous data, and mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous data. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic. Main results We identified nine randomised controlled trials involving 847 patients with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, senile dementia and unspecified dementia. The beneficial effects were found on functional performance and behaviour (‐1.04 standardized points, 95% CI ‐1.73 to ‐0.35, P = 0.003) with a high‐level heterogeneity (I 2  = 54%), and mood (‐0.80 standardized points, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.34, P=0.0006) for patients with dementia, as well as on cognitive function (‐0.36 standardized points, 95% CI ‐0.71 to ‐0.02, P=0.04). However, this was not confirmed by clinical global measures. Naftidrofuryl was found to be well‐tolerated by patients with dementia. Authors' conclusions Oral administration of naftidrofuryl is well‐tolerated by patients with dementia.The low‐quality evidence shows that, by use of naftidrofuryl, people with dementia may benefit on performance, behaviour, cognition, and mood. However, the benefit on global impression is inconsistent and unconvincing. Plain language summary People with dementia may benefit from naftidrofuryl Dementia is characterized by chronic, global, irreversible impairment in cognitive functions, including memory, executive function and personality. It has a serious impact on patients' quality of life. Naftidrofuryl has been suggested as a treatment for dementia which may work by increasing the oxygen supply to brain tissue. The low‐quality evidence shows that naftidrofuryl may have benefits on performance, behaviour, cognition, and mood for patients with dementia. However, these benefits fail to translate into reliable clinically detectable changes. Naftidrofuryl orally administrated is well‐tolerated.

AB: Abstract - Background Prompts to encourage attendance at clinics are often used in day‐to‐day practice by diligent carers of people with mental health problems. These may take the form of telephone prompting, financial incentives or issuing a copy of the referral letter to the appointee. Objectives To estimate the effects of simple prompting by professional carers to encourage attendance at clinics for those with suspected serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2009) and reference lists, as well as contacting authors of studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria All relevant randomised (or quasi‐randomised) studies comparing the addition of 'prompts' to standard care for those with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Prompts had the stated purpose of encouraging attendance or contact with mental health teams and could be text‐based, (for example in the form of a letter), electronic, by telephone call, by personal visit, or could employ financial or other rewards. Data collection and analysis Studies and data were independently selected and extracted. For homogeneous dichotomous data the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data the reviewers calculated weighted mean differences. Main results Only four relevant trials were identified (total n=789). It is not clear whether there is any real difference between attendance of those prompted by telephone one or two days before the appointment, and those given the standard appointment management system (2 RCTs, n=457, RR missed appointment 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.1). Text‐based prompts in the form of a letter, a few days before the appointment day, may increase clinic attendance when compared with no prompt (3 RCTs, n=326, RR missed appointment 0.76 CI 0.43 to 1.32). Only one small study (n=61) reported data on the combination of telephone and text‐based prompts versus no prompt, no real difference between groups was apparent (RR missed appointment 0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.2). When telephone prompts were compared with text‐based prompts (1 RCT, n=75), the latter, in the form of an 'orientation statement' (a short paragraph, taking about 30 seconds to read, explaining the programme of care, the fee system, and providing gentle encouragement) may be somewhat more effective than the telephone prompt (RR missed appointment 1.9 CI 0.98 to 3.8). One study (n=120) compared a standard letter prompt with a letter 'orientation statement'. Overall, results tended to favour the orientation statement approach rather than the simple letter prompting attendance but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (RR missed appointment 1.6 CI 0.9 to 2.9). When prompts were considered regardless of their type, the results were of greater significance and suggested an effect to increase the rate of attendance (RR missed appointments 0.80 CI 0.65 to 0.98). The inclusion of five new studies to the awaiting classification section may affect results when assessed. Authors' conclusions There is evidence that a simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment may encourage attendance, and a simple orientation‐type letter may be more effective than a telephone prompt. This simple intervention could be a more cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance, but supplementing these data with the results of large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies would be desirable. Plain language summary Prompts to encourage appointment attendance for people with serious mental illness First appointments at a mental health clinic can be a daunting prospect. Failure to attend is common, wastes time, and can result in important delays in getting proper care. A gentle prompt, near to the time of appointment, would, if effective, seem a cost effective way of encouraging attendance. This review sought evidence for the effects of telephoning or sending a letter, in the days just before the appointment. Relevant studies were found, and although none were conclusive, all suggested that a simple prompt could indeed encourage attendance.

AB: Abstract - Background Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is an illness characterised by extreme concern about body weight and shape, severe self‐imposed weight loss, and endocrine dysfunction. In spite of its high mortality, morbidity and chronicity, there are few intervention studies on the subject. Objectives The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of acute AN. Search methods The strategy comprised of database searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE (1966 to April 28th, 2005), EMBASE (1980 to week 36, 2004), PsycINFO (1969 to August week 5, 2004), handsearching the International Journal of Eating Disorders and searching the reference lists of all papers selected. Personal letters were sent to researchers in the field requesting information on unpublished or in‐progress trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of antidepressant treatment for AN patients, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM‐IV) or similar international criteria, were selected. Data collection and analysis Quality ratings were made giving consideration to the strong relationship between allocation concealment and potential for bias in the results; studies meeting criteria A and B were included. Trials were excluded if non‐completion rates were above 50%. The standardised mean difference and relative risk were used for continuous data and dichotomous data comparisons, respectively. Whenever possible, analyses were performed according to intention‐to‐treat principles. Heterogeneity was tested with the I‐squared statistic. Weight change was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were severity of eating disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms, and global clinical state. Acceptability of treatment was evaluated by considering non‐completion rates. Main results Only seven studies were included. Major methodological limitations such as small trial size and large confidence intervals decreased the power of the studies to detect differences between treatments, and meta‐analysis of data was not possible for the majority of outcomes. Four placebo‐controlled trials did not find evidence that antidepressants improved weight gain, eating disorder or associated psychopathology. Isolated findings, favouring amineptine and nortriptyline, emerged from the antidepressant versus antidepressant comparisons, but cannot be conceived as evidence of efficacy of a specific drug or class of antidepressant in light of the findings from the placebo comparisons. Non‐completion rates were similar between the compared groups. Authors' conclusions A lack of quality information precludes us from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations on the use of antidepressants in acute AN. Future studies testing safer and more tolerable antidepressants in larger, well designed trials are needed to provide guidance for clinical practice. Plain language summary Antidepressants for anorexia nervosa The aim of the present review was to evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant treatment in acute AN. Seven small studies were identified; four placebo‐controlled trials did not find evidence of efficacy of antidepressants in improving weight gain, eating disorder or associated symptoms, as well as differences in completion rates. Meta‐analysis of data was not possible for most outcomes. However, major methodological limitations of these studies (e.g. insufficient power to detect differences) prevent from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations for antidepressant use in acute AN. Further studies testing safer antidepressants in larger and well designed trials are needed to guide clinical practice.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic‐related constipation is a common and serious adverse effect, especially for people taking clozapine. Clozapine has been shown to impede gastrointestinal motility, leading to constipation, and has been reported in up to 60% of patients receiving clozapine. In rare cases, complications can be fatal. Appropriate laxatives should be prescribed to treat constipation in people taking antipsychotics, but there is a lack of guidance on the comparative effectiveness and harms of different agents in this population. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatment for antipsychotic‐related constipation is important for clinicians and patients alike. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic treatment (versus placebo or compared against another treatment) for antipsychotic‐related constipation (defined as constipated patients of any age, who are treated with antipsychotics, regardless of dose, in which constipation is considered to be an antipsychotic‐related side effect). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 June 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in this register. We also handsearched bibliographies and contacted relevant authors for additional information. Selection criteria We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in patients with antipsychotic‐related constipation. Pharmacological treatments included laxatives and other medicines that could reasonably be used to combat constipation in this population (e.g. anticholinergic agents, like bethanecol). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from all included studies and assessed trials for risk of bias. A third author reviewed 20% of trials. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. We discussed any disagreement, documented decisions, and attempted to contact study authors when necessary. Main results We identified two relevant Chinese studies (N = 480) that contributed data to this review. Both studies were over ten years old and poorly reported, lacking descriptions of contemporary CONSORT reporting prerequisites, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, participant flow, how the sample size was determined, or how outcomes were measured. The studies also did not report trial registration, pre‐specified protocols, consent processes, ethical review, or funding source. We were unsuccessful in making contact with the authors to clarify the missing details. We classified both studies as having an overall high risk of bias. One study compared glycerol suppository with the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approaches of tuina massage and acupuncture. Compared to tuina massage, glycerol laxative was less effective in relieving constipation at both two days after treatment (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.39; very low‐quality evidence), and three days (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 4.80, CI 1.96 to 11.74, very low‐quality evidence). Favourable results were also seen for acupuncture at two days (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 3.50; 95% CI 2.18 to 5.62; very low‐quality evidence), and at three days (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 8.00, 95% CI 2.54 to 25.16; very low‐quality evidence). The other study compared mannitol, an osmotic laxative, with rhubarb soda or phenolphthalein. Mannitol was more effective than rhubarb soda or phenolphthalein in trelieving constipation within 24 hours of treatment (1 RCT; N = 240; RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27, very low‐quality evidence). No data were reported for our other important outcomes: need for rescue medication, bowel obstruction (a complication of antipsychotic‐related constipation), quality of life, adverse events, leaving the study early, and economic costs. Authors' conclusions We had hoped to find clinically useful evidence appraising the relative merits of the interventions routinely used to manage antipsychotic‐related constipation, a common and potentially serious adverse effect of the use of these drugs. The results were disappointing. There were no data comparing the common pharmacological interventions for constipation, such as lactulose, polyethylene glycol, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives, or of novel treatments such as linaclotide. Data available were very poor quality and the trials had a high risk of bias. Data from these biased studies suggested that mannitol, an osmotic laxative, was more effective than rhubarb soda and phenolphthalein in relieving constipation, and a two‐week course of glycerol suppositories was less effective than the TCM approaches of tuina massage and acupuncture. Overall, there is insufficient trial‐based evidence to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating antipsychotic‐related constipation, due to limited, poor quality data (few studies with high risk of bias and no meta‐analyses). The methodological limitations in the included studies were obvious, and any conclusions based on their results should be made with caution. Methodologically rigorous RCTs evaluating interventions for treating antipsychotic‐related constipation are needed. Plain language summary Drug treatments for constipation caused by antipsychotic medications Background   Constipation is a common side effect for people taking antipsychotic medications, especially clozapine. It has been shown that clozapine reduces bowel motility, and the consequences of this are sometimes serious. For every thousand patients treated with clozapine, it is thought that 300 to 600 will suffer constipation; at least four will develop serious gastrointestinal complications (such as bowel obstruction), from which at least one will die. Searching In June 2015, we searched for trials that compared medicines used to treat antipsychotic‐related constipation (such as laxatives) against any other treatment. However, we found little useful information. We identified two relevant studies in the Chinese literature, but none in the Western literature. Main results   The identified studies were of short duration, very likely to be biased, and provided very low‐quality evidence. One study suggested that a glycerol suppository was less effective than acupuncture or tuina massage, and the other suggested that mannitol, an osmotic laxative, was more effective than rhubarb soda or phenolphthalein in treating constipation. Conclusions   Based on our results, we conclude there is currently no good quality trial‐based evidence available that can guide clinicians and patients in the pharmacological treatment of antipsychotic‐related constipation.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009413.pub2
AB: Abstract - Background Horticultural therapy is defined as the process of utilising fruits, vegetables, flowers and plants facilitated by a trained therapist or healthcare provider, to achieve specific treatment goals or to simply improve a person's well‐being. It can be used for therapy or rehabilitation programs for cognitive, physical, social, emotional, and recreational benefits, thus improving the person's body, mind and spirit. Between 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication, and may also develop undesirable adverse effects, horticultural therapy may be of value for these people. Objectives To evaluate the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared with standard care or other additional psychosocial interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (Janurary 2013) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing horticultural therapy plus standard care with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) and for binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results We included one single blind study (total n = 24). The overall risk of bias in the study was considered to be unclear although the randomisation was adequate. It compared a package of horticultural therapy which consisted of one hour per day of horticultural activity plus standard care with standard care alone over two weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. Only two people were lost to follow‐up in the study, both in the horticultural therapy group (1 RCT n = 24,RR 5.00 95% CI 0.27 to 94.34,  very low quality evidence ). There was no clear evidence of a difference in Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI‐C) change scores between groups, however confidence intervals were wide (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐0.90 95% CI ‐10.35 to 8.55,  very low quality evidence ). At the end of treatment, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) change scores in horticultural therapy group were greater than that in the control group (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐23.70 CI ‐35.37 to ‐ 12.03, very low quality evidence). The only included study did not report on adverse effects of interventions. Authors' conclusions Based on the current very low quality data, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. This therapy remains unproven and more and larger randomised trials are needed to increase high quality evidence in this area. Plain language summary Gardening activity as a therapy for schizophrenia Horticultural therapy is based on the therapeutic value of participating in garden activities such as growing fruit or vegetables and/or flowers. Gardening is thought to improve people's well‐being through being a recreational and sociable activity which may lead to improvements in people's thinking, new friendships and more positive emotions. The benefits of gardening can also apply to people with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. Gardening reduces stress, which is important because stress can often lead to mental illness. Gardening is also hard work and a physical activity, and so motivates people with mental illness who often feel tired and apathetic. Weight gain is common for people with mental illness and gardening is good physical exercise. Since 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia experience symptoms in spite of taking antipsychotic drugs and also because these drugs have debilitating side effects, horticultural therapy may be of value to these people. This review focuses on the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. An electronic search for relevant randomised trials was run in January 2013. Only one trial was included, it randomised a total of 24 people with schizophrenia to received either their standard care plus horticultural therapy or standard care only. The trial only lasted 2 weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. There are few results and the quality of evidence was rated by the review authors to be  very low quality.  Some of the information from this one study favoured horticultural therapy but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. More large, better conducted and reported trials are required to determine the effectiveness and benefits of horticultural therapy.

AB: Abstract - Background Flupenthixol, first made available in the UK in 1965, has been used as a treatment for schizophrenia for decades. Objectives To evaluate the absolute clinical effects of flupenthixol for schizophrenia in comparison with placebo. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (August 2011), inspected references of all included or excluded studies for further trials, and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared flupenthixol with placebo for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders by any means of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were clinically important change in global state, mental state and behaviour, and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis We extracted data from the one included study, discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and contacted the authors of the included study for further information. We analysed binary outcomes using a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). For homogenous data we used a fixed‐effect model. For rare events we analysed dichotomous data using Peto Odds ratio (OR), again with 95% CIs. Main results We could include only one small (n = 45) study of moderate quality. When the active α‐flupenthixol was compared with the inactive placebo or β‐flupenthixol groups combined, fewer people in the active treatment group needed additional antipsychotic medication by around four weeks for deterioration in their general state (n = 45, OR 0.19 CI 0.05 to 0.71). There was no clear difference in social functioning at one year (n = 45, RR 1.33 CI 0.91 to 1.96). We found no clear data on mental state and behaviour, adverse effects, service use, satisfaction with treatment or costs. Authors' conclusions We were surprised that this well‐established drug had so few data from trials investigating its absolute effects. We think this is unlikely to be rectified some 50 years after its launch and know that this would not happen today. However, even though data are very limited, flupenthixol may well be worthy of careful investigation ‐ partly to ensure that this inexpensive active drug is not forgotten. Plain language summary Flupenthixol versus placebo for schizophrenia  Flupenthixol is an antipsychotic drug, first made available in the UK in 1965. Available both as a tablet and long‐acting injection, it has been used to treat schizophrenia for nearly 50 years and has been found to be effective and well tolerated by people with schizophrenia. The main side‐effects are shaking, restlessness, a dry mouth and some weight gain. Although this drug has been available for many years, few systematic reviews of its effectiveness are available and the effects of this drug in helping people cope with the symptoms of schizophrenia are not currently well measured, quantified and known. This systematic review could include only one small study which was small and 30 years old. Flupenthixol was compared with a placebo (dummy drug). Fewer people taking flupenthixol required additional antipsychotic medication but there was no clear difference in people’s ability to cope and function socially. There was no clear information on: improving people’s mental state; helping their behaviour; increasing their use of services; people’s satisfaction with treatment; or costs and cost effectiveness. Flupenthixol is widely available and inexpensive so it is perhaps understandable that it remains a popular drug used for treating people with serious mental illnesses. However, the use of flupenthixol is based more on clinical experience and the decisions of psychiatrists rather than results from large‐scale research studies and evidence‐based information. The effectiveness and benefits of flupenthixol remain largely unknown and incomplete. Large randomised and placebo‐controlled trials could be helpful in increasing knowledge about this drug.

AB: Abstract - Background Delusional disorder is commonly considered to be difficult to treat. Antipsychotic medications are frequently used and there is growing interest in a potential role for psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the treatment of delusional disorder. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of medication (antipsychotic medication, antidepressants, mood stabilisers) and psychotherapy, in comparison with placebo in delusional disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). Selection criteria Relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating treatments in delusional disorder. Data collection and analysis All review authors extracted data independently for the one eligible trial. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis with a fixed‐effect model. Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again with a fixed‐effect model. We assessed the risk of bias of the included study and used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results Only one randomised trial met our inclusion criteria, despite our initial search yielding 141 citations. This was a small study, with 17 people completing a trial comparing CBT to an attention placebo (supportive psychotherapy) for people with delusional disorder. Most participants were already taking medication  and this was continued during the trial . We were not able to include any randomised trials on medications of any type due to poor data reporting, which left us with no usable data for these trials. For the included study, usable data were limited, risk of bias varied and the numbers involved were small, making interpretation of data difficult. In particular there were no data on outcomes such as global state and behaviour, nor any information on possible adverse effects. A positive effect for CBT was found for social self esteem using the Social Self‐Esteem Inventory (1 RCT, n = 17, MD 30.5, CI 7.51 to 53.49,  very low quality evidence ), however this is only a measure of self worth in social situations and may thus not be well correlated to social function. More people left the study early if they were in the supportive psychotherapy group with 6/12 leaving early compared to 1/6 from the CBT group, but the difference was not significant (1 RCT, n = 17, RR 0.17, CI 0.02 to 1.18,  moderate quality evidence ). For mental state outcomes the results were skewed making interpretation difficult, especially given the small sample. Authors' conclusions Despite international recognition of this disorder in psychiatric classification systems such as ICD‐10 and DSM‐5, there is a paucity of  high quality  randomised trials on delusional disorder. There is currently insufficient evidence to make evidence‐based recommendations for treatments of any type for people with delusional disorder. The limited evidence that we found is not generalisable to the population of people with delusional disorder. Until further evidence is found, it seems reasonable to offer treatments which have efficacy in other psychotic disorders. Further research is needed in this area and could be enhanced in two ways: firstly, by conducting randomised trials specifically for people with delusional disorder and, secondly, by high quality reporting of results for people with delusional disorder who are often recruited into larger studies for people with a variety of psychoses. Plain language summary Treatments for delusional disorder Delusional disorder is a mental illness in which long‐standing delusions (strange beliefs) are the only or dominant symptom. There are several types of delusions. Some can make the person affected feel that they are being persecuted or can cause anxiety that they have an illness or disease that they do not have. People can have delusions of grandeur, so that they feel like they occupy a high position or are famous. Delusions can also involve jealousy of others or involve strange beliefs about body image, such as that they have a particular bodily defect. Delusional disorder is considered difficult to treat. Antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants and mood‐stabilising medications are frequently used to treat this mental illness and there is growing interest in psychological therapies such as psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a means of treatment. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of all current treatments for people with delusional disorder. A search for randomised controlled trials was run in 2012. Authors found 141 citations in the search but only one trial, randomising 17 people, could be included in the review. The study compared the effectiveness of CBT with supportive psychotherapy for people with delusional disorder. Participants were already taking medication and this was continued during the trial. The review was not able to include any studies or trials involving medications of any type used to treat delusional disorder. For the study that was included, there was limited information presented that we could use. Firm conclusions were difficult to make and no evidence on improving people's behaviour and overall mental health was available. More people left the study early from the supportive psychotherapy group, but number of participants was small and the overall difference between the groups was not enough to conclude one treatment was better than the other. A positive effect for CBT was found for people's social self esteem, although again, this finding is limited by the low quantity and quality of the data and does not relate to people's social or everyday functioning. Currently there is an overall lack of high quality evidence‐based information about the treatment of delusional disorders and insufficient evidence to make recommendations for treatments of any type. Until such evidence is found, the treatment of delusional disorders will most likely include those that are considered effective for other psychotic disorders and mental health problems. Further large‐scale and high quality research is needed in this area. Research could be improved by conducting trials specifically for people with delusional disorder.

AB: Abstract - Background Behavioural and psychiatric disturbances affect at least 50% of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Neuroleptic drugs are extensively prescribed to treat behavioural manifestations of dementia in spite of only modest efficacy and a high frequency of adverse effects. There is clearly a need for safer and more effective remedies. Trazodone is a psychoactive compound with sedative and antidepressant properties, and with mixed serotonin agonist and antagonist effects. Functional serotonergic deficits may be related to the genesis of behavioural disturbances in dementia. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of trazodone, for any type of behavioural or psychological cognition in people with dementia without an additional diagnosis of depression. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 23 March 2008 using the terms :  trazodone* OR beneficat OR desirel OR sideril OR trazodil OR trazalon. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. Selection criteria All unconfounded, double‐blind, randomised controlled trials, comparing trazodone with placebo in managing behavioural and psychiatric symptoms (except depression) in any type of dementia. Data collection and analysis Available data for this analysis were extracted from the two included studies and odds ratios or average differences, with 95% confidence intervals, calculated. Intention‐to‐treat analysis was undertaken where possible. Main results Two studies were included, comprising 104 participants with dementia. The trials differed in design: one a parallel‐group study of patients with Alzheimer's disease and another a cross‐over study of patients with frontotemporal dementia with an‐open label follow‐up trial of three years. The results from this extension study have not been used in the analysis. It was not possible to pool the data. The studies were respectively of 16 and six weeks duration, using trazodone from 50 to 300 mg daily. Both trials examined global clinical state, behavioural disturbances and cognitive function. The parallel study also assessed activities of daily living and caregiver burden. Compared with placebo, the use of trazodone was not associated with statistically significant benefits for behavioural manifestations as measured by various rating scales. Analysis of changes from baseline for clinical impression of change and for cognitive function did not produce statistically significant results in favour of trazodone. A variety of adverse effects were recorded with no significant differences between trazodone and placebo. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of trazodone as a treatment for behavioural and psychological manifestations of dementia. In order to assess effectiveness and safety of trazodone, longer‐term randomized controlled trials are needed, involving larger samples of participants with a wider variety of types and severities of dementia. Plain language summary Insufficient evidence from randomized, placebo‐controlled studies to support a recommendation that trazodone should be prescribed, or not prescribed, for BPSD The rationale for using trazodone is that it is a sedating atypical serotonergic antidepressant with a low rate of adverse effects and some behavioural and psychological symptoms in people with dementia (BPSD) are associated with serotonergic dysfunction. The conclusion is based on limited data from two small studies. The larger of the studies, conducted in 73 patients with Alzheimer's disease, showed no beneficial effect of trazodone at all. A smaller cross‐over study in patients with frontal lobe dementia showed a trend for reduction in some symptoms in the first study period. Larger, longer studies are needed to explore the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of trazodone.

AB: Abstract - Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non‐randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of psychological therapy, light therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence. Main results We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full‐text review for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of blinding. The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45‐ to 60‐minute sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology‐Self‐Report (IDS‐SR, range 0‐90) from September 2011 to mid‐April 2012. The incidence of a new depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS‐SR ≥ 20), compared to 74% of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality‐evidence). For participants with depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups. Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS‐SR, and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI ‐3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality‐evidence). The overall discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low quality‐evidence). Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors' conclusions The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes a depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who might be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced SAD or who has relatives and friends who have experienced SAD, as well as researchers working in this field might be interested in this review. What questions does this review aim to answer? The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. However, little is known about the efficacy and potential harms of interventions for preventing SAD. This is one of four reviews conducted to examine the efficacy and side effects of interventions used to prevent SAD; this review focuses on psychological therapy as a preventive intervention in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms at the time the preventive intervention was started. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to 19 June 2018 for studies on psychological therapies to prevent SAD. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received a form of psychological therapy ‐ the so called mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) or treatment as usual. Treatment as usual meant that participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. All individuals in these studies had a history of winter depression and were free of depressive symptoms when the study started. What does evidence from this review reveal? The proportion of participants developing a depression in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups as well as the severity of these depressive episodes. However, the quality of the evidence was very low, so we can draw no valid conclusion if MBCT is really ineffective in preventing SAD or not. The included study reported no information on side effects of the intervention. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of MBCT and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as other psychological therapies, drug treatments, or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, treatment selection should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of different psychological therapies in preventing SAD in larger study samples and should directly compare these interventions versus other preventive treatments, such as light therapy, antidepressants and agomelatine, to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is a common mental disorder. It affects millions of people worldwide and is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the leading causes of disability. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well‐established treatment for severe depression. Intravenous anaesthetic medication is used to minimize subjective unpleasantness and adverse side effects of the induced tonic‐clonic seizure. The influence of different anaesthetic medications on the successful reduction of depressive symptoms and adverse effects is unclear. Objectives This review evaluated the effects of different regimens of intravenous sedatives and hypnotics on anti‐depression efficacy, recovery and seizure duration in depressed adults undergoing ECT. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (from 1966 to 31 December 2012); and EMBASE via Ovid SP (from 1966 to 31 December 2012). We handsearched related journals and applied no language restrictions. We reran the search in Feburary 2017. Four potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ‘Studies awaiting Classification' and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials evaluating the effects of different intravenous sedatives and hypnotics for ECT. We excluded studies and trials using placebo or inhalational anaesthetics and studies that used no anaesthetic. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When possible, data were pooled and risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were computed using the Cochrane Review Manager statistical package (RevMan). Main results We included in the review 18 RCTs (599 participants; published between 1994 and 2012). Most of the included trials were at high risk of bias. We analysed the results of studies comparing six different intravenous anaesthetics. Only a few studies comparing propofol with methohexital (four studies) and with thiopental (three studies) could be pooled. No difference was noted in the reduction of depression scores observed in participants treated with propofol compared with methohexital (low‐quality evidence). These four studies were not designed to detect differences in depression scores. The duration of electroencephalograph (EEG) and of motor seizures was shorter in the propofol group compared with the methohexital group (low‐quality evidence). No difference was seen in EEG seizure duration when propofol was compared with thiopental (low‐quality evidence). Time to recovery (following commands) was longer among participants after anaesthesia with thiopental compared with propofol (low‐quality evidence). For the remaining comparisons of anaesthetics, only single studies or insufficient data were available. Adverse events were inadequately reported in eligible trials, and none of the included trials reported anaesthesia‐related mortality. Authors' conclusions Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias, and the quality of evidence was generally low. The studies were not designed to detect clinically relevant differences in depression scores. Anaesthetic agents should be chosen on the basis of adverse effect profile, emergence and how these medications affect seizure duration. If it is difficult to elicit an adequately long seizure, methohexital may be superior to propofol (low‐quality evidence). If a patient is slow to recover from anaesthesia, propofol may allow a faster time to follow commands than thiopental (low‐quality evidence). A factor of clinical concern that was not addressed by any study was adrenal suppression from etomidate. Optimal dosages of intravenous sedatives or hypnotics have not yet been determined. Larger well‐designed randomized studies are needed to determine which intravenous anaesthetic medication leads to the greatest improvement in depression scores with minimal adverse effects. Plain language summary Different regimens of intravenous sedatives or hypnotics for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adult patients with depression Depression is a common mental disorder. It can present as loss of interest or pleasure, sadness, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of guilt or low self worth. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that depression was the second leading cause of disability‐adjusted life‐years among all men and women between 15 and 44 years of age. The treatment of choice for severe and recurrent depression is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT involves the application of an electrical current to the patient's head. The aim is to induce a controlled convulsion. Patients usually undergo several sessions of ECT. To minimize adverse events and improve the quality of ECT, patients receive anaesthetic agents such as intravenous sedatives or hypnotics. These agents can influence the effectiveness of ECT but can cause potential adverse effects. It would be helpful to identify which is the best anaesthetic agent for ECT in this group of patients. This Cochrane review examined whether different types of anaesthetic agents could have an effect on anti‐depression therapy and reported on the safety of those agents. The evidence is current to December 2012. We included in this review 18 randomized controlled trials (599 participants). We analysed nine pairs of comparisons: methohexital versus propofol; thiopental versus propofol; etomidate versus propofol; thiopental versus etomidate; etomidate versus methohexital; methohexital versus midazolam; thiopental versus midazolam; midazolam versus propofol; and thiamylal versus propofol. Our analysis revealed no difference in the reduction of depression scores when methohexital was compared with propofol. Propofol reduced seizure duration to a greater extent than methohexital. No difference in seizure duration was noted when thiopental was compared with propofol. Patients recovered faster from anaesthesia when propofol rather than thiopental was used. Adverse events related to anaesthesia induction agents and to the treatment for depression were not well reported in most trials. We found the quality of the evidence to be low. Larger well‐designed randomized controlled trials are needed. More clinically relevant outcomes (such as remission of depressive symptoms and postanaesthetic adverse events) during a longer follow‐up period should be reported in future studies. We reran the search in Feburary 2017. Four potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ‘Studies awaiting Classification' and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a serious chronic mental illness affecting an estimated 21 million people worldwide and there is increasing evidence linking inflammation in the brain to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs are the conventional treatment for people with schizophrenia but are not always fully effective. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) with properties that inhibit the proinflammatory status of the brain. Using aspirin as an adjunct (add‐on) treatment to antipsychotics or as a stand‐alone treatment could be a novel, relatively inexpensive option for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as adjunct (add‐on) or as stand‐alone treatment for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (last search 8 March 2018) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials focusing on aspirin for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We included two studies, both comparing the effects of adding aspirin to standard antipsychotic treatment with adding placebo to standard antipsychotic treatment. We were hoping to find high‐quality data for seven main outcomes of importance: clinically important change in global state, mental state, cognitive functioning and quality of life, numbers leaving the study early, incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and hospital admission. Clinically important change data were not reported. Global state data were reported by one study as 'unspecified problem necessitating change in dose or type of antipsychotics'; there was no clear difference between treatment groups for this outcome (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.88; studies = 1; participants = 70; very low‐quality evidence). Both trials measured mental state using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and mean total PANSS endpoint scores favoured the adjunct aspirin group in the medium term (MD –6.56, 95% CI –12.04 to –1.08; studies = 2; participants = 130; very low‐quality evidence). Less than 10% of each group's participants left the studies early (for any reason) and by around three months there was no clear difference between numbers leaving early from the aspirin group compared to numbers leaving early from the placebo group suggesting aspirin is acceptable (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.14; studies = 2; participants = 130; very low‐quality evidence). There was some gastric upset in both groups but rates were not clearly different between the treatment groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.94; studies = 1; participants = 70; very low‐quality evidence). We are unclear if 'change in hospital status' is an unfavourable outcome or not as one study reported equivocal data (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.90; studies = 1; participants = 70; very low‐quality evidence). It should be noted that all the above results were based on data of very low‐quality and were difficult to interpret for clinicians or patients, and that the two studies, completed in the last decade, failed to report any usable outcomes on cognitive functioning or quality of life. Authors' conclusions We highlighted the evidence that some pioneering researchers feel this question is important enough to merit testing in randomised trials. However, we also highlighted that the evidence produced from these trials was weak and inconclusive. It was impossible to draw clear conclusions on the therapeutic value of aspirin for schizophrenia from these short, small and limited trials. Plain language summary Aspirin as an add‐on treatment to antipsychotics for people schizophrenia Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects around 21 million people worldwide. The symptoms of schizophrenia are typically classified into positive (e.g. hallucinations and delusional thoughts), negative (e.g. withdrawal and difficulty with social interaction) and cognitive (e.g. poor attention and restricted working memory) groups. These symptoms cause distortions in an individual's behaviour, thinking, emotions, sense of self and perception. Usually, antipsychotic medicines are used for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. In recent years, inflammation (swelling) in a person's brain was linked to the symptoms that accompany schizophrenia. Aspirin is an affordable medicine which acts against inflammation and, therefore, it is thought it could help reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. In this review, we looked at the effects of using aspirin as an add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia. Study characteristics After searching Cochrane Schizophrenia's database in March 2018 and assessing the search results, we included one randomised controlled trial (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) from the Netherlands (70 participants) and one from Iran (60 participants). Both trials used aspirin as an add‐on treatment to standard antipsychotic medication and compared it with placebo (a dummy treatment), also as an add‐on to standard treatment. Key results Participants receiving aspirin had slightly better results for their mental state, which was measured with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). For side effects related to stomach problems, there seemed to be no clear difference between the groups. The same applied to changes in hospital status and leaving the study early. However, all these results were based on analyses of very poor data and graded as very low‐quality evidence. No trial gave usable information on cognitive functioning or quality of life. Quality of the evidence This review was based on results from only two small trials, which made it impossible to say whether aspirin would be a good treatment option for people with schizophrenia. More information from the trials that are underway could strengthen the results of this analysis.

AB: Abstract - Background Research evidence suggests that both mental health professionals and people with severe mental health illness such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder find it difficult to communicate with each other effectively about symptoms, treatments and their side effects so that they reach a shared understanding about diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Effective use of communication skills in mental health interactions could be associated with increased patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment. Objectives To review the effectiveness of communication skills training for mental health professionals who work with people with severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Trials Register (latest search 17 February, 2016) which is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that focused on communication skills training (CST) for mental health professionals who work with people with severe mental illness compared with those who received standard or no training. We sought a number of primary (patient adherence to treatment and attendance at scheduled appointments as well as mental health professionals' satisfaction with the training programme) and secondary outcomes (patients' global state, service use, mental state, patient satisfaction, social functioning, quality of life). RCTs where the unit of randomisation was by cluster (e.g. healthcare facility) were also eligible for inclusion. We included one trial that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis We independently selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we planned to calculate standard estimates of the risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups, or obtain the adjusted mean difference (aMD) where available for cluster‐randomised trials. If heterogeneity had been identified, we would have explored this using a random‐effects model. We used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table and we assessed risk of bias for the one included study. Main results We included one pilot cluster‐RCT that recruited a total of 21 psychiatrists and 97 patients. The psychiatrists were randomised to a training programme in communication skills, compared to a no specific training (NST) programme. The trial provided useable data for only one of our prestated outcomes of interest, patient satisfaction. The trial did not report global state but did report mental state and, as global state data were not available, we included these mental state data in the 'Summary of findings' table. There was high risk of bias from attrition because of substantial losses to follow‐up and incomplete outcome data. Patient satisfaction was measured as satisfaction with treatment and 'experience of therapeutic relationship' at medium term (five months). Satisfaction with treatment was similar between the CST and NST group using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‐8) (1 RCT, n = 66/97*, aMD 1.77 95% CI ‐ 0.13 to 3.68,  low‐quality evidence ). When comparing patient experience of the therapeutic relationship using the STAR‐P scale, participants in the CST group rated the therapeutic relationship more positively than participants in the NST group (1 RCT, n = 63/97, aMD 0.21 95% CI 0.01 to 0.41,  low‐quality evidence ). Mental state scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were similar between treatment groups for general symptoms (1 RCT, n = 59/97, aMD 4.48 95% CI ‐2.10 to 11.06,  low‐quality evidence ), positive symptoms (1 RCT, n = 59/97, aMD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐2.91 to 2.45,  low‐quality evidence ) and negative symptoms (1 RCT, n = 59/97, aMD 3.42, 95%C CI ‐0.24 to 7.09,  low‐quality evidence ). No data were available for adherence to treatment, service use or quality of life. * Of the total of 97 randomised participants, 66 provided data. Authors' conclusions The evidence available is from one pilot cluster‐randomised controlled trial, it is not adequate enough to draw any robust conclusions. There were relatively few good quality data and the trial is too small to highlight differences in most outcome measures. Adding a CST programme appears to have a modest positive effect on patients' experiences of the therapeutic relationship. More high‐quality research is needed in this area. Plain language summary Communication skills training for mental health professionals working with people with severe mental illness Question Does communication skills training for mental health professionals benefit their patients with severe mental illness? Background Severe mental illness (such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) is a mental, behavioural or emotional disorder which severely interferes with, or limits a person’s life activities for a prolonged time (e.g. from a few months to a few years). People with severe mental health problems do not always follow their treatment plans. Effective communication between health professionals and their patients is an essential part of ensuring that vital information about treatment options and maintaining contact with services is understood and followed to by the patient. For patients with severe mental health problems, and their carers, this interaction can be challenging. There are many negative outcomes for patients with severe mental health problems who experience ineffective communication with health professionals, which include alienation, increase of symptoms and possible compulsory hospitalisation. It is thought that when effective communication skills are used by mental health professionals, their patients are more satisfied and adhere to their treatment plans. Moreover, professional‐patient rapport is a necessary part of giving the patient the confidence to be pro‐active in their treatment regimens. However, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to guide practice in this area for people with severe mental illness. Searches We ran a search for RCTs using Cochrane Schizophrenia's register of trials, latest search date was in February 2016. Only five possible studies were found and from these only one pilot study could be included. It measured the effect on patients of communication skills training for psychiatrists ability to identify and clarify misunderstandings during communication with patients. Results We were interested in the effect communication skills training had on patient adherence to treatment, satisfaction, mental state, service use and quality of life. We could only use data reported for the patient's satisfaction with the treatment, with the therapeutic relationship and mental state (psychiatric symptoms). Five months after treatment, patients who were treated by psychiatrists who received communication training had a modest increase in satisfaction with the therapeutic relationship compared with patients treated by psychiatrists who did not receive the training. Satisfaction with treatment and mental state of the patient were similar between the two treatment groups. Conclusions These results are based on low‐quality evidence are not conclusive; the available evidence is from one small pilot trial, which is not adequate enough to draw any meaningful conclusions. Much more high‐quality research is needed in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Long‐term treatment with antipsychotic medications in early episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders is common, but both short and long‐term effects on the illness are unclear. There have been numerous suggestions that people with early episodes of schizophrenia appear to respond differently than those with multiple prior episodes. The number of episodes may moderate response to drug treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of antipsychotic medication treatment on people with early episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group register (July 2007) as well as references of included studies. We contacted authors of studies for further data. Selection criteria Studies with a majority of first and second episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders comparing initial antipsychotic medication treatment with placebo, milieu, or psychosocial treatment. Data collection and analysis Working independently, we critically appraised records from 681studies, of which five studies met inclusion criteria. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) where possible. For continuous data, we calculated mean difference (MD). We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. Main results Five studies (combined total n=998) met inclusion criteria. Four studies (n=724) provided leaving the study early data and results suggested that individuals treated with a typical antipsychotic medication are less likely to leave the study early than those treated with placebo (Chlorpromazine: 3 RCTs n=353, RR 0.4 CI 0.3 to 0.5, NNT 3.2, Fluphenaxine: 1 RCT n=240, RR 0.5 CI 0.3 to 0.8, NNT 5; Thioridazine: 1 RCT n=236, RR 0.44 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNT 4.3, Trifulperazine: 1 RCT n=94, RR 0.96 CI 0.3 to 3.6). Two studies contributed data to assessment of adverse effects and present a general pattern of more frequent side effects among individuals treated with typical antipsychotic medications compared to placebo. One trial suggested a higher rehospitalisation rate for those receiving chlorpromazine compared to placebo (n=80, RR 2.29 CI 1.3 to 4.0, NNH 2.9). However, a higher attrition in the placebo group is likely to have introduced a survivor bias into this comparison. One study contributes data to a comparison of trifluoperazine to psychotherapy on long‐term health in favour of the trifluoperazine group (n=92, MD 5.8 CI 1.6 to 0.0); however, data from this study are also likely to contain biases due to selection and attrition. One other study contributes data to a comparison of typical antipsychotic medication to psychosocial treatment on six‐week outcome measures of global psychopathology (n=89, MD 0.01 CI ‐0.6 to 0.6) and global improvement (n=89, MD ‐0.03 CI ‐0.5 to 0.4), indicating no between‐group differences. On the whole, there is very little useable data in the few studies meeting inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions With only a few studies meeting inclusion criteria, and with limited useable data in these studies, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. The preliminary pattern of evidence suggests that people with early episode schizophrenia treated with typical antipsychotic medications are less likely to leave the study early, but more likely to experience medication‐related side effects. Data are too sparse to assess the effects of antipsychotic medication on outcomes in early episode schizophrenia. Plain language summary Antipsychotic medication for early episode schizophrenia There are only a few good quality studies comparing the acute treatment of early episode schizophrenia with an antipsychotic medication compared to placebo or psychosocial treatment. It appears that initial medication treatment reduces the study attrition rates while also increasing the risk for medication‐induced side effects. Data are too limited to assess the effects of initial antipsychotic medication treatment on outcomes for individuals with an early episode of schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a prevalence of about 1% among the general population. It is listed among the top 10 causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. Antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment. Piperacetazine has been reported to be as clinically effective as chlorpromazine, a well established 'benchmark' antipsychotic, for people with schizophrenia. However, the side effect profiles of these antipsychotics differ and it is important that an evidence base is available comparing the benefits, and potential harms of these two antipsychotics. Objectives To assess the clinical and side effects of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses in comparison with piperacetazine. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (6 June 2015 and 8 October 2018) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for people with schizophrenia, reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We found 12 records referring to six trials. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. We excluded one trial. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor. Only short‐term data were available. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; participants = 208; studies = 2; very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported change scores on the mental state scale Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); no clear difference was observed (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 0.61; participants = 182; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Chlorpromazine appears no worse or better than piperacetazine regarding adverse effects. In both treatment groups, around 60% of participants experienced some sort of adverse effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33; participants = 74; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence), with approximately 40% of these participants experiencing some parkinsonism‐type movement disorder (RR 0.95, CI 0.61 to 1.49; participants = 106; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence). No clear difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early for any reason was observed (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.56; participants = 256; studies = 4; very low‐quality evidence). No trial reported data for change in negative symptoms or economic costs. Authors' conclusions The results of this review show chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy, but data are based on very small numbers of participants and the evidence is very low quality. We can not make firm conclusions based on such data. Currently, should clinicians and people with schizophrenia need to choose between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine they should be aware there is no good quality evidence to base decisions. More high quality research is needed. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for schizophrenia Review question Is the antipsychotic drug, chlorpromazine, better or worse than the antipsychotic drug, piperacetazine, for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that severely disrupts a person's thought processes and affects around 1% of the general population. Schizophrenia is listed among the top 10 causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have a lower life expectancy and an increased risk of suicide. There are two main types of symptoms, positive and negative. Common positive symptoms include delusions (beliefs that are not based in reality) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real). Negative symptoms include social withdrawal and lack of motivation and poor emotional response. Positive symptoms are usually of short duration and the negative symptoms can be long term. Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of antipsychotic drugs and psychological therapies. Chlorpromazine and piperacetazine are antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia, however, they both can also cause unpleasant side effects. This review aims to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the effectiveness and safety of both of these drugs. Searching for evidence A search for randomised controlled trials that could be relevant to this review was carried out on 6 June 2015, and another search was carried out 8 October 2018. This was achieved by searching the Specialised Register of Cochrane Schizophrenia. The 2015 search found six possible trials and we carefully checked these to see if we could include them in the review. The 2018 search found no new trials. Results Five trials, randomising a total of 343 participants met the review requirements for inclusion. These trials randomly allocated participants to receive either chlorpromazine or piperacetazine. Data were reported for participants' global and mental state after treatment, incidence of adverse effects and numbers leaving the trial early. However, we did not find any data concerning service use, functioning of participants or economic costs of these treatments. The overall results showed chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy and side effect profiles. However, these results are based on very low‐quality data. Conclusions The number of included studies and the sample size of participants included in this review is small, and the quality of data very low, so the results of this review are not conclusive and must be used with caution. Further research would be needed before decisions can be made regarding which drug is more effective.

AB: Abstract - Background Piracetam is a drug that may enhance memory and other intellectual functions, but its usefulness in treating dementia is uncertain. It is, however, commonly prescribed for cognitive impairment and dementia in several countries of continental Europe. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy of piracetam for features of dementia (classified into the major subtypes: vascular, Alzheimer's disease or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, or unclassified dementia) or cognitive impairment not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia. Search methods We searched  ALOIS  ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 4 December 2011 using the terms: piracetam, nootropic, "2‐Oxo‐1‐pyrrolidine", Lucetam, Nootropil, Breinox. We identified another review by employees and consultants of the manufacturing company, UCB Pharma (Waegemans 2002) which included data from unpublished studies not made available to Cochrane review authors. Selection criteria All unconfounded, randomized, double‐blind trials in which treatment with piracetam was administered for more than a day and compared with placebo in people with dementia of Alzheimer type, vascular dementia, or mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, or unclassified dementia, or cognitive impairment not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. We used Intention‐to‐treat analysis where feasible and pooled studies if appropriate. We planned to perform sensitivity analyses to determine if studies performing poorly on quality criteria affected results. The pharmaceutical company marketing piracetam did not release the results of several unpublished trials. Main results There were 24 included studies with 11959 participants in total. Many studies were of cross‐over design and first‐phase data were unavailable, or could not be extracted. Global impression of change (GIC) was the only outcome for which pooling of data was possible, involving only four studies. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the results, Chi 2  test = 19.17 (df = 3, P < 0.001). The odds ratio (OR) for improvement in the piracetam group compared with placebo was 3.43 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32 to 5.07). Using a fixed‐effect model, the OR for improvement with piracetam compared with placebo was 3.55 (95% CI 2.45 to 5.16). This estimate was derived from completers rather than from an intention‐to‐treat analysis as relevant data could not be extracted from the reports. In the limited data available, no significant differences were found between treatment and placebo groups for cognition (immediate memory, visuospatial, Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), delayed memory or speech) for dependency, or for depression. The large volume of unpublished and untraceable data not available to the review authors raises the possibility of publication bias. Authors' conclusions Published evidence does not support the use of piracetam in the treatment of people with dementia or cognitive impairment. Although effects were found on global impression of change, no benefit was shown by any of the more specific measures of cognitive function. The evidence indicates a need for further evaluation of piracetam. Plain language summary Evidence for the efficacy of piracetam for dementia or cognitive impairment is inadequate for clinical use but sufficient to justify further research Piracetam was one of the first drugs used for dementia and comes from the class of drugs called nootropics, whose putative actions are still poorly defined. Most of the trials of piracetam were undertaken many years ago and did not use methods which would be currently considered standard. Some of the studies suggested there may be some benefit from piracetam but overall the evidence is not consistent or positive enough to support its use for dementia or cognitive impairment.

AB: Abstract - Background The main pharmacological approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been based on the use of agents potentiating cholinergic transmission, particularly by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine after it has been secreted into the synaptic clefts. Physostigmine is an AChE inhibitor originally extracted from calabar beans. It is licensed in many countries as an agent for reversing the effect of drugs and poisons causing the anticholinergic syndrome. Studies conducted more than 20 years ago suggested that physostigmine could improve memory in people with or without dementia. Investigation of this property has been limited by the very short half‐life of physostigmine. Various forms of administering the drug have been tried to overcome this problem, most recently a controlled‐release (CR) oral formulation, and a skin patch. Objectives To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of physostigmine in Alzheimer's disease. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 10 January 2008 using the terms: physostigmine OR syrapton OR antilirium. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. We asked Forest Laboratories and Pharmax, owners of the rights to market physostigmine for Alzheimer's disease, for additional data and reports of clinical trials but we did not receive any information. Selection criteria All relevant unconfounded, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials in which physostigmine was administered for more than one day to patients with dementia of Alzheimer type. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (JMC and JB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the weighted or standardized mean differences or Peto odds ratios (95% CI) were estimated. Where possible, intention‐to‐treat analysis was used. Main results Fifteen studies were included using four different methods of administration of physostigmine. Four studies, 29 people, used intravenous infusion; seven, 131 people, used a conventional oral form; four, 1456 people, used a controlled‐release oral form, and one study of 181 people used a verum skin patch. Intravenous infusion    There are no usable results from the intravenous infusion trials, Oral form    The few results from the trials of the conventional oral form showed no benefit of physostigmine compared with placebo.     Controlled release    The results from two of the four studies of the controlled‐release physostigmine apply only to a group of patients identified as responders in a pre‐randomization titration period. The best dose physostigmine was associated with improvement on the ADAS‐Cog score compared with placebo at 6, 12 weeks. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of patients from the physostigmine group withdrawing from the trial (22/183 vs 2/183)(OR 5.92, 95% confidence limits 2.59 to 13.54, p<0.0001) and suffering at least one event of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, dizziness, stomach pain, flatulence or sweating compared with placebo at 6 weeks. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of patients from the physostigmine group withdrawing from the trial due to adverse events (13/83 vs 5/93)(OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.15 to 8.07, p=0.02) and suffering at least one event of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, dizziness, stomach pain, tremor, asthenia or sweating compared with placebo at 12 weeks. When no attempt was made to identify responders and all relevant patients with Alzheimer's disease were randomized, fixed dose physostigmine (mean 33 mg/day) was associated with a statistically significantly higher number withdrawing (234/358 vs 31/117)(OR 4.82, 95% CI 3.17 to 7.33, p<0.00001), withdrawing due to adverse events (196/358 vs 10/117) (OR 6.54, 95%CI 4.29 to 9.95, p<0.00001) and suffering at least one event of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, dizziness, stomach pain, dyspepsia, sweating, asthenia, dyspnoea or abnormal dreaming, but with no benefit on cognition compared with placebo at 24 weeks. Verum patch    The double dose (delivering mean dose 12 mg/day) was associated with statistically significantly higher numbers suffering at least one adverse event of vomiting, nausea, or abdominal cramps, and the lower dose (delivering mean dose 5.7mg/day) was associated with statistically significantly higher numbers suffering gastrointestinal complaints compared with placebo at 24 weeks. There was no difference between physostigmine (higher and lower dose) and placebo for numbers improved (CGIC) at 24 weeks. Authors' conclusions The evidence of effectiveness of physostigmine for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease is limited. Even in a controlled release formulation designed to overcome the short half‐life, physostigmine showed no convincing benefit and adverse effects remained common leading to a high rate of withdrawal. Plain language summary Limited evidence of effectiveness of physostigmine for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; it works by obstructing the enzyme responsible for ACh destruction in the synaptic cleft. Studies conducted more than 20 years ago suggested that physostigmine could improve memory in people with or without dementia. Investigation of this property has been limited by the very short half‐life of physostigmine. Various forms of administering the drug have been tried to overcome this problem, most recently a controlled‐release (CR) oral formulation, and a skin patch. An additional limiting factor has been a high incidence of adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Physostigmine appears to have no advantage over some newer anticholinesterase drugs. The short half‐life remains a serious disadvantage and requires complex forms of administration. There is no reason to recommend further research into this drug.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000147
AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is an age‐associated syndrome most commonly due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or cerebrovascular disease. Calcium has an important role in regulating brain functions. Calcium ions link membrane excitation to subsequent intracellular molecular responses. Age‐associated changes in calcium homoeostasis have possible repercussions on higher cortical functions. Nimodipine is an isopropyl calcium channel blocker which readily crosses the blood‐brain barrier. Its primary action is to reduce the number of open calcium channels in cell membranes, thus restricting influx of calcium ions into cells. The usefulness of nimodipine in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and unspecified dementia is still controversial. In spite of the uncertainties about its efficacy in dementia, nimodipine is currently frequently prescribed for cognitive impairment and dementia in several continental European countries. Objectives To assess the clinical efficacy of nimodipine for the manifestations of dementia, in unclassified disease and in the major subtypes ‐ Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and mixed Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular disease. Search methods We searched  ALOIS  ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 26 March 2010 using the term: nimodipine The search of August 2005 identified two studies which were excluded. The search of January 2008 identified six new studies for consideration, only one met the inclusion criteria for this meta‐analysis although the data were difficult to interpret and they were not included in this update (Pantoni 2005). The latest search of March 2010 identified no new studies for inclusion within the review. Selection criteria All unconfounded, double‐blind, randomized trials in which treatment with nimodipine was administered for more than a day and compared with placebo in patients with dementia, of unclassified type or attributable to Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, or mixed Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular disease. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by the reviewers and the odds ratio (95% CI) or the average difference (95% CI) were estimated. Both intention‐to‐treat and on‐treatment results were extracted. Main results Fifteen trials were included which tested two treatment regimes, 90 and 180 mg/day of nimodipine for 12, 24 weeks and 52 weeks. Two trials included only patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 10 trials included only patients with cerebrovascular dementia (CVD), and three trials included patients with AD, CVD and mixed disease. Available outcome data from nine trials (2492 patients) cover the domains of cognitive function, activities of daily living, global clinical state, safety and tolerability. By pooling available data from all trials, whatever the diagnosis of the patients included, this review found benefit associated with nimodipine (90 mg/day at 12 weeks) compared with placebo on the SCAG scale (WMD ‐7.59, 95% CI ‐9.87 to ‐5.31, P<0.00001), on clinical global impression (WMD ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.07 to ‐0.67, P<0.00001) and cognitive function (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81, P<0.00001) but not on scales assessing activities of daily living. When the AD trials and the VD trials were pooled separately, similar significant results were found for the 90 mg/day dose of nimodipine at 12 weeks. Drop‐out rates were low in the trials, affecting similar proportions of treatment and placebo groups. Nimodipine is well tolerated with a low rate of adverse effects similar to that associated with placebo. There were slightly more adverse cerebrovascular events, and adverse events due to blood problems, associated with placebo than with nimodipine, and adverse autonomic events were slightly more common with nimodipine than with placebo. Authors' conclusions Nimodipine can be of some benefit in the treatment of patients with features of dementia due to unclassified disease or to Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, or mixed Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular disease. It appears to be well tolerated with few side effects. Data were not available from several trials, a total of more than 500 patients. A meta‐analysis of individual patient data from all trials is desirable. Dementia is a chronic disorder and the short‐term benefits of nimodipine demonstrated in the trials reviewed do not justify its use as a long‐term anti‐dementia drug. New research must focus on longer term outcomes. Plain language summary Evidence of some short‐term benefit of nimodipine for people with dementia The efficacy of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been tested in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and multi‐infarct dementia, the commonest forms of dementia in older people. The rationale for its use is to restrict the influx of calcium ions into neurons, and, by vasodilatation, to improve blood flow to the brain. This review found evidence of some short‐term benefit attributable to nimodipine, mainly in measures of cognitive function and global impression, but not in activities on daily living, for patients with degenerative and multi‐infarct dementia, and mixed dementia. Nimodipine is well tolerated with a low rate of adverse effects similar to that associated with placebo.

AB: Abstract - Background Lifetime prevalence of depression in subjects with opioid dependence is higher than in the general population (44‐54% versus 16%) and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. Search methods We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Selection criteria Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Main results Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria. ‐ Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes' measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. ‐ Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). Authors' conclusions There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results. Plain language summary Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids.

AB: Abstract - Background People with serious mental illness not only experience an erosion of functioning in day‐to‐day life over a protracted period of time, but evidence also suggests that they have a greater risk of experiencing oral disease and greater oral treatment needs than the general population. Poor oral hygiene has been linked to coronary heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory disease and impacts on quality of life, affecting everyday functioning such as eating, comfort, appearance, social acceptance, and self esteem. Oral health, however, is often not seen as a priority in people suffering with serious mental illness. Objectives To review the effects of oral health education (advice and training) with or without monitoring for people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (5 November 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on oral health education (advice and training) with or without monitoring for people with serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1358 participants. None of the studies provided useable data for the key outcomes of not having seen a dentist in the past year, not brushing teeth twice a day, chronic pain, clinically important adverse events, and service use. Data for leaving the study early and change in plaque index scores were provided. Oral health education compared with standard care When 'oral health education' was compared with 'standard care', there was no clear difference between the groups for numbers leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 50, RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.24,  moderate‐quality evidence ), while for dental state: no clinically important change in plaque index, an effect was found. Although this was statistically significant and favoured the intervention group, it is unclear if it was clinically important (1 RCT, n = 40, MD ‐ 0.50 95% CI ‐ 0.62 to ‐ 0.38,  very low quality evidence ).These limited data may have implications regarding improvement in oral hygiene. Motivational interview + oral health education compared with oral health education Similarly, when 'motivational interview + oral health education' was compared with 'oral health education', there was no clear difference for the outcome of leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 60 RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.23,  moderate‐quality evidence ), while for dental state: no clinically important change in plaque index, an effect favouring the intervention group was found (1 RCT, n = 56, MD ‐ 0.60 95% CI ‐ 1.02 to ‐ 0.18  very low‐quality evidence ). These limited, clinically opaque data may or may not have implications regarding improvement in oral hygiene. Monitoring compared with no monitoring For this comparison, only data for leaving the study early were available. We found a difference in numbers leaving early, favouring the 'no monitoring' group (1 RCT, n = 1682, RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14,  moderate‐quality evidence ). However, these data are problematic. The control denominator is implied and not clear, and follow‐up did not depend only on individual participants, but also on professional caregivers and organisations ‐ the latter changing frequently resulting in poor follow‐up, but not a good reflection of the acceptability of the monitoring to patients. For this comparison, no data were available for 'no clinically important change in plaque index'. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence from trials that oral health advice helps people with serious mental illness in terms of clinically meaningful outcomes. It makes sense to follow guidelines and recommendations such as those put forward by the British Society for Disability and Oral Health working group until better evidence is generated. Pioneering trialists have shown that evaluative studies relevant to oral health advice for people with serious mental illness are possible. Plain language summary Oral heath advice (education and training) for people with serious mental illness Is providing advice about oral health to people with serious mental illness effective? Background People with mental health problems have an increased likelihood of oral disease (affecting the teeth, mouth, and gums) and can require more dental treatment than the general population. Oral health is currently not a priority for service users and mental health professionals, even though tooth decay, discolouration, sensitivity, and gum disease can affect such aspects of everyday life as eating, comfort, appearance, feelings of being accepted by others, and self esteem. While unlikely in itself to be fatal, poor dental health can contribute to other physical health problems such as heart disease. Some medications used to treat serious mental illness can cause side effects that lead to oral disease. Oral health advice from a healthcare professional may encourage people with mental health problems to brush their teeth more regularly, have regular check‐ups with their dentist, and seek dental care if suffering from painful tooth decay, increased sensitivity, or gum disease. Advice may include information or counsel that enables the individual to think about and be aware of their dental health. It should educate and inform, aim at preventing problems, and empower people to take better care of their mouth and teeth. Study characteristics We ran an electronic search in November 2015 for trials that randomised people with serious mental illness to receive either oral health advice, monitoring, or standard care. Three studies meeting the required standards were found and are included in this review. Key results The data available in the included trials suggests that participants receiving oral health education had statistically better plaque index scores than those not receiving oral heath education, but what this actually means clinically is unclear. The trials provided no information about such important issues as number of visits made to dentists or how many times teeth were brushed each day and if there were any potential adverse effects of oral health education. The review authors suggest that although there is currently no real evidence available from trials, it would make sense to follow the guidelines and recommendations put forward by the British Society for Disability and Oral Health working group regarding oral health care for people with mental health problems. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence in the small number of trials available was low to moderate. There is currently a lack of good‐quality evidence available from trials to aid in decision‐making about the overall effectiveness of oral health advice for people with serious mental illness. More good‐quality trials are required to gather better and more concrete evidence. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation.  http://mcpin.org/

AB: Abstract - Background In terms of clinical outcomes, women with schizophrenia seem to fare better then men, but appear more vulnerable to psychotic illness in the period after birth and menopause. As these vulnerable periods to psychosis are associated with estrogen withdrawal, this hormone has been proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effects of estrogens alone or in combination with progesterone, as a sole treatment or as an adjunctive therapy, for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2003) was supplemented with manual reference inspection of all identified studies. Authors of trials were contacted for further material and archive information. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials comparing estrogens with or without progesterone, as a sole or adjunctive treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious, non‐affective psychotic illness. Data collection and analysis We evaluated data independently and analysed on an intention to treat basis. For binary data we calculated the fixed effect relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous non‐skewed data, we calculated weighted mean differences. Main results All available evidence relates to women. Four studies (n=108) compared estrogen only with placebo. Short‐term scores for general mental state showed no significant difference between groups (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD PANSS for 100mcg comparison ‐2.26 CI ‐15.4 to 10.9). Data from all four studies showed overall loss from the studies was low (˜5%), with no significant differences between groups (n=96, 4 RCTs, RR 0.95 CI 0.2 to 6.1). Skewed continuous data from two studies showed no clear differences in ratings of movement disorders. One medium‐term unpublished study (n=14) compared estrogen and progesterone with placebo. Data at six months showed no difference between groups for total scores (n=9, WMD PANSS ‐25.3 CI ‐51 to 0.1). For negative symptoms, results favoured the estrogen and progesterone group (n=9, WMD PANSS negative subscale ‐9.0 CI ‐17 to ‐0.9). For loss to follow up there was no difference between groups (n=10, RR 0.33 CI 0.02 to 6.7). This trial used many cognitive tests and one visual retention test showed statistically significant differences favouring the treatment group: total scores (n=8, WMD ‐3.5 CI ‐5.7 to ‐1.3). Authors' conclusions Adjunctive estrogen with or without progesterone does not appear to offer convincing advantages over placebo. Before any more research is undertaken in this area, all completed and unpublished work should be made available in order to ensure that more trials are justified. Plain language summary Estrogen for schizophrenia The effects of estrogen as sole treatment or adjunctive therapy for those with schizophrenia are unclear. This review found very few relevant trials and data. The majority of results showed no effect and those that did were too weak to draw firm conclusions from. Results from unpublished trials are awaited before recommendations for more research can be made.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling and severe mental disorder, characterised by disturbance in perception, thought, language, affect and motor behaviour. Chlorpromazine and clotiapine are among antipsychotic drugs used for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. Objectives To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost‐effectiveness of chlorpromazine compared with clotiapine for adults with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's Trials Register (last update search 16/01/2016), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the Register. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus clotiapine for schizophrenia. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We have included four studies, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The studies were poor at concealing allocation of treatment and blinding of outcome assessment. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in global and mental state, specific change in negative symptoms, incidence of movement disorder (dyskinesia), leaving the study early for any reason, and costs. All reported data were short‐term (under six months' follow‐up). The trials did not report data for the important outcomes of clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in mental state was reported using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). When chlorpromazine was compared with clotiapine the average improvement scores for mental state using the PANSS total was higher in the clotiapine group (1 RCT, N = 31, MD 11.50 95% CI 9.42 to 13.58, very low‐quality evidence). The average change scores on the PANSS negative sub‐scale were similar between treatment groups (1 RCT, N = 21, MD ‐0.97 95% CI ‐2.76 to 0.82, very low‐quality evidence). There was no clear difference in incidence of dyskinesia (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.13 to 71.15, very low‐quality evidence). Similar numbers of participants left the study early from each treatment group (3 RCTs, N = 158, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.24 to 1.88, very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Clinically important changes in global and mental state were not reported. Only one trial reported the average change in overall mental state; results favour clotiapine but these limited data are very difficult to trust due to methodological limitations of the study. The comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine compared to clotiapine on change in global state remains unanswered. Results in this review suggest chlorpromazine and clotiapine cause similar adverse effects, although again, the quality of evidence for this is poor, making firm conclusions difficult. Plain language summary Direct comparison of two antipsychotics (chlorpromazine versus clotiapine) for treating schizophrenia Review question The aim of this review was to find good quality evidence comparing the efficacy of chlorpromazine versus clotiapine for schizophrenia. Background Chlorpromazine is one of the first antipsychotics to successfully alleviate the symptoms of psychosis. It was introduced in the 1950s and is still one of the most commonly used antipsychotics. However, chlorpromazine can cause serious side effects, particularly unpleasant movement disorders, causing many people with schizophrenia to stop taking chlorpromazine. During the past 70 years newer medications have been developed and most clinicians now have a wide choice of drugs for managing schizophrenia, however, none cure, and all cause some sort of side effect. The choice of treatment is still challenging. Clotiapine is a newer antipsychotic drug, found to be effective for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia and also known to be effective for treating people with schizophrenia who are resistant to other medications, however, like chlorpromazine it can cause serious movement disorders. Searching for evidence Cochrane Schizophrenia's Information Specialist ran an electronic search in January 2016, searching their specialised register for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The search identified six reports. We inspected these reports and found four trials, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 participants that could be included in the review. Main results The four included trials were poorly conducted and did not report data for clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in overall mental state was reported and participants receiving clotiapine had better improvement scores than those receiving chlorpromazine. However the trials also reported data for improvement in the negative symptoms, no difference between the two treatments was found. Clotiapine did not cause more movement disorders than chlorpromazine, and similar numbers of participants left the trials early. Conclusions There is some very low‐quality evidence that favours clotiapine over chlorpromazine for improving overall mental state. For other outcomes, including adverse effects, there is no evidence of a difference between these two antipsychotics. However these data are very difficult to draw conclusions from, only four small trials provided data and these were poorly conducted. We cannot draw conclusions on the comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine versus clotiapine from such data.

AB: Abstract - Background The efficacy of chlorpromazine, a benchmark antipsychotic, has not been fully assessed in direct comparison with different individual antipsychotics. Penfluridol is another old antipsychotic with a long half‐life so one oral dose may last up to one week. This could confer advantage. Objectives To assess the clinical effects of chlorpromazine compared with penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia. Search methods On 31 March 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders. Outcomes of interest were death, service utilisation, global state, mental state, adverse effects and leaving the study early. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The review includes three studies with a total of 130 participants. Short‐term results for hospital admissions showed no clear difference between chlorpromazine and penfluridol (1 RCT, n = 29, RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60,  low‐quality evidence ). No clear difference in the incidence of akathisia was found at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 85, RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.06,  low‐quality evidence ), and similar numbers of participants ‐ nearly half ‐ from each treatment group left the study early (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.77,  low‐quality evidence ). The risk of needing additional antiparkinsonian medication was less in the chlorpromazine group (2 RCTs, n = 74, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95). No useable data reported clinically important change in global or mental state. No data were reported for relapse. No deaths were reported by the trials. Authors' conclusions Only three small studies provided data and the quality of reporting and evidence is low. Limited data indicate the efficacy and adverse effects profiles of chlorpromazine and penfluridol are generally similar. Penfluridol, however, may confer advantage by needing to be given only once per week. Firm conclusions are not possible without good‐quality trials, and where these treatments are used, such trials are justified. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for schizophrenia Review question How effective is the antipsychotic chlorpromazine as a treatment for schizophrenia compared to penfluridol? Background Schizophrenia is serious mental disorder where people experience symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, social withdrawal, decreased motivation and poor emotional response. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine and penfluridol are widely used antipsychotics. However, different antipsychotics have different effects, and knowing the individual effects of different antipsychotics and what particular side effects they cause could help with deciding which antipsychotic to prescribe for an individual with schizophrenia. This review compares chlorpromazine with penfluridol and is one of a series of reviews comparing chlorpromazine directly with other antipsychotics. Searching The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their trials register in March, 2017 for trials that randomised adults with schizophrenia or related disorders to receive either chlorpromazine or penfluridol. Seven records were found and checked by the review authors Evidence found Only three randomised controlled trials, with a total of 130 participants met the review requirements and provided useable data. The quality of evidence available was low, no real difference was noted between chlorpromazine and penfluridol for hospital admissions, incidence of akathisia or numbers of participants leaving the study early. There were no deaths during the trials. We were unable to use the available data for global and mental state due to poor reporting, and no studies reported relapse data. Conclusions We can not make firm conclusions regarding the comparable effectiveness between chlorpromazine and penfluridol with such poor quality data ‐ but penfluridol only needs to be given once per week ‐ which could help the poor adherence to medication common with schizophrenia. Remarkably, for such old drugs, more trials that report high‐quality data are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is common, disabling, costly and under‐treated. There are problems in the current first‐line drug treatment, antidepressants, for moderate or severe depression. There is a body of research that has evaluated the effect of psychostimulants (PS) in the treatment of depression. This has not been reviewed systematically. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of PS in the treatment of depression and to assess adverse events associated with PS. Search methods Databases CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 21/6/2006. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, AMED, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts and the National Health Service Research Register were searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of PS were included. The trial population comprised adults of either sex with a diagnosis of depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted the data independently and assessed trial quality. Meta‐analysis was considered for trials with comparable key characteristics. The primary outcome was depression symptoms, based on a continuous outcome, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), or a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Twenty‐four RCTs were identified. The overall quality of the trials was low. Five drugs were evaluated; dexamphetamine, methylphenidate, methylamphetamine, pemoline and modafinil. Modafinil was evaluated separately as its pharmacology is different to that of the other PS. PS were administered as a monotherapy, adjunct therapy, in oral or intravenous preparation and in comparison with a placebo or an active therapy. Most effects were measured in the short term (up to four weeks). Thirteen trials had some usable data for meta‐analyses. Three trials (62 participants) demonstrated that oral PS, as a monotherapy, significantly reduced short term depressive symptoms in comparison with placebo (SMD ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.40, ‐0.33, with non‐significant heterogeneity. A similar effect was found for fatigue. In the short term PS were acceptable and well tolerated. Tolerance and dependence were under evaluated. No statistically significant difference in depression symptoms was found between modafinil and placebo. Authors' conclusions There is some evidence that in the short‐term, PS reduce symptoms of depression. Whilst this reduction is statistically significant, the clinical significance is less clear. Larger high quality trials with longer follow‐up and evaluation of tolerance and dependence are needed to test the robustness of these findings and, furthermore, to explore which PS may be more beneficial and in which clinical situations they are optimal. Plain language summary Psychostimulants for depression Depression is common and under‐treated. The current first‐line drug treatment for moderate or severe depression is antidepressants, but there are problems with their use. This review evaluated the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of psychostimulants (PS) in the treatment of depression. Twenty‐four RCTs were identified, of which 14 had data for meta‐analysis. Five drugs were evaluated, including dexamphetamine, methylphenidate, methylamphetamine, pemoline and modafinil. Modafinil was evaluated separately as its pharmacology differs from other PS. Three small trials of PS involving a total of 62 participants indicated that oral treatment with PS in the short term (up to four weeks) significantly reduced depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, however, the overall quality of the trials was poor, limiting confidence in the findings. Two trials involving 411 participants compared modafinil against placebo when combined with antidepressant treatment at 6‐8 weeks, and showed a non‐significant difference in reducing depression symptoms. One small trial of 50 participants compared oral modafinil against placebo after 12 weeks of treatment, and also showed a non‐significant difference in reducing depression symptoms. No trials examined the longer‐term effect of PS. Further well conducted trials with long term follow‐up are required to find out which PS may be more effective in the treatment of depression, and whether PS are more effective in certain subgroups of depressed patients.

AB: Abstract - Background Supportive, positive family environments have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with schizophrenia in contrast with family environments that express high levels of criticism, hostility, or over‐involvement, which have poorer outcomes and have more frequent relapses. Forms of psychosocial intervention, designed to promote positive environments and reduce these levels of expressed emotions within families, are now widely used. Objectives To assess the effects of brief family interventions for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All relevant randomised studies that compared brief family‐oriented psychosocial interventions with standard care, focusing on families of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were selected. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we estimated a mean difference (MD) between groups and their 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess quality of evidence for main outcomes of interest and created a 'Summary of findings' table. We assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results Four studies randomising 163 people could be included in the review. It is not clear if brief family intervention reduces the utilisation of health services by patients, as most results are equivocal at long term and only one study reported data for the primary outcomes of interest of hospital admission (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.11,  very low quality evidence ). Data for relapse are also equivocal by medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.43,  low quality evidence ). However, data for the family outcome of understanding of family member significantly favoured brief family intervention (n = 70, 1 RCT, MD 14.90, 95% CI 7.20 to 22.60,  very low quality evidence ). No study reported data for other outcomes of interest including days in hospital; adverse events; medication compliance; quality of life or satisfaction with care; or any economic outcomes. Authors' conclusions The findings of this review are not outstanding due to the size and quality of studies providing data; the analysed outcomes were also minimal, with no meta‐analysis possible. All outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table were rated  low or very low quality evidence . However, the importance of brief family intervention should not be dismissed outright, with the present state of demand and resources available. The designs of such brief interventions could be modified to be more effective with larger studies, which may then have enough power to inform clinical practice. Plain language summary Brief family intervention for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects a persons thoughts, perceptions and emotions. Research has found that the chance of someone with mental illness having a relapse is greater when their family is over‐involved, hostile, critical and dissatisfied ‐ a concept known as 'expressed emotions'. Family interventions have been shown to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia and are now widely used. They are designed to promote positive family environments and reduce levels of expressed emotions within families as well as providing insight into the signs and symptoms of mental illness, so family members can anticipate and help stop relapse. There have been various psychosocial programmes designed over the years, including: counselling groups for family members; family therapy; educational groups for relatives; group therapy for family members; and educational lectures for family members. These are delivered by skilled, trained mental health professionals, who work with the families every two weeks or so, sometimes across considerable time periods, such as one year. Brief family intervention is a form of family intervention where a mental health professional educates the person with schizophrenia and their family members about the illness over a limited number of sessions. This review investigates the effects of brief family intervention for people with schizophrenia, compared to standard or usual care. A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trial register was carried out in July 2012. Four randomised studies, with a total of 163 participants were included. Results were limited, so it is not clear if brief family intervention reduces admission to hospital, decreases people using health services and reduces relapse for people with schizophrenia. The review found some evidence that brief family intervention might increase the understanding of family members about mental illness. However, all main findings are not strong and based on low or very low quality evidence. Despite this, the authors of the review suggest that brief family intervention should not be completely dismissed, as it is in a current state of demand and there are usually resources or local services available for people with mental health problems and their families to participate in as a part of recovery. The authors also suggest that brief family intervention could be improved to be more effective but this would depend on larger and better studies of brief family intervention being carried out, which would help guide good practice and lead to better outcomes for people with schizophrenia. This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray, from RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease. Advanced dementia is characterised by profound cognitive impairment, inability to communicate verbally and complete functional dependence. Usual care of people with advanced dementia is not underpinned universally by a palliative approach. Palliative care has focused traditionally on care of people with cancer but for more than a decade, there have been increased calls worldwide to extend palliative care services to include all people with life‐limiting illnesses in need of specialist care, including people with dementia. Objectives To assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia and to report on the range of outcome measures used. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 4 February 2016. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP trial portal to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible. Selection criteria We searched for randomised (RCT) and non‐randomised controlled trials (nRCT), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series studies evaluating the impact of palliative care interventions for adults with dementia of any type, staged as advanced dementia by a recognised and validated tool. Participants could be people with advanced dementia, their family members, clinicians or paid care staff. We included clinical interventions and non‐clinical interventions. Comparators were usual care or another palliative care intervention. We did not exclude studies on the basis of outcomes measured and recorded all outcomes measured in included studies. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, when required, consulted with the rest of the review team. We independently extracted data and conducted assessment of methodological quality, using standard Cochrane methods. Main results We identified two studies of palliative care interventions for people with advanced dementia. We did not pool data due to the heterogeneity between the two trials in terms of the interventions and the settings. The two studies measured 31 different outcomes, yet they did not measure the same outcome. There are six ongoing studies that we expect to include in future versions of this review. Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible. This and small sample sizes meant that the overall certainty of all the evidence was very low. One individually randomised RCT (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a palliative care team for people with advanced dementia hospitalised for an acute illness. While this trial reported that a palliative care plan was more likely to be developed for participants in the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 25.02), the plan was only adopted for two participants, both in the intervention group, while in hospital. The palliative care plan was more likely to be available on discharge in the intervention group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75). We found no evidence that the intervention affected mortality in hospital (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13), decisions to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital or the clinical care provided during hospital admission, but for the latter, event rates were low and the results were associated with a lot of uncertainty. One cluster RCT (256 participants, each enrolled with a family carer) evaluated the effect of a decision aid on end‐of‐life feeding options on surrogate decision‐makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Data for 90 participants (35% of the original study) met the definition of advanced dementia for this review and were re‐analysed for the purposes of the review. In this subset, intervention surrogates had lower scores for decisional conflict measured on the Decisional Conflict Scale (mean difference ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.01, reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units considered meaningful) and were more likely than participants in the control group to discuss feeding options with a clinician (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64), but imprecision meant that there was significant uncertainty about both results. Authors' conclusions Very little high quality work has been completed exploring palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. There were only two included studies in this review, with variation in the interventions and in the settings that made it impossible to conduct a meta‐analysis of data for any outcome. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. The fact that there are six ongoing studies at the time of this review indicates an increased interest in this area by researchers, which is welcome and needed. Plain language summary Palliative care for people with advanced dementia Review question In this research, we wanted to see if palliative care helps people with advanced dementia or helps their family or carers. We also wanted to describe how researchers tried to measure the effect of palliative care. Background People with advanced dementia have serious memory problems and have problems making simple decisions. They are usually no longer able to communicate by talking. They need a lot of help from their carers. People with advanced dementia can live for a long time. It is very hard to say exactly how long a person with advanced dementia will live. Palliative care (or end‐of‐life care) is a particular way of caring for people who have diseases that cannot be cured. The main aims of palliative care are to reduce pain and to maintain the best possible quality of life as death approaches. Palliative care is used a lot with people with cancer but is not used much for people with advanced dementia. Study characteristics We examined the research published up to January 2016. We found only two suitable studies (189 people), both from the US. We also found six studies that were underway but the results were not yet published. Key results One study found that having a small team of doctors and nurses trained in palliative care made little difference to how people with advanced dementia were treated while in hospital. But, having this special team meant that more people had a palliative care plan when they were discharged from hospital. The other study measured if giving written information to relatives explaining the different methods that can be used to feed people with advanced dementia helped either the relatives or the person. This study found that giving relatives this information made it a little easier for relatives to make decisions about what methods would be used to feed the person with dementia. Certainty of evidence We only found two studies and the two palliative care methods in these studies were very different. We cannot be very certain about how accurate either of these results reported here are, partly because only a small number of people took part in the studies. So from these studies, it is hard to be sure whether palliative care makes a difference to people with advanced dementia. Final thoughts Little research has been done about people with advanced dementia, often because of ethical concerns. However, although it is hard to do research with people with dementia, more well‐designed studies are required to work out how palliative care can be used best in this special population.

AB: Abstract - Background Delirium is a common clinical syndrome defined as alterations in attention with an additional disturbance in cognition or perception, which develop over a short period of time and tend to fluctuate during the course of the episode. Delirium is commonly treated in hospitals or community settings and is often associated with multiple adverse outcomes such as increased cost, morbidity, and even mortality. The first‐line intervention involves a multicomponent non‐pharmacological approach that includes ensuring effective communication and reorientation in addition to providing reassurance or a suitable care environment. There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of delirium. Clinically, however, various medications are employed to provide symptomatic relief, such as antipsychotic medications and cholinesterase inhibitors, among others. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors for treating people with established delirium in a non‐intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Search methods We searched ALOIS, which is the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 26 October 2017. We also cross‐checked the reference lists of included studies to identify any potentially eligible trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished, reported in English or Chinese, which compared cholinesterase inhibitors to placebo or other drugs intended to treat people with established delirium in a non‐ICU setting. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were duration of delirium, severity of delirium, and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were use of rescue medications, persistent cognitive impairment, length of hospitalisation, institutionalisation, mortality, cost of intervention, leaving the study early, and quality of life. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); for continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE to generate a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included one study involving 15 participants from the UK. The included participants were diagnosed with delirium based on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) criteria. Eight males and seven females were included, with a mean age of 82.5 years. Seven of the 15 participants had comorbid dementia at baseline. The risk of bias was low in all domains. The study compared rivastigmine with placebo. We did not find any clear differences between the two groups in terms of duration of delirium (MD ‐3.6, 95% CI ‐15.6 to 8.4), adverse events (nausea, RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.29), use of rescue medications (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.1), mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.56), and leaving the study early (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.07 to 11.54). Evidence was not available regarding the severity of delirium, persistent cognitive impairment, length of hospitalisation, cost of intervention, or other predefined secondary outcomes. The quality of evidence is low due to the very small sample size. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of delirium in non‐ICU settings. No clear benefits or harms associated with cholinesterase inhibitors were observed when compared with placebo due to the lack of data. More trials are required. Plain language summary Cholinesterase inhibitors for people with delirium, not including those in intensive care units Background During a period of illness, people can develop symptoms of confusion and altered consciousness, which is known as delirium. Compared to patients with no delirium, patients with delirium spend a longer time in hospital and are less likely to survive their illness. Treatment of delirium should focus on good care of the underlying illness and strategies such as reorientation of the patient. However, medication‐based treatments are still often used. Medications used for treating the symptoms of dementia (cholinesterase inhibitors) may have a role in treating delirium. Review question We wished to find out if treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitors reduces the severity or duration of delirium. We were also interested in side effects from cholinesterase inhibitors. Delirium is often seen in severe illnesses that require high levels of medical and nursing care, for example in the intensive care unit. In this review we focused on studies of patients who were not in a high‐level care setting. Study characteristics We found one trial from the UK, which included 15 participants with delirium. The average age of the participants was 82.5 years; eight participants were male and seven were female. Seven participants also had a history of dementia. This trial compared rivastigmine (a type of cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia) with an inactive treatment (placebo). Key results The trial did not show any difference in effect between those participants given rivastigmine and those given placebo. The study was conducted and reported appropriately, but the small number of participants limits any conclusions that could be made about rivastigmine as a treatment for delirium.

AB: Abstract - Background First generation 'typical' antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment up until the introduction of the second generation 'atypical' antipsychotics such as risperidone and olanzapine. Typical and atypical antipsychotics do provide a treatment response for most people with schizophrenia, whether a reduction in psychotic episodes or a lessening in the severity of their illness. However, a proportion of people still do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication. Additionally, atypical and especially typical antipsychotics are associated with serious adverse effects, which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse. In this review we examine the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo. Objectives To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2008) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. For this update, we carried out an initial search in May 2007 and a second search in August 2008. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed‐effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a fixed‐effect model. Main results Despite the fact that 2585 people participated in nine randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment; economic outcomes or cognitive functioning. In general, study attrition was very large for all studies over four weeks' duration. There was high attrition in most of the included studies. Fewer people left the aripiprazole group compared with those in the placebo group (n = 2585, 9 RCTs, RR 0.73 CI 0.60 to 0.87). Compared with placebo, aripiprazole significantly decreased relapse in both the short (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.45 to 0.77) and medium term (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.53 to 0.81). It also produced better compliance with study protocol (n = 2275, 8 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.59 to 0.93). Aripiprazole may decrease prolactin levels below those expected from placebo (n = 305, 2 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.11 to 0.37). Insomnia (˜23%) and headaches (˜15%) were commonly reported in both groups, with no significant difference. Authors' conclusions Aripiprazole may be effective for the treatment of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole has a lower risk of raised prolactin and prolongation of the QTc interval. Clearly reported pragmatic short‐, medium‐ and long‐term randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to determine its position in everyday clinical practice. Plain language summary Aripiprazole versus placebo for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is one of the major psychiatric disorders; it affects individuals' thinking, perception, affect and behaviour. It can occur in around 1% of the population. Aripiprazole is one of the newer antipsychotic medications introduced for the treatment of schizophrenia. When compared with placebo, people taking aripiprazole had fewer relapses, smaller numbers of participants left study early, and needed less additional antipsychotic medications. Insomnia and headache were the most commonly reported side effects, but were not much difference to placebo. Side effects such as akathisia, nausea and weight gain occurred more in the aripripazole group as compared to placebo. There has been a worry with newer antipsychotic medications and their effect on conductance problems in the heart, impaired glucose levels and excessive production of prolactin (which can cause unpleasant breast pain and secretion). On the limited evidence available (due to participants leaving early and fewer studies) aripiprazole appears to have a similar effect to that of placebo. The overall finding on its efficacy in treating schizophrenia is unchanged from those found in the original review.

AB: Abstract - Background Pericyazine is a 3‐cyano‐10 (3‐4'‐hydroxypiperidinopropyl) phenothiazine. It is overall pharmacologically similar with chlorpromazine, though particularly sedating. Dopamine receptor subtype analysis has not been performed for pericyazine, but the drug appears to induce greater noradrenergic than dopaminergic blockade. Compared to chlorpromazine, pericyazine reportedly has more potent antiemetic, antiserotonin, and anticholinergic activity. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effects and safety of pericyazine in comparison with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2013) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on pericyazine for schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia‐like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders). We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently from included papers by at least two review authors. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were calculated. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge quality of evidence. Main results We could only include five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980. Most of the included studies did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, details of blinding and we could not assess the impact of attrition due to poor reporting. For the primary outcome of Global state ‐ not improved, the confidence interval was compatible with a small benefit and increased risk of not improving with pericyazine compared with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 122, RR 1.24 CI 0.93 to 1.66,  very low quality of evidence ) or atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.97 CI 0.67 to 1.42,  very low quality of evidence ). When compared with typical antipsychotics relapse was only experienced by one person taking pericyazine (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 2.59 CI 0.11 to 61.75,  very low quality of evidence ). Pericyazine was associated with more extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics (3 RCTs, n = 163, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80,  very low quality of evidence ) and atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 2.69 CI 1.35 to 5.36,  very low quality of evidence ). The estimated risk of leaving the study early for specific reasons was imprecise for the comparisons of pericyazine with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 71, RR 0.46 CI 0.11 to 1.90,  very low quality of evidence ), and with atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.13 CI 0.01 to 2.42,  very low quality of evidence ). Authors' conclusions On the basis of very low quality evidence we are unable to determine the effects of pericyazine in comparison with typical or atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, there is some evidence that pericyazine may be associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than other antipsychotics, and again this was judged to be  very low quality  evidence. Large, robust studies are still needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Plain language summary Pericyazine for the treatment of schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The first line and mainstay of treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. These antipsychotic drugs can be grouped into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). Pericyazine is a relatively old antipsychotic formulated in 1961. Some studies have suggested that it may be of more benefit than other antipsychotic drugs. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of pericyazine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared to older and newer antipsychotics.A search for studies was carried out in 2013 and five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980 were found and included in the review. The quality of evidence was rated by the authors to be  very low , and their results were imprecise for many outcomes where they compared pericyazine and other older and newer antipsychotic drugs. The evidence is inadequate to determine whether pericyazine is better than other antipsychotics. The results of the analysis for the outcome of improvement were imprecise and the authors could not be certain that more people who took pericyazine were found to have not improved compared with those who took typical antipsychotics. More side effects, such as involuntary shaking, tremors, restlessness and spasms, were experienced by people who took pericyazine than other typical or atypical antipsychotics. These side effects are very unpleasant and the increased occurrence of them compared to other antipsychotics is an important finding considering pericyazine may not have additional benefits for the symptoms of schizophrenia. No studies reported outcomes on satisfaction of treatment or cost effectiveness, which require attention. This lack of evidence leaves people with schizophrenia, mental health professionals and policy makers with little information on the benefits, hazards or problems of pericyazine. Outcomes on the cost of care and satisfaction with treatment should be included in future trials which should also be larger, better conducted, and fully reported.

AB: Abstract - Background Postnatal depression is a medical condition that affects many women and the development of their infants. There is a lack of evidence for treatment and prevention strategies that are safe for mothers and infants. Certain dietary deficiencies in a pregnant or postnatal woman's diet may cause postnatal depression. By correcting these deficiencies postnatal depression could be prevented in some women. Specific examples of dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include: omega‐3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s‐adenosyl‐L‐methionine, cobalamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin, vitamin D and calcium. Objectives To assess the benefits of dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression either in the antenatal period, postnatal period, or both. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, involving women who were pregnant or who had given birth in the previous six weeks, who were not depressed or taking antidepressants at the commencement of the trials. The trials could use as intervention any dietary supplementation alone or in combination with another treatment compared with any other preventive treatment, or placebo, or standard clinical care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias for the two included studies. Two review authors extracted data and the data were checked for accuracy. Main results We included two randomised controlled trials. One trial compared oral 100 microgram (µg) selenium yeast tablets with placebo, taken from the first trimester until birth. The trial randomised 179 women but outcome data were only provided for 85 women. Eighty‐three women were randomised to each arm of the trial. Sixty‐one women completed the selenium arm, 44 of whom completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In the placebo arm, 64 women completed the trial, 41 of whom completed an EPDS. This included study (n = 85) found selenium had an effect on EPDS scores but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). There was a mean difference (MD) of ‐1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.92 to 0.12) of the self‐reported EPDS completed by participants within eight weeks of delivery. There was a high risk of attrition bias due to a large proportion of women withdrawing from the study or not completing an EPDS. This included study did not report on any of the secondary outcomes of this review. The other trial compared docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with placebo. The trial randomised 126 women at risk of postpartum depression to three arms: 42 were allocated to EPA, 42 to DHA, and 42 to placebo. Three women in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm, and one woman in the placebo arm were lost to follow‐up. Women who were found to have major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, current substance abuse or dependence, suicidal ideation or schizophrenia at recruitment were excluded from the study. The women who discontinued the intervention (five in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm and seven in the placebo arm) were included in the intention‐to‐treat analysis, while those who were lost to follow‐up were not. Women received supplements or placebo from recruitment at a gestational age of 12 to 20 weeks until their final review visit six to eight weeks postpartum. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score at the fifth visit (six to eight weeks postpartum). No benefit was found for EPA‐rich fish oil (MD 0.70, 95% CI ‐1.78 to 3.18) or DHA‐rich fish oil supplementation (MD 0.90, 95% CI ‐1.33 to 3.13) in preventing postpartum depression. No difference was found in the effect on postnatal depression comparing EPA with DHA (MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐2.61 to 2.21). No benefit or significant effect was found in terms of the secondary outcomes of the presence of major depressive disorder at six to eight weeks postpartum, the number of women who commenced antidepressants, maternal estimated blood loss at delivery or admission of neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to conclude that selenium, DHA or EPA prevent postnatal depression. There is currently no evidence to recommend any other dietary supplement for prevention of postnatal depression. Plain language summary Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression Postnatal depression is a common condition that affects women and may impact on their babies. Common symptoms of postnatal depression include fluctuations in mood, mood changes, suicidal ideation and preoccupation with infant well‐being ranging from over‐concern to frank delusions. There is currently not much evidence regarding interventions that might prevent or treat postnatal depression. A diet lacking in certain vitamins, minerals or other nutrients may cause postnatal depression in some women. Correcting this deficiency with dietary supplements might therefore prevent postnatal depression. Examples of possible dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include omega‐3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s‐adenosyl‐L‐methionine, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), B6 (pyridoxine), B2 (riboflavin), vitamin D and calcium. This review identified two randomised controlled studies. One study examined the effect of selenium supplements taken by women from the first trimester to birth in preventing postnatal depression. This study had a high risk of bias because of women withdrawing or not completing their self‐scoring system for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). It may also have been difficult to ensure that the women took their supplements because of concerns that exist about taking supplements during pregnancy. More high‐quality studies would be required to confirm any benefit in preventing postnatal depression using selenium. This review also identified one randomised controlled study that compared docosahexanoic and eicosapentaenoic acid to placebo in women at risk of postpartum depression. This study found that neither docosahexanoic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid prevented postpartum depression. Overall, there is not enough evidence at this stage to recommend selenium, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or any other dietary supplement for the prevention of postnatal depression. Unfortunately there were no other studies of other dietary supplements that met our selection criteria. Other dietary supplements need to be studied in trials where depressed women are excluded from entry to determine if supplements prevent postnatal depression.

AB: Abstract - Background In some countries extracts of the plant  Hypericum perforatum  L. (popularly called St. John's wort) are widely used for treating patients with depressive symptoms. Objectives To investigate whether extracts of hypericum are more effective than placebo and as effective as standard antidepressants in the treatment of major depression; and whether they have fewer adverse effects than standard antidepressant drugs. Search methods Trials were searched in computerised databases, by checking bibliographies of relevant articles, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers. Selection criteria Trials were included if they: (1) were randomised and double‐blind; (2) included patients with major depression; (3) compared extracts of St. John's wort with placebo or standard antidepressants; (4) included clinical outcomes assessing depressive symptoms. Data collection and analysis At least two independent reviewers extracted information from study reports. The main outcome measure for assessing effectiveness was the responder rate ratio (the relative risk of having a response to treatment). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of patients dropping out due to adverse effects. Main results A total of 29 trials (5489 patients) including 18 comparisons with placebo and 17 comparisons with synthetic standard antidepressants met the inclusion criteria. Results of placebo‐controlled trials showed marked heterogeneity. In nine larger trials the combined response rate ratio (RR) for hypericum extracts compared with placebo was 1.28 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10 to 1.49) and from nine smaller trials was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.87). Results of trials comparing hypericum extracts and standard antidepressants were statistically homogeneous. Compared with tri‐ or tetracyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), respectively, RRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.15; 5 trials) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.11; 12 trials). Both in placebo‐controlled trials and in comparisons with standard antidepressants, trials from German‐speaking countries reported findings more favourable to hypericum. Patients given hypericum extracts dropped out of trials due to adverse effects less frequently than those given older antidepressants (odds ratio (OR) 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.46) or SSRIs (OR 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34‐0.83). Authors' conclusions The available evidence suggests that the hypericum extracts tested in the included trials a) are superior to placebo in patients with major depression; b) are similarly effective as standard antidepressants; c) and have fewer side effects than standard antidepressants. The association of country of origin and precision with effects sizes complicates the interpretation. Plain language summary St. John's wort for treating depression. Depression is characterised by depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities and a variety of other symptoms for periods longer than two weeks. Extracts of St. John's wort (botanical name  Hypericum perforatum L. ) are prescribed widely for the treatment of depression. We have reviewed 29 studies in 5489 patients with depression that compared treatment with extracts of St. John's wort for 4 to 12 weeks with placebo treatment or standard antidepressants. The studies came from a variety of countries, tested several different St. John's wort extracts, and mostly included patients suffering from mild to moderately severe symptoms. Overall, the St. John's wort extracts tested in the trials were superior to placebo, similarly effective as standard antidepressants, and had fewer side effects than standard antidepressants. However, findings were more favourable to St. John's wort extracts in studies form German‐speaking countries where these products have a long tradition and are often prescribed by physicians, while in studies from other countries St. John's wort extracts seemed less effective. This differences could be due to the inclusion of patients with slightly different types of depression, but it cannot be ruled out that some smaller studies from German‐speaking countries were flawed and reported overoptimistic results. Patients suffering from depressive symptoms who wish to use a St. John's wort product should consult a health professional. Using a St. John's wort extract might be justified, but important issues should be taken into account: St. John's wort products available on the market vary to a great extent. The results of this review apply only to the preparations tested in the studies included, and possibly to extracts with similar characteristics. Side effects of St. John's wort extracts are usually minor and uncommon. However, the effects of other drugs might be significantly compromised.

AB: Abstract - Background Catatonia is a debilitating disorder of movement and volition associated with schizophrenia and some other mental illnesses. People with catatonia are more likely to require hospitalisation and highly supervised care than those without the disorder. They also have an increased risk of secondary complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration. The mainstay of treatment has been drug therapies and electroconvulsive therapy. Objectives To compare the effects of benzodiazepines with other drugs, placebo or electroconvulsive therapy for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses (SMIs). Search methods We updated our previous search (28 February 2007) by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (9 November 2016; 6 February 2019). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. We also manually searched reference lists from studies selected by the search. Selection criteria All controlled clinical trials that randomised people who have schizophrenia or other similar SMI and experiencing catatonia to receive benzodiazepines or another relevant treatment. We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported usable data. We excluded those not meeting our inclusion criteria or those not reporting usable data. We contacted authors when we required further information; and if we received no response, we put those studies aside as 'awaiting assessment'. Data collection and analysis Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a fixed‐effect model. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included study and generated a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The searches found 130 citations, from which we could identify 22 possibly relevant studies. From these, we could only include one study. This study had a relatively small sample size of 17 participants who received lorazepam or oxazepam and were drug free for one week before the trial started. The only usable data reported by this study were clinically important change in symptoms of catatonia measured as 50% improvement on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). There was no difference in the numbers of participants showing a clinically important change in their catatonic symptoms (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.16; participants = 17; studies = 1; very low quality evidence). No data were reported for other important outcomes of hospital stay, clinically important change in satisfaction with care, global state, adverse effects or general functioning We did find a few studies meeting our inclusion criteria but they reported no usable data. We had to exclude these. Although poorly reported, these studies do illustrate that relevant studies have been undertaken — they are not impossible to design and conduct. Authors' conclusions Analysis of the results from this review, which was a head‐to‐head comparison of two benzodiazepine monotherapies, does not show a clear difference in effect. No data were available for benzodiazepines compared to placebo or standard care. The lack of usable data and very low quality of data available makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions and further studies with a high‐quality methodology and reporting are required in order to determine more definitively the outcomes associated with benzodiazepine use in the clinical management of catatonia in persons with schizophrenia and other SMI. Plain language summary Benzodiazepines for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or similar serious mental illness Review question   Are the group of drugs called benzodiazepines an effective and tolerable treatment for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses? Background   Catatonia is a debilitating condition that is characterised by diminished, excessive or peculiar movement and activity as well as diminished engagement with the social and physical environment. It can occur when a person has a number of different psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (an enduring mental illness whose hallmark is an altered perception of reality); and less frequently with medical conditions. Some of the other serious mental disorders that are associated with catatonia include bipolar disorder (an illness in which there are extremes of disturbed mood) and depression (another mood disorder characterized by low mood). Benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of catatonia, but there is no good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning their effectiveness. Searching for evidence   The Information Specialist from Cochrane Schizophrenia ran electronic searches of the group's specialised register (the most recent in February 2019) for trials that randomised people with catatonia occurring in conjunction with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses to receive either benzodiazepines or any of the following: other drugs, placebo, or electroconvulsive therapy. One hundred and thirty records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found   One trial was found in the search which met the review requirements and provided limited, very low quality usable data for one outcome only. This trial compared two benzodiazepines (lorazepam vs oxazepam) and found no clear difference between these two treatments for improvement in the symptoms of catatonia for people who have catatonia and schizophrenia or similar serious mental illness. Conclusions   There is insufficient high quality evidence available to answer the review question. More high quality research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background There is accumulating evidence that progressive changes in brain structure and function take place as schizophrenia unfolds. Among many possible candidates, oxidative stress may be one of the mediators of neuroprogression, grey matter loss and subsequent cognitive and functional impairment. Antioxidants are exogenous or endogenous molecules that mitigate any form of oxidative stress or its consequences. They may act from directly scavenging free radicals to increasing anti‐oxidative defences. There is evidence that current treatments impact oxidative pathways and may to some extent reverse pro‐oxidative states in schizophrenia. The existing literature, however, indicates that these treatments do not fully restore the deficits in antioxidant levels or restore levels of oxidants in schizophrenia. As such, there has been interest in developing interventions aimed at restoring this oxidative balance beyond the benefits of antipsychotics in this direction. If antioxidants are to have a place in the treatment of this serious condition, the relevant and up‐to‐date information should be available to clinicians and investigators. Objectives To evaluate the effect of antioxidants as add‐on treatments to standard antipsychotic medication for improving acute psychotic episodes and core symptoms, and preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We ran this search in November 2010, and again on 8 January 2015. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with schizophrenia who had been allocated to either a substance with antioxidant potential or to a placebo as an adjunct to standard antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The review includes 22 RCTs of varying quality and sample size studying  Ginkgo biloba , N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), allopurinol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vitamin C, vitamin E or selegiline. Median follow‐up was eight weeks. Only three studies including a minority of the participants reported our  a priori  selected primary outcome of clinically important response. Short‐term data for this outcome (measured as at least 20% improvement in scores on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) were similar (3 RCTs, n = 229, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.12,  low quality evidence ). Studies usually reported only endpoint psychopathology rating scale scores. Psychotic symptoms were lower in those using an adjunctive antioxidant according to the PANSS ( 7 RCTS, n = 584, MD ‐6.00, 95% CI ‐10.35 to ‐1.65,  very low quality evidence ) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (8 RCTS, n = 843, MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐5.63 to ‐0.78,  low quality evidence ). There was no overall short‐term difference in leaving the study early (16 RCTs, n = 1584, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11,  moderate quality evidence ), or in general functioning (2 RCTs, n = 52, MD ‐1.11, 95% CI ‐8.07 to 5.86,  low quality evidence ). Adverse events were generally poorly reported. Three studies reported useable data for 'any serious adverse effect', results were equivocal (3 RCTs, n = 234, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.27,  low quality evidence ). No evidence was available for relapse, quality of life or service use. Authors' conclusions Although 22 trials could be included in this review, the evidence provided is limited and mostly not relevant to clinicians or consumers. Overall, although there was low risk of attrition and selective data reporting bias within the trials, the trials themselves were not adequately powered and need more substantial follow‐up periods. There is a need for larger trials with longer periods of follow‐up to be conducted. Outcomes should be meaningful for those with schizophrenia, and include measures of improvement and relapse (not just rating scale scores), functioning and quality of life and acceptability and, importantly, safety data. Plain language summary Antioxidants as add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia Antioxidants are substances that protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals (causing oxidative stress). It is well known that adding antioxidant‐rich fruits and vegetables to your daily diet will strengthen your ability to fight infection and disease. There is recent evidence that progressive brain changes take place as schizophrenia unfolds. Among many possible explanations, oxidative stress may be one of the factors contributing to the deterioration of the brain and its grey matter, leading to difficulties in people’s thinking and everyday functioning. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effect of antioxidants as an add‐on treatment to standard antipsychotic medication. In particular, by reducing (or lessening) psychotic episodes and core symptoms, and preventing relapse Searches for randomised trials were run in 2010 and 2012, review authors found 22 relevant trials that randomised a total of 2041 people with schizophrenia. The trials compared the effects of taking a variety of antioxidants (allopurinol,  Ginkgo biloba , N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), selegiline, vitamins C and E) compared with placebo. Most results showed no real differences between the antioxidants and placebo although there was evidence  Ginkgo biloba  had a positive effect on psychotic symptoms in the short term. The quality of this evidence was moderate. However, overall, the trials suffered from a lack of real‐world outcomes, such as clinical response, rates of relapse, quality of life, functioning, safety and satisfaction or acceptability of treatment. Adverse effects were also poorly reported with some studies not providing any data for adverse effects. Ginkgo biloba  and NAC emerged from the trials as the most promising, so should have priority in the design of future trials that are larger, longer and better reported than the 22 studies available at the present time.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia. Long‐acting depot injections of drugs such as bromperidol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long‐term maintenance treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of depot bromperidol versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Search methods For this 2012 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2012). Selection criteria We sought all randomised trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where depot bromperidol, oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations. Primary outcomes were clinically significant change in global function, service utilisation outcomes (hospital admission, days in hospital), relapse. Data collection and analysis For the 2011 update MP independently extracted data, CEA carried out the reliability check. We calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. For the 2012 update, data collection and analysis was not carried out as no new studies were found. Main results The 2012 search found no new studies, we have therefore included no new trials in this 2012 update. The number of included trials remain 4 RCTs, total n = 117. A single, small study of six months' duration compared bromperidol decanoate with placebo injection. Similar numbers left the study before completion (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.6) and there were no clear differences between bromperidol decanoate and placebo for a list of adverse effects (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR akathisia 2.0 CI 0.21 to 18.69, RR increased weight 3.0 CI 0.14 to 65.9, RR tremor 0.33 CI 0.04 to 2.69). When bromperidol decanoate was compared with fluphenazine depot, we found no important change on global outcome (n = 30, RR no clinical important improvement 1.50 CI 0.29 to 7.73). People allocated to fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate had fewer relapses than those given bromperidol decanoate (n = 77, RR 3.92 Cl 1.05 to 14.60, NNH 6 CI 2 to 341). People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate, but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group more frequent than those taking other depot preparation due to any cause (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 2.17 CI 1.00 to 4.73). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n = 47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01). The incidence of movement disorders was similar in both depot groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.47 to 1.17). Authors' conclusions Minimal poorly reported trial data suggests that bromperidol decanoate may be better than placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. If bromperidol decanoate is available it may be a viable choice, especially when there are reasons not to use fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. Well‐conducted and reported randomised trials are needed to inform practice. Plain language summary Depot bromperidol decanoate for schizophrenia Bromperidol decanoate is used as a long‐acting antipsychotic medication in at least Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. The preparation seems to be less potent than other depot antipsychotics (such as fluphenazine and haloperidol decanoate) and better than placebo injection. However, this older antipsychotic preparation has very few data from good quality studies and new trials are needed to fully understand the effects of this preparation.

AB: Abstract - Background Chlorpromazine, a widely available and inexpensive antipsychotic drug, is considered the benchmark treatment for schizophrenia worldwide. Metiapine, a dibenzothiazepine derivative, has been reported to have potent antipsychotic characteristics. However, no evidence currently exists on the effectiveness of chlorpromazine in treatment of people with schizophrenia compared to metiapine, a newer antipsychotic. Objectives To compare the effect of chlorpromazine versus metiapine for the treatment of people with schizophrenia Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials in November 2015 and 2016. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on chlorpromazine versus metiapine for adults with schizophrenia. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included three studies randomising 161 people with schizophrenia. Data were available for only two of our seven prestated main outcomes. Clinically important improvement in global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups (2 RCTs, n = 120, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47,  very low quality evidence ) and numbers of participants with parkinsonism at eight weeks were similar (2 RCTs, n = 70, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.03,  very low quality evidence ). There were no useable data available for the other key outcomes of clinically important improvement in mental state, readmission due to relapse, satisfaction with treatment, aggressive or violent behaviour, or cost of care. Authors' conclusions Chlorpromazine has been the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia for decades, yet available evidence comparing this drug to metiapine fails to provide high‐quality trial based data. However, the need to determine whether metiapine is more or less effective than chlorpromazine seems to be lacking in clinical relevance and future research on this comparison seems unlikely. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus metiapine for schizophrenia The aim of this review was to find good quality evidence for comparing the efficacy of chlorpromazine versus metiapine for schizophrenia. Background Schizophrenia is a common disabling and enduring mental illness worldwide. People with schizophrenia often experience positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms such as apathy (lack of interest) and loss of emotion. Antipsychotic medicines have been successful for treating the positive symptoms but the negative symptoms remain difficult to treat and usually do not respond to routine antipsychotics. In addition, antipsychotic medicines often have unpleasant side effects. Chlorpromazine is a widely available and inexpensive antipsychotic introduced in the 1950s and considered the benchmark treatment for schizophrenia worldwide. Initial research indicated that chlorpromazine helped global improvement and was effective at preventing relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). However, some of chlorpromazine's side effects, particularly incidence of movement disorders, are reported as severe or debilitating. Metiapine is a relatively newer antipsychotic medicine, reporting to be effective at treating the symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer side effects. However, there is currently no good quality information concerning metiapine's effectiveness directly compared to chlorpromazine. Searching for evidence In November 2015, the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group searched their specialised register for relevant clinical trials. The search identified four reports. We inspected these reports and found they referred to three trials, randomising people with schizophrenia to receive chlorpromazine or metiapine. Main results Our review now includes three studies with 161 participants. The studies revealed no real differences between chlorpromazine and metiapine for improvement in global state or incidence of parkinsonism (an umbrella term for symptoms such as tremor (shaking), bradykinesia (slow movement), rigidity (stiffness), and postural instability (difficulty in balancing). No data were reported for our other main areas of interest: mental state, service use, satisfaction with treatment, behaviour or cost of care. Conclusions We cannot draw firm conclusions from the data provided. The number of studies and number of participants in each study is small, all studies are also short term. Therefore, we rated the reported evidence as very low quality. However, metiapine is not a highly prescribed or used antipsychotic medicine, so although our evidence is poor, it probably will remain the best available evidence as it is unlikely new trials comparing metiapine with chlorpromazine will be conducted in the future.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not respond to an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, one treatment strategy could be to increase the antipsychotic dose; and another strategy could be to switch to a different antipsychotic drug. Objectives To examine the efficacy of increasing the antipsychotic dose versus switching the antipsychotic drug in the treatment of non‐responsive people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose versus switching to a different antipsychotic drug for people with schizophrenia who have not responded to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We include one RCT with relevant data on 29 participants in this review. The trial had a parallel design and was double‐blind, but blinding procedures were not described. The trial included people who were non‐responsive to fluphenazine 20 mg/day administered for 4 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to continuing treatment with fluphenazine 20 mg/day, increasing the dose to fluphenazine 80 mg/day or switching to haloperidol 20 mg/day for four additional weeks. Data were reported only for 47 out of 58 initially randomised participants. The trial was published in 1993. The fact that only one RCT with a small sample size (N = 29) was included in the analysis limits the quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the three available outcomes: global state (number of participants with clinically relevant response (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.17 to 15.99,  very low quality evidence ); general mental state (endpoint score, BPRS total) (MD 2.00, 95% CI −4.20 to 8.20,  very low quality evidence ); and negative symptoms (endpoint score, SANS) (MD 3.40, 95% CI −12.56 to 19.36). No data were reported for leaving the study early, adverse effects, time in hospital, quality of life, satisfaction with care and functioning. Authors' conclusions There is extremely limited evidence and no clear conclusions can be drawn. There is an urgent need for further trials in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Plain language summary Increasing antipsychotic dose versus switching to a different antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to initial treatment Review question If a person with schizophrenia does not initially respond to an antipsychotic, is increasing the dose of this antipsychotic more effective, and safer, compared with switching to another antipsychotic? Background Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia do not respond fully (i.e. symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations still remain) with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians can consider increasing the antipsychotic dose beyond regular thresholds or switching to a different antipsychotic drug in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. The evidence surrounding the optimal treatment strategy is scarce. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia ran an electronic search (up to 30 March 2017) for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia who were not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment to receive either an increased antipsychotic dose or switch to a different antipsychotic drug. Nine hundred and two records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found Only one trial met the review requirements and provided usable data. Data were reported for the number of participants who responded to treatment, the general mental state of participants at endpoint of the trial and the presence of negative symptoms at endpoint. There were no data available for any other outcome. No clear difference between increasing the dose of the antipsychotic drug and switching to a different antipsychotic was shown. The available evidence was extremely limited and of very low quality. Conclusions The results of the present review show that there is no good‐quality evidence to help clinicians decide between increasing the antipsychotic dose or switching to a different antipsychotic drug for people not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Therefore, no clear conclusions can be drawn. Larger, well‐designed trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Pharmacological treatments are the principal intervention for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to control symptoms and maintain psychosocial functioning. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions may help to improve the patient's condition and the course of the illness. Family interventions are deserving of special attention, since they may help to relieve the burden of care borne by relatives and caregivers, which in turn may facilitate the task of supporting the patient. Objectives The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of family interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder compared with no intervention and other forms of intervention. Search methods We searched the electronic databases CCDANRCT‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References on 1/8/2007, CENTRAL (2006‐3), MEDLINE (2006), EMBASE (2006) and LILACS (2006), and searched the reference lists of included studies. We also made personal contact with authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. Participants were people with bipolar disorder and their relatives or caregivers; family psychosocial interventions of any type were considered; primary outcomes were changes in the status of symptoms and relapse rates. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Quality assessment of included studies was carried out. The findings were presented descriptively. Where there were sufficient studies, dichotomous data were combined using relative risk, and continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference, with their 95% CIs. Main results Seven RCTs were included in the review, involving a total of 393 participants. All of the included studies assessed psychoeducational methods, and one study also assessed a type of systems psychotherapy. In all trials, participants continued to receive pharmacotherapy treatment. Due to the diversity of interventions, outcome measures and endpoints used across studies, it was not possible to perform meta‐analyses for primary outcomes. Five studies compared a variety of family interventions, involving carers, families or spouses, against no intervention, with individual findings indicating no significant added effect for family interventions. Three studies compared one type or modality of family intervention against another family intervention, with inconsistent findings. Authors' conclusions To date there is only a small and heterogeneous body of evidence on the effectiveness of family oriented approaches for bipolar disorder, and it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions to support their use as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. Further well designed RCTs should be a research priority. Plain language summary Family interventions for bipolar disorder Drug treatments are the primary treatment for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to manage the disorder. Studies on psychosocial interventions for mental disorders such as schizophrenia and anxiety show that they are effective treatments. Reports in the literature suggest that they may be useful for people with bipolar disorder as well. The role of the family is important in the care of people with bipolar disorder, with effective family functioning helping to maintain a person's psychological balance. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of any psychosocial family intervention for people with bipolar disorder and/or their families and carers. Seven randomised controlled trials (393 participants) were included in the review, all of which evaluated psychoeducational interventions. Five studies compared family interventions against no treatment, and three studies compared one type or delivery of family intervention against another family intervention. Differences in the interventions, outcome measures and end points used in the trials did not allow us to perform a meta‐analysis. Whilst results from individual studies did not suggest a significant effect for family interventions when added to drug therapy, the studies provide insufficient evidence to draw conclusions which can be generalised to everyday practice. Further research using appropriate randomised controlled trial methodology and evaluating family interventions other than psychoeducation is called for in this under‐researched and important topic.

AB: Abstract - Background Current guidance suggests that we should monitor the physical health of people with serious mental illness, and there has been a significant financial investment over recent years to provide this. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of physical health monitoring, compared with standard care for people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (October 2009, update in October 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on physical health monitoring versus standard care, or comparing i) self monitoring versus monitoring by a healthcare professional; ii) simple versus complex monitoring; iii) specific versus non‐specific checks; iv) once only versus regular checks; or v) different guidance materials. Data collection and analysis Initially, review authors (GT, AC, SM) independently screened the search results and identified three studies as possibly fulfilling the review's criteria. On examination, however, all three were subsequently excluded. Forty‐two additional citations were identified in October 2012 and screened by two review authors (JX and MW), 11 of which underwent full screening. Main results No relevant randomised trials which assess the effectiveness of physical health monitoring in people with serious mental illness have been completed. We identified one ongoing study. Authors' conclusions There is still no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute current guidance and practice. Guidance and practice are based on expert consensus, clinical experience and good intentions rather than high quality evidence. Plain language summary Physical health care monitoring for people with serious mental illness People with mental health problems often have complex and long‐term difficulties with their physical health such as weight gain, smoking and heart problems. They sometimes do not take care of themselves, have inactive lifestyles and may not be able to cope with daily life or work. People with mental health problems have higher rates of diabetes, lung disease, cancer, heart problems, HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases. Physical health care monitoring can take a variety of forms from simple checks carried out by the person themselves to complex specific health checks carried out by health professionals. Monitoring helps identify current health problems and also anticipate future health problems. In August 2006 the United Kingdom’s Department of Health issued guidance on how to provide better care for the physical health needs of people with serious mental illness. Spearhead Trusts, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and other organisations all promoted the use of physical health care monitoring for people with mental health problems. This review intended to find evidence to support this guidance. The authors’ conclude that current guidance and practice on physical health monitoring lacks a firm basis in research and there is little evidence to support this growing trend. They based their conclusions on results from a search carried out for trials in 2012 which found no relevant randomised studies. Current monitoring is mainly based on the agreement of experts, medical experience and good intentions. This does not mean that physical health monitoring is invalid, wrong or not of benefit to the physical health of people with severe mental illness, only that there is as yet no definite proof. Physical health care monitoring has the potential and promise to improve quality of life and help people with mental health problems live longer, but at this stage the information is uncertain and the research evidence unclear.

AB: Abstract - Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review ‐ one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD ‐ focuses on second‐generation antidepressants (SGAs). Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non‐randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random‐effects (Mantel‐Haenszel) meta‐analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi 2  statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I 2  statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots.We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. Main results We identified 3745 citations after de‐duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate‐quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low‐quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors' conclusions Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high‐risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. Plain language summary Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? • Anyone who has experienced winter depression. • Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. • General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists. • Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended‐release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.

The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018.

Selection criteria To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non‐randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second‐generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model, but included only one study. Main results We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH‐SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin. Authors' conclusions Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.

General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. What questions does this review aim to answer? Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. What does evidence from the review reveal? The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples' preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.

AB: Abstract - Background Anxiety and depression affect many people. Treatments do not have complete success and often require people to take drugs for long periods of time. Many people look for other treatments that may help. One of those is Reiki, a 2500 year old treatment described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy, and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. There have been reports of Reiki alleviating anxiety and depression, but no specific systematic review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of Reiki for treating anxiety and depression in people aged 16 and over. Search methods Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL ‐ all years), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR ‐ all years), EMBASE, (1974 to November 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2014) and AMED (1985 to November 2014). Additional searches were carried out on the World Health Organization Trials Portal (ICTRP) together with ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. All searches were up to date as of 4 November 2014. Selection criteria Randomised trials in adults with anxiety or depression or both, with at least one arm treated with Reiki delivered by a trained Reiki practitioner. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently decided on inclusion/exclusion of studies and extracted data. A prior analysis plan had been specified but was not needed as the data were too sparse. Main results We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy‐proven diagnosis of non‐metastatic prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external‐beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community‐living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students. These studies included subgroups with anxiety and depression as defined by symptom scores and provided data separately for those subgroups. As this included only 25 people with anxiety and 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression, but which was not specified, the results could only be reported narratively. They show no evidence that Reiki is either beneficial or harmful in this population. The risk of bias for the included studies was generally rated as unclear or high for most domains, which reduces the certainty of the evidence. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to say whether or not Reiki is useful for people over 16 years of age with anxiety or depression or both. Plain language summary Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression Review Question This review summarises the evidence from randomised controlled trials that test whether Reiki if beneficial for people with anxiety or depression. Background Reiki is a non‐drug treatment that is used on people with anxiety, depression or both. Reiki is a 2500 year old treatment, described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. But there is no systematic review of randomised trials evaluating whether it works in this group of people. Study characteristics We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy‐proven diagnosis of prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external‐beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community‐living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students.These studies included people with anxiety or depression or both, and reported their results separately. This included only 25 people with anxiety, 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression but which was not specified. The search is up to date as of 4 November 2014. Key results Very few people with anxiety or depression or both have been included in randomised studies. This means there is insufficient evidence to make any comment about the usefulness of Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Quality of the evidence At best, the quality of the evidence is moderate which, on top of a dearth of evidence, weakens the findings further.

AB: Abstract - Background Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic demonstrated to be superior in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia which causes fewer movement disorders. Clozapine, however, entails a significant risk of serious blood disorders such as agranulocytosis which could be potentially fatal. Currently there are a number of newer antipsychotics which have been developed with the purpose to find both a better tolerability profile and a superior effectiveness. Objectives To compare the clinical effects of clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics (such as amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone and zotepine) in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (June 2007) and reference lists of all included randomised controlled trials. We also manually searched appropriate journals and conference proceedings relating to clozapine combination strategies and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria All relevant randomised, at least single‐blind trials, comparing clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics, any dose and oral formulations, for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Data collection and analysis We selected trials and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a random‐effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 27 blinded randomised controlled trials, which involved 3099 participants. Twelve randomised control trials compared clozapine with olanzapine, five with quetiapine, nine with risperidone, one with ziprasidone and two with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (overall 30.1%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Clozapine had a higher attrition rate due to adverse effects than olanzapine (9 RCTs, n=1674, RR 1.60 CI 1.07 to 2.40, NNT 25 CI 15 to 73) and risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 1.88 CI 1.11 to 3.21, NNT 16 CI 9 to 59). Fewer participants in the clozapine groups left the trials early due to inefficacy than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 0.40 CI 0.23 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 7 to 21), suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine. Clozapine was more efficacious than zotepine in improving the participants general mental state (BPRS total score: 1 RCT, n=59, MD ‐6.00 CI ‐9.83 to ‐2.17), but not consistently more than olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. There was no significant difference between clozapine and olanzapine or risperidone in terms of positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. According to two studies from China quetiapine was more efficacious for negative symptoms than clozapine (2 RCTs, n=142, MD 2.23 CI 0.99 to 3.48). Clozapine produced somewhat fewer extrapyramidal side‐effects than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication: 6 RCTs, n=304, RR 0.39 CI 0.22 to 0.68, NNT 7 CI 5 to 18) and zotepine (n=59, RR 0.05 CI 0.00 to 0.86, NNT 3 CI 2 to 5). More participants in the clozapine group showed decreased white blood cells than those taking olanzapine, more hypersalivation and sedation than those on olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine and more seizures than people on olanzapine and risperidone. Also clozapine produced an important weight gain not seen with risperidone. Other differences in adverse effects were less documented and should be replicated, for example, clozapine did not alter prolactin levels whereas olanzapine, risperidone and zotepine did; compared with quetiapine, clozapine produced a higher incidence of electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations; and compared with quetiapine and risperidone clozapine produced a higher increase of triglyceride levels. Other findings that should be replicated were: clozapine improved social functioning less than risperidone and fewer participants in the clozapine group had to be hospitalised to avoid suicide attempts compared to olanzapine. Other important outcomes such as service use, cognitive functioning, satisfaction with care or quality of life were rarely reported. Authors' conclusions Clozapine may be a little more efficacious than zotepine and risperidone but further trials are required to confirm this finding. Clozapine differs more clearly in adverse effects from other second generation antipsychotics and the side‐effect profile could be key in the selection of treatment depending on the clinical situation and a patient’s preferences. Data on other important outcomes such as cognitive functioning, quality of life, death or service use are currently largely missing, making further large and well‐designed trials necessary. It is also important to take into account that the large number of people leaving the studies early limits the validity and interpretation of our findings. Plain language summary Clozapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review compared the clinical effects of clozapine with the other atypical antipsychotics. Twenty‐seven studies fulfilled the review's criteria and provided data to compare clozapine with antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and zotepine. Clozapine was somewhat more efficacious than zotepine. Also, inefficacy of treatment led more frequently to leaving the studies early in the risperidone group suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine. The principal drawback of clozapine were its adverse effects which lead to significantly higher numbers of participants leaving the studies early compared to olanzapine and risperidone. Clozapine was associated with more sedation and hypersalivation than olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone and with more seizures than olanzapine and risperidone. There was a higher incidence of white blood cell decrease in clozapine groups than olanzapine and more weight gain than in risperidone groups. On the other hand clozapine produced fewer movement disorder than risperidone and less prolactin increase than olanzapine, quetiapine and zotepine.

AB: Abstract - Background Rates of major depression among people living with HIV (PLWH) are substantially higher than those seen in the general population and this may adversely affect antiretroviral treatment outcomes. Several unique clinical and psychosocial factors may contribute to the development and persistence of depression in PLWH. Given these influences, it is unclear if antidepressant therapy is as effective for PLWH as the general population. Objectives To assess the efficacy of antidepressant therapy for treatment of depression in PLWH. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's specialised register (CCMD‐CTR), the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and ran a cited reference search on the Web of Science for reports of all included studies. We conducted additional searches of the international trial registers including; ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization Trials Portal (ICTRP), and the HIV and AIDS ‐ Clinical trials register. We searched grey literature and reference lists to identify additional studies and contacted authors to obtain missing data. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches, which included studies conducted between 1 January 1980 and 18 April 2017. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials of antidepressant drug therapy compared to placebo or another antidepressant drug class. Participants eligible for inclusion had to be aged 18 years and older, from any setting, and have both HIV and depression. Depression was defined according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases criteria. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We presented categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Continuous outcomes were presented mean (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with standard deviations (SD). We assessed quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 10 studies with 709 participants in this review. Of the 10 studies, eight were conducted in high income countries (USA and Italy), seven were conducted prior to 2000 and seven had predominantly men. Seven studies assessed antidepressants versus placebo, two compared different antidepressant classes and one had three arms comparing two antidepressant classes with placebo. Antidepressant therapy may result in a greater improvement in depression compared to placebo. There was a moderate improvement in depression when assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D) score as a continuous outcome (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.96; participants = 357; studies = 6; I 2  = 62%, low quality evidence). However, there was no evidence of improvement when this was assessed with HAM‐D score as a dichotomized outcome (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.35; participants = 434; studies = 5; I 2  = 0%, low quality evidence) or Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI‐I) score (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.77; participants = 346; studies = 4; I 2  = 29%, low quality evidence). There was little to no difference in the proportion of study dropouts between study arms (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.80; participants = 306; studies = 4; I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence). The methods of reporting adverse events varied substantially between studies, this resulted in very low quality evidence contributing to a pooled estimate (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21; participants = 167; studies = 2; I 2  = 34%; very low quality evidence). Based on this, we were unable to determine if there was a difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in the antidepressant versus placebo arms. However, sexual dysfunction was reported commonly in people receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). People receiving tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) frequently reported anticholinergic adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation. There were no reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in any study group. There was no evidence of a difference in follow‐up CD4 count at study termination (MD ‐6.31 cells/mm 3 , 95% CI ‐72.76 to 60.14; participants = 176; studies = 3; I 2  = 0%; low quality evidence). Only one study evaluated quality of life score (MD 3.60, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 7.58; participants = 87; studies = 1; very low quality evidence), due to the poor quality evidence we could not draw conclusions for this outcome. There were few studies comparing different antidepressant classes. We are uncertain if SSRIs differ from TCAs with regard to improvement in depression as evaluated by HAM‐D score (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐10.87 to 4.47; participants = 14; studies = 1; very low quality evidence). There was some evidence that mirtazapine resulted in a greater improvement in depression compared to an SSRI (MD 9.00, 95% CI 3.61 to 14.39; participants = 70; studies = 1; low quality evidence); however, this finding was not consistent for all measures of improvement in depression for this comparison. No studies reported on virological suppression or any other HIV specific outcomes. The studies included in this review had an overall unclear or high risk of bias due to under‐reporting of study methods, high risk of attrition bias and inadequate sequence generation methods. Heterogeneity between studies and the limited number of participants, and events lead to downgrading of the quality of the evidence for several outcomes. Authors' conclusions This review demonstrates that antidepressant therapy may be more beneficial than placebo for the treatment of depression in PLWH. The low quality of the evidence contributing to this assessment and the lack of studies representing PLWH from generalized epidemics in low‐ to middle‐income countries make the relevance of these finding in today's context limited. Future studies that evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy should be designed and conducted rigorously. Such studies should incorporate evaluation of stepped care models and health system strengthening interventions in the study design. In addition, outcomes related to HIV care and antiretroviral therapy should be reported. Plain language summary Antidepressant drugs for treatment of depression in people living with HIV Why is this review important? Depression is very common among people living with HIV. There are many unique issues which influence the development and possibly the recovery from depression in this group. We are therefore uncertain whether the antidepressant drugs which are usually used to treat depression in people without HIV will be as effective in PLWH. Who will be interested in this review? PLWH, general practitioners, HIV clinicians and professionals working in mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? ‐ Are antidepressant medicines more effective than using a placebo (pretend treatment) for treatment of depression in PLWH? ‐ Do more people stop attending services (dropout) if they are receiving antidepressant medicines compared to placebos? ‐ Are there any serious side effects to antidepressant medicines which specifically affect PLWH? ‐ Which type of antidepressant medicine is most effective for depressed PLWH? ‐ Does treating depression with antidepressants in PLWH improve antiretroviral treatment outcomes among people also receiving HIV treatment? Which studies were included in the review? We searched several databases to find randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) which compared antidepressant therapy to placebo or other antidepressant drugs for treatment of depression in PLWH. Studies had to have been conducted between 1 January 1980 and 18 April 2017 to be included in the review. Ten studies with 709 participants were included. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Most studies were conducted more than a decade ago, in the USA, in predominantly men. We found that antidepressant therapy may improve depressive symptoms when compared to a placebo tablet. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of people who dropped out of care when comparing people who received antidepressants with people who received a placebo. We cannot be certain if one type of antidepressant works better than another. Side effects were very common among all study participants. Although there were no clear conclusions on which side effects were most common or if side effects occurred more frequently in people taking antidepressants compared to a placebo, participants receiving antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors did report sexual problems frequently. People receiving medicines called tricyclic antidepressants reported constipation and dry mouth frequently. No studies reported on how antidepressant therapy affected the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. The evidence used to generate several of the results was assessed as low or very low quality. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that new studies on treatment of depression should be conducted in countries and population groups where HIV is most common. These studies should evaluate what causes depression in these populations and how to best to incorporate antidepressant therapy with other strategies for the management of PLWH and depression.

AB: Abstract - Background Acupuncture, with many categories such as traditional acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, and acupoint injection, has been shown to be relatively safe with few adverse effects. It is accessible and inexpensive, at least in China, and is likely to be widely used there for psychotic symptoms. Objectives To review the effects of acupuncture, alone or in combination treatments compared with placebo (or no treatment) or any other treatments for people with schizophrenia or related psychoses. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (February 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and clinical trials registries. We also inspected references of identified studies and contacted relevant authors for additional information. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials involving people with schizophrenia‐like illnesses, comparing acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics with standard dose antipsychotics alone, acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics with standard dose antipsychotics, acupuncture with antipsychotics, acupuncture added to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) drug with TCM drug, acupuncture with TCM drug, electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy. Data collection and analysis We reliably extracted data from all included studies, discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and contacted authors of studies when necessary. We analysed binary outcomes using a standard estimation of risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences with 95% CI. For homogeneous data we used fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results After an update search in 2012 the review now includes 30 studies testing different forms of acupuncture across six different comparisons. All studies were at moderate risk of bias. When acupuncture plus standard antipsychotic treatment was compared with standard antipsychotic treatment alone, people were at less risk of being 'not improved' (n = 244, 3 RCTs, medium‐term RR 0.40 CI 0.28 to 0.57,  very low quality evidence ). Mental state findings were mostly consistent with this finding as was time in hospital (n = 120, 1 RCT, days MD ‐16.00 CI ‐19.54 to ‐12.46,  moderate quality evidence ). If anything, adverse effects were less for the acupuncture group (e.g. central nervous system, insomnia, short‐term, n = 202, 3 RCTs, RR 0.30 CI 0.11 to 0.83,  low quality evidence ). When acupuncture was added to low dose antipsychotics and this was compared with standard dose antipsychotic drugs, relapse was less in the experimental group (n = 170, 1 RCT, long‐term RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.89,  very low quality evidence ) but there was no difference for the outcome of 'not improved'. Again, mental state findings were mostly consistent with the latter. Incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms ‐ akathisia, were less for those in the acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics group (n = 180, 1 RCT, short‐term RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.49,  low quality evidence ) ‐ as dry mouth, blurred vision and tachycardia. When acupuncture was compared with antipsychotic drugs of known efficacy in standard doses, there were equivocal data for outcomes such as 'not improved' using different global state criteria. Traditional acupuncture added to TCM drug had benefit over use of TCM drug alone (n = 360, 2 RCTs, RR no clinically important change 0.11 CI 0.02 to 0.59,  low quality evidence ), but when traditional acupuncture was compared with TCM drug directly there was no significant difference in the short‐term. However, we found that participants given electroacupuncture were significantly less likely to experience a worsening in global state (n = 88, 1 RCT, short‐term RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80,  low quality evidence ). In the one study that compared electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy there were significantly different rates of spinal fracture between the groups (n = 68, 1 RCT, short‐term RR 0.33 CI 0.14 to 0.81,  low quality evidence ). Attrition in all studies was minimal. No studies reported death, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, or economic outcomes. Authors' conclusions Limited evidence suggests that acupuncture may have some antipsychotic effects as measured on global and mental state with few adverse effects. Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of acupuncture for people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Acupuncture for schizophrenia Although acupuncture or Traditional Chinese Medicine has been practised for over 2000 years in China and the Far East, especially in Korea and Japan, it is a relatively new form of treament for physical and psychological conditions in the West. Acupuncture inserts needles into the skin to stimulate specific points of the body (acupoints). The aim is to achieve balance and harmony of the body. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness and is usually treated using antipsychotic medication. However, although effective, antipsychotic medication can cause side‐effects (such as sleepiness, weight gain and even dribbling). Acupuncture has been shown to have very few negative effects on the individual and could be more socially acceptable and tolerable for people with mental health problems. Acupuncture may also be less expensive than drugs made by pharmaceutical companies, so reducing costs to individuals and health services. This reviews looks at the effectiveness of various types of acupuncture as treatment for people with schizophrenia. An update search for studies was carried out in 2012 and found 30 studies that randomised participants who were receiving antipsychotic medication to receive additional acupuncture or standard care. Although some of the studies did favour acupuncture when combined with antipsychotics, the information available was small scale and rated to be very low or low quality by the review authors, so not completely provable and valid. Depression was reduced when combining acupuncture with antipsychotic medication, but again this finding came from small‐scale research, so cannot be clearly shown to be true. The review concludes that people with mental health problems, policy makers and health professionals need much better evidence in order to establish if there are any potential benefits to acupuncture. This means that the question of whether acupuncture is of benefit to people, and whether it is of greater benefit than antipsychotic medication, remains unanswered. There is not enough information to establish that acupuncture is of benefit or harm to people with mental health problems.

AB: Abstract - Background Oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (Clopixol) is an anti‐psychotic treatment for people with psychotic symptoms, especially those with schizophrenia. It is associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a prolongation of the QTc interval, extra‐pyramidal reactions, venous thromboembolism and may modify insulin and glucose responses. Objectives To determine the effects of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for treatment of schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (latest search 09 June 2015). There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for schizophrenia. We included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included 20 trials, randomising 1850 participants. Data were reported for 12 comparisons, predominantly for the short term (up to 12 weeks) and inpatient populations. Overall risk of bias for included studies was low to unclear. Data were unavailable for many of our pre‐stated outcomes of interest. No data were available, across all comparisons, for death, duration of stay in hospital and general functioning. Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride versus: 1. placebo Movement disorders (EPSEs) were similar between groups (1 RCT, n = 28, RR 6.07 95% CI 0.86 to 43.04 very low‐quality evidence). There was no clear difference in numbers leaving the study early (2 RCTs, n = 100, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.60, very low‐quality evidence). 2. chlorpromazine No clear differences were found for the outcomes of global state (average CGI‐SI endpoint score) (1 RCT, n = 60, MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.49 to 0.49) or movement disorders (EPSEs) (3 RCTs, n = 199, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.45), both very low‐quality evidence. More people left the study early for any reason from the zuclopenthixol group (6 RCTs, n = 766, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81, low‐quality evidence). 3. chlorprothixene There was no clear difference in numbers leaving the study early for any reason (1 RCT, n = 20, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93, very low‐quality evidence). 4. clozapine No useable data were presented. 5. haloperidol No clear differences between treatment groups were found for the outcomes global state score (average CGI endpoint score) (1 RCT, n = 49, MD 0.13, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 0.55) or leaving the study early (2 RCTs, n = 141, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.35), both very low‐quality evidence. 6. perphenazine Those receiving zuclopenthixol were more likely to require medication in the short term for EPSEs than perphenazine (1 RCT, n = 50, RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.22, very low‐quality evidence). Similar numbers left the study early (2 RCTs, n = 104, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.47, very low‐quality evidence). 7. risperidone Those receiving zuclopenthixol were more likely to require medications for EPSEs than risperidone (1 RCT, n = 98,RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.28, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in numbers leaving the study early ( 3 RCTs, n = 154, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.02) or in mental state (average PANSS total endpoint score) (1 RCT, n = 25, MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐7.71 to 1.31), both very low‐quality evidence). 8. sulpiride No clear differences were found for global state (average CGI endpoint score) ( 1 RCT, n = 61, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.85, very low‐quality evidence), requiring hypnotics/sedatives (1 RCT, n = 61, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.32, very low‐quality evidence) or leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 61, RR 2.07 95% CI 0.97 to 4.40, very low‐quality evidence). 9. thiothixene No clear differences were found for the outcomes of 'global state (average CGI endpoint score) (1 RCT, n = 20, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.46) or leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 20, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.35), both very low‐quality evidence). 10. trifluoperazine No useable data were presented. 11. zuclopenthixol depot There was no clear difference in numbers leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 46, RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.58, very low‐quality evidence). 12. Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (cis z isomer) versus zuclopenthixol (cis z/trans e isomer) There were no clear differences in reported side‐effects ( 1 RCT, n = 57, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.18, very low‐quality evidence) and in numbers leaving the study early (4 RCTs, n = 140, RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.49 to 9.41, very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride appears to cause more EPSEs than clozapine, risperidone or perphenazine, but there was no difference in EPSEs when compared to placebo or chlorpromazine. Similar numbers required hypnotics/sedatives when zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride was compared to sulpiride, and similar numbers of reported side‐effects were found when its isomers were compared. The other comparisons did not report adverse‐effect data. Reported data indicate zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride demonstrates no difference in mental or global states compared to placebo, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, clozapine, haloperidol, perphenazine, sulpiride, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, depot and isomers. Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, when compared with risperidone, is favoured when assessed using the PANSS in the short term, but not in the medium term. The data extracted from the included studies are mostly equivocal, and very low to low quality, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Prescribing practice is unlikely to change based on this meta‐analysis. Recommending any particular course of action about side‐effect medication other than monitoring, using rating scales and clinical assessment, and prescriptions on a case‐by‐case basis, is also not possible. There is a need for further studies covering this topic with more antipsychotic comparisons for currently relevant outcomes. Plain language summary Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for schizophrenia Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where people experience delusions (strange thoughts/ideas) and/or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not real). These are often known as positive or acute symptoms. People also experience negative or chronic symptoms which usually follow acute symptoms. These can include withdrawing from social contact, lack of interest in everyday activities, depression as well as problems with memory and thought processing. Treatment usually involves a package of care involving medications known as antipsychotics, and if necessary, additional therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Psychoeducation or Occupational therapy. There are many different antipsychotics available; knowing how effective each one is compared with no treatment or placebo (dummy treatment) and with other antipsychotics is important. This review compares the oral form of the antipsychotic zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride with other antipsychotics and placebo. Searching for evidence An electronic search was run on 9 June 2015, searching for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia into treatment groups that received either zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride or placebo or another antipsychotic. Evidence found The review authors found 20 trials with 1850 participants. Most of these participants were patients in psychiatric hospitals. The trials compared oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride to placebo and nine other oral antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, clozapine, haloperidol, perphenazine, risperidone, sulpiride, thiothixene, and trifluoperazine). There were also trials that compared oral zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride with an injection of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride and some that compared two different versions of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. The review authors were interested in finding evidence for zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride's effect on seven main outcomes: global state, mental state, adverse effects, death, duration of stay in hospital, leaving the study early and general functioning. Unfortunately many data provided by the trials were unusable, data were available only for global state, mental state, leaving the study early and the adverse effect of movement disorders. The trials comparing zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride with sulpiride and trifluoperazine did not provide any useable data for any of these main outcomes. Overall results suggest zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride's effect on global and mental state, and number of participants leaving the study early is similar to the other anti‐psychotics listed above. Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride may cause more movement disorders than clozapine, risperidone or perphenazine, but there was no difference for the other drug comparisons or placebo. Conclusions The evidence currently available is of very low to low quality and the meaning is therefore unclear. Data for many important outcomes are not available making conclusions about overall effectiveness of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride difficult. Evidence available suggest that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride is not any worse than other antipsychotics in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, however more trials providing good‐quality data are needed before firm conclusions can be made.

AB: Abstract - Background Perazine is an old phenothiazine derivative used for the treatment of people with schizophrenia and is reputed to have a low level of extrapyramidal adverse effects. As far as we are aware, its use is limited to Germany, Poland, the former Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. Objectives To examine the effects of perazine for those with schizophrenia or related psychoses in comparison with placebo, no treatment or other antipsychotic medications. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases Biological Abstracts, CINAHL,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, LILACS, PSYNDEX, Sociological Abstracts and Sociofile. We searched the references of all included studies for further trials. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials. We updated this search on 16th July 2012. Selection criteria We selected all randomised controlled trials that compared perazine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses, or both. Data collection and analysis The review authors (SL, BH, BHe) independently inspected the citations and where possible abstracts and ordered papers for re‐inspection and quality assessment. We independently extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We inspected all data for heterogeneity, assessed trials for risk of bias and created summary of findings tables using GRADE. Main results The review now includes seven trials with a total of 479 participants. In only one trial, with 95 participants, perazine appeared superior to 'active placebo' (trimipramine) at five weeks for the outcome of 'no important global improvement' (n = 95, RR 0.43 CI 0.2 to 0.8,  low quality evidence ), but there was no statistically significant difference in most measures of mental state. Perazine did not induce more general adverse events than placebo but more participants received at least one dose of antiparkinson medication (n = 95, RR 4.50 CI 1.0 to 19.5,  very low quality evidence ). Six small trials comparing perazine with other antipsychotics, including 384 participants in total, were incompletely reported and the outcomes were presented in various ways so that meta‐analysis was not possible on most occasions. In the six studies, a similar number of participants receiving perazine or comparator antipsychotics (amisulpride, haloperidol, olanzapine, ziprasidone, zotepine) left the studies early (n = 384, RR 0.97 CI 0.68 to 1.38,  low quality evidence ). The results on efficacy could not be meta‐analysed because the authors presented their results in very different ways. No obvious differences in adverse events between perazine and other antipsychotics could be derived from the limited data. Two haloperidol comparisons did not present extrapyramidal side‐effects in a way that was suitable for use in meta‐analysis, but three small comparisons with the second‐generation antipsychotics zotepine and amisulpride showed no higher risk of akathisia (n = 111, RR 0.31 CI 0.1 to 1.1), dyskinesia (n = 111, RR 0.47 CI 0.1 to 3.5), parkinsonism (n = 81, RR 1.21 CI 0.5 2.8) or tremor (n = 40, RR 0.80 CI 0.3 to 2.6) with perazine. Authors' conclusions The number, size and reporting of randomised controlled perazine trials are insufficient to present firm conclusions about the properties of this antipsychotic. It is possible that perazine is associated with a similar risk of extrapyramidal side‐effects as some atypical antipsychotics but this is based on small comparisons. This should be clarified in larger, well‐designed trials. Plain language summary Perazine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is often a severe and disabling illness that affects approximately one per cent of the worldwide population. Schizophrenia has 'positive' symptoms, such as strange and fixed beliefs (delusions), as well as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations). Schizophrenia also has 'negative' symptoms such as apathy, loss of emotion, lack of drive and disorganisation of behaviour and thought. The degree of disability is considerable with 80% ‐ 90% not working and up to 10% dying. Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, and are grouped into older drugs (first generation or ‘typical’) and newer drugs (second generation or ‘atypical’). However, antipsychotic drugs also have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders such as uncontrollable shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness, tiredness, weight gain and the inability to sit still. Perazine is an older antipsychotic drug first introduced in the 1950s. It is suggested to have a low level of side effects (especially for movement disorders). Its use is regional and restricted to countries like Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. A search for trials was carried out in July 2012. The review now includes seven studies with a total of 479 participants and assesses the effects of perazine for people with schizophrenia. Comparisons of perazine versus placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) and versus other antipsychotic drugs revealed no clear differences or superiority of perazine. However, only a handful of studies have been undertaken and the number of participants in each study was small. In addition the studies avialable were of limited quality with data for the main outcomes of interest rated as low or very low quality. As perazine is a cheap drug and there is some limited evidence that it may cause less side effects than other older antipsychotic drugs, further large scale, well designed and well‐reported studies are much needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega‐3 PUFAs) from fish and plant sources are commonly considered as a promising non‐medical alternative to improve brain functions and slow down the progression of dementia. This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega‐3 PUFAs play in the development and integrity of the brain's neurons, their protective antioxidative effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical mechanisms directly related to Alzheimer‐specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega‐3 PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega‐3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option for dementia. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with dementia. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We contacted manufacturers of omega‐3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega‐3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were administered to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Data collection and analysis The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, dementia severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted meta‐analyses for available outcome measures at six months. Main results We included three comparable randomised, placebo‐controlled trials investigating omega‐3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants with mild to moderate AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of dementia. All trials were of high methodological quality. The overall quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was high. There was no evidence of a benefit from omega‐3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini‐Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating ‐ Sum of Boxes (MD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease scale (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega‐3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD ‐3.50, 95% CI ‐4.30 to ‐2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency between omega‐3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment. Authors' conclusions We found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega‐3 PUFA supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. This result was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with dementia. Adverse effects of omega‐3 PUFAs seemed to be low, but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability. The effects on other populations remain unclear. Plain language summary Omega‐3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia Background Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega‐3 PUFAs) are assumed to have a beneficial effect on the function of the brain. It has been suggested that they might improve or delay decline in memory and ability to carry out everyday tasks in people with dementia. In this review, we investigated randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing omega‐3 PUFAs, given in the form of supplements or enriched diets, with placebo (a pretend treatment) in people with the most common types of dementia. Included trials We included three trials that investigated 632 people with Alzheimer's disease of mild to moderate severity. We found no trials on other types of dementia. In all trials participants took either placebo or omega‐3 PUFA supplements. The quality of the trials was good. The participants were allocated to the groups randomly. The participants and most of the investigators did not know which treatment was given. Results When we combined the results of the trials, we found that taking omega‐3 PUFA supplements for six months had no effect on cognition (learning and understanding), everyday functioning, quality of life or mental health. One very small study observed that omega‐3 PUFAs improved cognitively complex daily activities, such as shopping, when taken for a longer period of time. However, the quality of the evidence was only moderate, so this should be confirmed in further trials. Omega‐3 PUFAs also had no effect on ratings of the overall severity of the illness. The trials did not report side effects very well, but none of the studies reported significant harmful effects on health. Conclusion Altogether, the quality of the evidence was moderate or high for most of the effects that we measured, but we found no evidence for either benefit or harm from omega‐3 PUFA supplements in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The effects on people with other types of dementia remain unclear.

AB: Abstract - Background Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) are common and disabling disorders. Many patients experience difficulties accessing specialist psychological treatments. Pure self‐help (PSH: self‐help material only) or guided self‐help (GSH: self‐help material with therapist guidance), may bridge this gap. Objectives Main objective:   Evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) / controlled clinical trials (CCTs) for the efficacy of PSH/GSH with respect to eating disorder symptoms, compared with waiting list or placebo/attention control, other psychological or pharmacological treatments (or combinations/augmentations) in people with eating disorders. Secondary objective:   Evaluate evidence for the efficacy of PSH/GSH regarding comorbid symptomatology and costs. Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched in November 2005, other electronic databases were searched, relevant journals and grey literature were checked, and personal approaches were made to authors. Selection criteria Published/unpublished RCTs/CCTs evaluating PSH/GSH for any eating disorder. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted using a customized spreadsheet. Relative Risks (RR) were calculated from dichotomous data and weighted/standardized mean differences (WMD/SMD) from continuous data, using a random effects model. Main results Twelve RCTs and three CCTs were identified, all focusing on BN, BED, EDNOS or combinations of these, in adults, using manual‐based PSH/GSH across various settings. Primary comparisons:   At end of treatment, PSH/GSH did not significantly differ from waiting list in abstinence from bingeing (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09), or purging (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08), although these treatments produced greater improvement on other eating disorder symptoms, psychiatric symptomatology and interpersonal functioning but not depression. Compared to other formal psychological therapies, PSH/GSH did not differ significantly at end of treatment or follow‐up in improvement on bingeing and purging (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31), other eating disorder symptoms, level of interpersonal functioning or depression. There were no significant differences in treatment dropout. Secondary comparisons:   One small study in BED found that cognitive‐behavioural GSH compared to a non‐specific control treatment produced significantly greater improvements in abstinence from bingeing and other eating disorder symptoms. Studies comparing PSH with GSH found no significant differences between treatment groups at end of treatment or follow‐up. Comparison between different types of PSH/GSH found significant differences on eating disorder symptoms but not on bingeing/purging abstinence rates. Authors' conclusions PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment and may have potential as an alternative to formal therapist‐delivered psychological therapy. Future research should focus on producing large well‐conducted studies of self‐help treatments in eating disorders including health economic evaluations, different types and modes of delivering self‐help (e.g. computerised versus manual‐based) and different populations and settings. Plain language summary Self‐help and guided self‐help for eating disorders The eating disorders (anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)) are disabling conditions and specialist treatment is not always easily accessible. Self‐help may bridge the gap. This review aimed to evaluate pure self‐help (PSH) and guided self‐help (GSH) interventions for eating disorders for all ages and genders, compared to psychological, pharmacological or control treatments and waiting list. Fifteen trials were identified, all focused on BN, BED or EDNOS, using manual‐based self‐help. There is some evidence that PSH/GSH reduce eating disorder and other symptoms in comparison to waiting list or control treatment and may produce comparable outcomes to formal therapist‐delivered psychological therapies. PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment. In the future there need to be large well‐conducted effectiveness studies of self‐help treatments with or without guidance incorporating cost evaluations and investigation of different types of self‐help in different populations and settings.

AB: Abstract - Background Efficacy of light therapy for non‐seasonal depression has been studied without any consensus on its efficacy. Objectives To evaluate clinical effects of light therapy in comparison to the inactive placebo treatment for non‐seasonal depression. Search methods We searched the Depression Anxiety & Neurosis Controlled Trials register (CCDANCTR January 2003), comprising the results of searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 ‐), EMBASE (1980 ‐), CINAHL (1982 ‐), LILACS (1982 ‐), National Research Register, PsycINFO/PsycLIT (1974 ‐), PSYNDEX (1977 ‐), and SIGLE (1982 ‐ ) using the group search strategy and the following terms: #30 = phototherapy or ("light therapy" or light‐therapy). We also sought trials from conference proceedings and references of included papers, and contacted the first author of each study as well as leading researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing bright light with inactive placebo treatments for non‐seasonal depression. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted and quality assessment was made independently by two reviewers. The authors were contacted to obtain additional information. Main results Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. In general, the quality of reporting was poor, and many reviews did not report adverse effects systematically. The treatment response in the bright light group was better than in the control treatment group, but did not reach statistical significance. The result was mainly based on studies of less than 8 days of treatment. The response to bright light was significantly better than to control treatment in high‐quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.50 to ‐0.31), in studies applying morning light treatment (SMD ‐0.38, CI ‐0.62 to ‐0.14), and in sleep deprivation responders (SMD ‐1.02, CI ‐1.60 to ‐0.45). Hypomania was more common in the bright light group compared to the control treatment group (risk ratio 4.91, CI 1.66 to 14.46, number needed to harm 8, CI 5 to 20). Authors' conclusions For patients suffering from non‐seasonal depression, light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy, especially when administered during the first week of treatment, in the morning, and as an adjunctive treatment to sleep deprivation responders. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution. Plain language summary Light treatment for non‐seasonal depression The reviewers conclude that the benefit of light treatment is modest though promising for non‐seasonal depression. The short‐term treatment as well as light administered in the morning and with concomitant sleep deprivation in sleep deprivation responders appear to be most beneficial for treatment response. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.

AB: Abstract - Background Inpatient treatment is an expensive way of caring for people with acute psychiatric disorders. It has been proposed that many of those currently treated as inpatients could be cared for in acute psychiatric day hospitals. Objectives To assess the effects of day hospital versus inpatient care for people with acute psychiatric disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We approached trialists to identify unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of day hospital versus inpatient care, for people with acute psychiatric disorders. Studies were ineligible if a majority of participants were under 18 or over 65, or had a primary diagnosis of substance abuse or organic brain disorder. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted and cross‐checked data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Day hospital trials tend to present similar outcomes in slightly different formats, making it difficult to synthesise data. We therefore sought individual patient data so that we could re‐analyse outcomes in a common format. Main results Ten trials (involving 2685 people) met the inclusion criteria. We obtained individual patient data for four trials (involving 646 people). We found no difference in the number lost to follow‐up by one year between day hospital care and inpatient care (5 RCTs, n = 1694, RR 0.94 CI 0.82 to 1.08). There is moderate evidence that the duration of index admission is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (4 RCTs, n = 1582, WMD 27.47 CI 3.96 to 50.98). There is very low evidence that the duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month) is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (3 RCTs, n = 265, WMD 2.34 days/month CI 1.97 to 2.70). There is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for the being readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge (5 RCTs, n = 667, RR 0.91 CI 0.72 to 1.15). It is likely that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for being unemployed at the end of the study (1 RCT, n = 179, RR 0.88 CI 0.66 to 1.19), for quality of life (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.01 CI ‐0.13 to 0.15) or for treatment satisfaction (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.06 CI ‐0.18 to 0.30). Authors' conclusions Caring for people in acute day hospitals is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients. However, further data are still needed on the cost effectiveness of day hospitals. Plain language summary Day hospital versus admission for acute psychiatric disorders Day hospitals are a less restrictive alternative to inpatient admission for people who are acutely and severely mentally ill. This review compares acute day hospital care to inpatient care. We found that at least one in five patients currently admitted to inpatient care could feasibly be cared for in an acute day hospital. Patients treated in the day hospital had the same levels of treatment satisfaction and quality of life as those cared for as inpatients. The day hospital patients were also no more likely to be unemployed at the end of their care.

AB: Abstract - Background Common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are estimated to affect up to 15% of the UK population at any one time, and health care systems worldwide need to implement interventions to reduce the impact and burden of these conditions. Collaborative care is a complex intervention based on chronic disease management models that may be effective in the management of these common mental health problems. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with depression or anxiety. Search methods We searched the following databases to February 2012: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials registers (CCDANCTR‐References and CCDANCTR‐Studies) which include relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years); the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP); ClinicalTrials.gov; and CINAHL (to November 2010 only). We screened the reference lists of reports of all included studies and published systematic reviews for reports of additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of collaborative care for participants of all ages with depression or anxiety. Data collection and analysis Two independent researchers extracted data using a standardised data extraction sheet. Two independent researchers made 'Risk of bias' assessments using criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration. We combined continuous measures of outcome using standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We combined dichotomous measures using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results. Main results We included seventy‐nine RCTs (including 90 relevant comparisons) involving 24,308 participants in the review. Studies varied in terms of risk of bias. The results of primary analyses demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression outcomes for adults with depression treated with the collaborative care model in the short‐term (SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.27; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.43), medium‐term (SMD ‐0.28, 95% CI ‐0.41 to ‐0.15; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48), and long‐term (SMD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.24; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.41). However, these significant benefits were not demonstrated into the very long‐term (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27). The results also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in anxiety outcomes for adults with anxiety treated with the collaborative care model in the short‐term (SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.44 to ‐0.17; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87), medium‐term (SMD ‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.47 to ‐0.19; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69), and long‐term (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.34 to ‐0.06; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42). No comparisons examined the effects of the intervention on anxiety outcomes in the very long‐term. There was evidence of benefit in secondary outcomes including medication use, mental health quality of life, and patient satisfaction, although there was less evidence of benefit in physical quality of life. Authors' conclusions Collaborative care is associated with significant improvement in depression and anxiety outcomes compared with usual care, and represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression and anxiety. Plain language summary Collaborative care for people with depression and anxiety Many people suffer from depression and anxiety. These problems can make people feel sad, scared and even suicidal, and can affect their work, their relationships and their quality of life. Depression and anxiety can occur because of personal, financial, social or health problems. ‘Collaborative care’ is an innovative way of treating depression and anxiety. It involves a number of health professionals working with a patient to help them overcome their problems. Collaborative care often involves a medical doctor, a case manager (with training in depression and anxiety), and a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist. The case manager has regular contact with the person and organises care, together with the medical doctor and specialist. The case manager may offer help with medication, or access to a ‘talking therapy’ to help the patient get better. Collaborative care has been tested with patients in a number of countries and health care systems, but it is not clear whether it should be recommended for people with depression or anxiety. In this review we found 79 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (90 comparisons) including 24,308 patients worldwide, comparing collaborative care with routine care or alternative treatments (such as consultation‐liaison) for depression and anxiety. There were problems with the methods in some of the studies. For example, the methods used to allocate patients to collaborative care or routine care were not always free from bias, and many patients did not complete follow‐up or provide information about their outcomes. Most of the studies focused on depression and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is better than routine care in improving depression for up to two years. A smaller number of studies examined the effect of collaborative care on anxiety and the evidence suggests that collaborative care is also better than usual care in improving anxiety for up to two years. Collaborative care increases the number of patients using medication in line with current guidance, and can improve mental health related quality of life. Patients with depression and anxiety treated with collaborative care are also more satisfied with their treatment.

AB: Abstract - Background Psychotropic drugs are associated with sexual dysfunction. Symptoms may concern penile erection, lubrication, orgasm, libido, retrograde ejaculation, sexual arousal, or overall sexual satisfaction. These are major aspects of tolerability and can highly affect patients’ compliance. Objectives To determine the effects of different strategies (e.g. dose reduction, drug holidays, adjunctive medication, switching to another drug) for treatment of sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotic therapy. Search methods An updated search was performed in the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (3 May 2012) and the references of all identified studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials involving people with schizophrenia and sexual dysfunction. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated random effects risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), for crossover trials we calculated Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% CI. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) on the basis of a random‐effects model. We analysed cross‐over trials under consideration of correlation of paired measures. Main results Currently this review includes four pioneering studies (total n = 138 , duration two weeks to four months), two of which are cross‐over trials. One trial reported significantly more erections sufficient for penetration when receiving sildenafil compared with when receiving placebo (n = 32, MD 3.20 95% CI 1.83 to 4.57), a greater mean duration of erections (n = 32, MD 1.18 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84) and frequency of satisfactory intercourse (n = 32, MD 2.84 95% CI 1.61 to 4.07). The second trial found no evidence for selegiline as symptomatic treatment for antipsychotic‐induced sexual dysfunction compared with placebo (n = 10, MD change on Aizenberg's sexual functioning scale ‐0.40 95% CI ‐3.95 to 3.15). No evidence was found for switching to quetiapine from risperidone to improve sexual functioning (n = 36, MD ‐2.02 95% CI ‐5.79 to 1.75). One trial reported significant improvement in sexual functioning when participants switched from risperidone or an typical antipsychotic to olanzapine (n = 54, MD ‐0.80 95% CI ‐1.55 to ‐0.05). Authors' conclusions We are not confident that cross‐over studies are appropriate for this participant group as they are best for conditions that are stable and for interventions with no physiological and psychological carry‐over. Sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of antipsychotic‐induced sexual dysfunction in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small short trial. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was a small, open label trial. Further well designed randomised control trials that are blinded and well conducted and reported, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, symptomatic therapy and switching antipsychotic on sexual function in people with antipsychotic‐induced sexual dysfunction are urgently needed. Plain language summary Management of sexual problems due to antipsychotic drug therapy Drugs commonly used to treat schizophrenia often cause sexual problems.This may affect erection, lubrication, orgasm, desire or libido, ejaculation, sexual arousal or overall sexual satisfaction. This may have serious negative consequences such as putting people off taking their medication or stopping taking drugs at an early stage. Sexual problems may limit a person’s quality of life, worsen self‐esteem and cause relationship problems.Strategies to manage these sexual problems are taking additional drugs (Viagra  TM ), short drug holidays when people temporarily stop antipsychotic medication, reduction of dose and switching to another antipsychotic drug. This review includes four pioneering studies with a total of 138 participants lasting between two weeks to four months, meaning all were small and quite short. Two of the studies compared the effects of drugs to treat sexual problems and two compared the effect of switching to a different antipsychotic drug (while remaining on a current antipsychotic). There is some evidence that sildenafil ((Viagra TM , Revatio TM )) may be a good treatment for men who have problems getting and maintaining an erection. It also seems to increase frequency and satisfaction of sexual intercourse. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women. However, before confident claims can be made, much more research on strategies to deal with sexual problems should be undertaken. Sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of sexual problems in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small, short trial. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was small. Further well designed trials and research, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, taking drugs such as Viagra  TM , and switching antipsychotic medication, are much needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia and this has serious implications for a patient's health and well being. Switching strategies have been recommended as a management option. Objectives To determine the effects of antipsychotic medication switching as a strategy for reducing or preventing weight gain and metabolic problems in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (January 2005 and June 2007), reference sections within relevant papers and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information. We updated this search November 2012 and added 167 new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria All clinical randomised controlled trials comparing switching of antipsychotic medication as an intervention for antipsychotic induced weight gain and metabolic problems with continuation of medication and/or other weight loss treatments (pharmacological and non pharmacological) in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Data collection and analysis Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a fixed‐effect model. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, metabolic syndrome, relapse and general mental state. Main results We included four studies for the review with a total of 636 participants. All except one study had a duration of 26 weeks or less. There was a mean weight loss of 1.94 kg (2 RCT, n = 287, CI ‐3.9 to 0.08) when switched to aripiprazole or quetiapine from olanzapine. BMI also decreased when switched to quetiapine (1 RCT, n = 129, MD ‐0.52 CI ‐1.26 to 0.22) and aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 173, RR 0.28 CI 0.13 to 0.57) from olanzapine. Fasting blood glucose showed a significant decrease when switched to aripiprazole or quetiapine from olanzapine. (2 RCT, MD ‐2.53 n = 280 CI ‐2.94 to ‐2.11). One RCT also showed a favourable lipid profile when switched to aripiprazole but these measures were reported as percentage changes, rather than means with standard deviation. People are less likely to leave the study early if they remain on olanzapine compared to switching to quetiapine or aripiprazole. There was no significant difference in outcomes of mental state, global state, and adverse events between groups which switched medications and those that remained on previous medication. Three different switching strategies were compared and no strategy was found to be superior to the others for outcomes of weight gain, mental state and global state. Authors' conclusions Evidence from this review suggests that switching antipsychotic medication to one with lesser potential for causing weight gain or metabolic problems could be an effective way to manage these side effects, but the data were weak due to the limited number of trials in this area and small sample sizes. Poor reporting of data also hindered using some trials and outcomes. There was no difference in mental state, global state and other treatment related adverse events between switching to another medication and continuing on the previous one. When the three switching strategies were compared none of them had an advantage over the others in their effects on the primary outcomes considered in this review. Better designed trials with adequate power would provide more convincing evidence for using medication switching as an intervention strategy. Note: the 167 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Can changing antipsychotic medication improve side effects like increases in weight, blood sugar and cholesterol? Weight gain is common among people with schizophrenia. The medication commonly used to treat schizophrenia may cause substantial weight gain. This weight gain could be treated through lifestyle interventions that increase physical activity or change diet; or through using other forms of medication that might help with weight loss. However, an easier alternative might be changing the antipsychotic medication to one that causes less weight gain. This review examines evidence for this possibility. Switching antipsychotic medication did show some reduction in weight and also contributed broader health benefits such as reducing fasting blood glucose. Notably, there were no significant difference in outcomes of mental state, global state and adverse events between groups which switched medications and those that remained on previous medication.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a highly prevalent and chronic disorder that comprises a wide range of symptomatology. Asenapine is a recently developed atypical antipsychotic that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia. Objectives To determine the clinical effects of asenapine for adults with schizophrenia or other schizophrenia‐like disorders by comparing it with placebo. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (July 04, 2014) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitation for inclusion of records into the register. We inspected references of all included studies for further relevant studies. Selection criteria Our review includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing asenapine with placebo in adults (however defined) with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder, again, by any means of diagnosis. Data collection and analysis We inspected citations from the searches and identified relevant abstracts, and extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and for continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table which included our outcomes of interest, where possible. We used a fixed‐effect model for our analyses. Main results We obtained and scrutinised 41 potentially relevant records, and from these we could include only six trials (n = 1835). Five of the six trials had high risk of attrition bias and all trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Results showed a clinically important change in global state (1 RCT, n = 336, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97, low‐quality evidence) and mental state (1 RCT, n = 336, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86, very low‐quality evidence) at short‐term amongst people receiving asenapine. People receiving asenapine demonstrated significant reductions in negative symptoms (1 RCT, n = 336, MD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐2.29 to 0.09, very low‐quality evidence) at short‐term. Individuals receiving asenapine demonstrated significantly fewer incidents of serious adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 386, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.63, very low‐quality evidence) at medium‐term. There was no clear difference in people discontinuing the study for any reason between asenapine and placebo at short‐term (5 RCTs, n = 1046, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04, very low‐quality evidence). No trial reported data for extrapyramidal symptoms or costs. Authors' conclusions There is some, albeit preliminary, evidence that asenapine provides an improvement in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms, whilst minimising the risk of adverse effects. However due to the low‐quality and limited quantity of evidence, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for people with schizophrenia. We identify a need for large‐scale, longer‐term, better‐designed and conducted randomised controlled trials investigating the clinical effects and safety of asenapine. Plain language summary Asenapine versus placebo for schizophrenia Review question Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the early‐to‐mid 1990s. The review looks at the effects of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo. Background People with schizophrenia often have 'positive symptoms', such as hearing voices, seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions). People also have 'negative symptoms', including loss of emotions, apathy, social withdrawal, lack of pleasure and difficulty speaking and communicating. Disorder of thoughts, anxiety and depression are common. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs, which are divided into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). These drugs often have severe side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, involuntary shaking and tiredness. Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the 1990s. At present there are no systematic reviews assessing the effects of this drug. Study characteristics The review includes six trials with 1835 people. The trials randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either asenapine or placebo. Five of these trials had high rates of people leaving early and were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Key results There is some evidence that asenapine, when compared to placebo, improves the positive, negative and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia while having less risk of debilitating side effects. Quality of the evidence However, due to the low quantity and limited quality of evidence currently available, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for schizophrenia. There is a need for large‐scale, longer‐term follow up, and bias‐free randomised controlled trials investigating the effects and safety of asenapine.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with just antipsychotic drug treatment and various adjunct medications are used to promote additional response. The antiepileptic carbamazepine is one such drug. Objectives To examine whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychoses and whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine augmentation of neuroleptic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses. Search methods For the original version we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (December 2001),  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE (1966‐2001), EMBASE (1980‐2001), Biological Abstracts (1980‐2001), PsycLIT (1886‐2001) and PSYNDEX (1974‐2001). For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials in July 2012. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carbamazepine or compounds of the carbamazepine family with placebo or no intervention, whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect, risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The updated search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. The number of included studies therefore remains at 10 with the number of participants randomised still 283. One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months. No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n = 31, RR 1.07 CI 0.78 to 1.45). Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia. No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores (1 RCT n = 38, RR 1.23 CI 0.78 to 1.92). A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n = 38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.043). Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo, we were able use GRADE for quality of evidence for these results. Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n = 182, RR 0.47 CI 0.16 to 1.35,  very low quality evidence ). Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2 RCTs n = 38, RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.88). There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n = 147, RR 0.86 CI 0.67 to 1.12,  low quality evidence ). Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.38 CI 0.14 to 1.02). No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder. Authors' conclusions Based on currently available randomised trial‐derived evidence, carbamazepine cannot be recommended for routine clinical use for treatment or augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. At present large, simple well‐designed and reported trials are justified ‐ especially if focusing on people with violent episodes and people with schizoaffective disorders or those with both schizophrenia and EEG abnormalities. Plain language summary Carbamazepine for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia will often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). They may also experience apathy, tiredness, lack of drive and disorganised thoughts and behaviour. These symptoms make schizophrenia a severe illness that affects many people throughout their life. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, although this medication is successful in treating the majority of people, 5% to 15% will continue to suffer from debilitating symptoms. For these people, several treatment options are available: changing the dose of medication; switching to another antipsychotic drug; or taking additional drugs that are not antipsychotics. Carbamazepine is a drug first used to treat epilepsy in the 1950s. It is also used as a mood stabiliser when people change between ‘high’ and ‘low’ moods (for example bi‐polar affective disorder). Side effects of carbamazepine include: poor coordination, headaches and drowsiness. This review focuses on the effectiveness of carbamazepine for people with schizophrenia. A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register was carried out July 2012. Ten studies were found with 283 people. Carbamazepine was compared with no active medication (‘dummy’ or placebo treatment), versus an antipsychotic or when taken in addition to an antipsychotic. However, all of the 10 studies were small and information in them was of a poor standard. There is therefore a lack of evidence whether carbamazepine reduces symptoms and side effects in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Larger well‐designed trials are necessary to provide stronger evidence before carbamazepine can be recommended as a treatment for people with schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background The use of antidepressants in dementia accompanied by depressive symptoms is widespread, but their clinical efficacy is uncertain. This review updates an earlier version, first published in 2002. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of any type of antidepressant for patients who have been diagnosed as having dementia of any type and depression as defined by recognised criteria. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register, on 16 August 2017. ALOIS contains information on trials retrieved from databases and from a number of trial registers and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included all relevant double‐blind, randomised trials comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo, for patients diagnosed as having dementia and depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors selected studies for inclusion and extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Where clinically appropriate, we pooled data for treatment periods up to three months and from three to nine months. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Main results We included ten studies with a total of 1592 patients. Eight included studies reported sufficiently detailed results to enter into analyses related to antidepressant efficacy. We split one study which included two different antidepressants and therefore had nine groups of patients treated with antidepressants compared with nine groups receiving placebo treatment. Information needed to make 'Risk of bias' judgements was often missing. We found high‐quality evidence of little or no difference in scores on depression symptom rating scales between the antidepressant and placebo treated groups after 6 to 13 weeks (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.26 to 0.06; 614 participants; 8 studies). There was probably also little or no difference between groups after six to nine months (mean difference (MD) 0.59 point, 95% CI ‐1.12 to 2.3, 357 participants; 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). The evidence on response rates at 12 weeks was of low quality, and imprecision in the result meant we were uncertain of any effect of antidepressants (antidepressant: 49.1%, placebo: 37.7%; odds ratio (OR) 1.71, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.67; 116 participants; 3 studies). However, the remission rate was probably higher in the antidepressant group than the placebo group (antidepressant: 40%, placebo: 21.7%; OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.59; 240 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). The largest of these studies continued for another 12 weeks, but because of imprecision of the result we could not be sure of any effect of antidepressants on remission rates after 24 weeks. There was evidence of no effect of antidepressants on performance of activities of daily living at weeks 6 to 13 (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.25; 173 participants; 4 studies; high‐quality evidence) and probably also little or no effect on cognition (MD 0.33 point on the Mini‐Mental State Examination, 95% CI ‐1.31 to 1.96; 194 participants; 6 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Participants on antidepressants were probably more likely to drop out of treatment than those on placebo over 6 to 13 weeks (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.14; 836 participants; 9 studies). The meta‐analysis of the number of participants suffering at least one adverse event showed a significant difference in favour of placebo (antidepressant: 49.2%, placebo: 38.4%; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.98, 1073 participants; 3 studies), as did the analyses for participants suffering one event of dry mouth (antidepressant: 19.6%, placebo: 13.3%; OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.63, 1044 participants; 5 studies), and one event of dizziness (antidepressant: 19.2%, placebo: 12.5%; OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.98, 1044 participants; 5 studies). Heterogeneity in the way adverse events were reported in studies presented a major difficulty for meta‐analysis, but there was some evidence that antidepressant treatment causes more adverse effects than placebo treatment does. Authors' conclusions The available evidence is of variable quality and does not provide strong support for the efficacy of antidepressants for treating depression in dementia, especially beyond 12 weeks. On the only measure of efficacy for which we had high‐quality evidence (depression rating scale scores), antidepressants showed little or no effect. The evidence on remission rates favoured antidepressants but was of moderate quality, so future research may find a different result. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about individual antidepressant drugs or about subtypes of dementia or depression. There is some evidence that antidepressant treatment may cause adverse events. Plain language summary Antidepressants for treating depression in dementia Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antidepressants on depression in people with dementia. Background Depression can be hard to recognise in people with dementia, but there is evidence that it is common and associated with increased disability, poorer quality of life, and shorter life expectancy. Many people with dementia are prescribed antidepressants to treat depression, but there is uncertainty about how effective this is. This review updates an earlier version, first published in 2002. Search date We searched up to August 2017 for relevant studies. Study characteristics We found ten studies with 1592 people to include in the review. On average, the studies lasted only 12 weeks, although one study ran for nine months. Each of them used a set of formal criteria to diagnose both depression and dementia and compared an antidepressant against a dummy pill (placebo). The older studies used more old‐fashioned antidepressants (imipramine, clomipramine, and moclobemide) and the newer studies used more modern ones, such as venlafaxine, mirtazapine and so‐called SSRI antidepressants (sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram and escitalopram). The people taking part in the studies had an average age of 75 and they had mild or moderate dementia. With the exception of two studies, they were being treated as outpatients. Key results We found that there was little or no difference in scores on depression rating scales between people treated with antidepressants and those treated with placebo for 12 weeks. The evidence to support this finding was of high quality, which suggests that further research is unlikely to find a different result. There was probably also little or no difference after six to nine months of treatment. Another way to assess the effect of antidepressants is to count the number of people in the antidepressant and placebo groups who show significant clinical improvement (response) or who recover from depression (remission). There was low‐quality evidence on the number of people showing a significant clinical improvement and the result was imprecise so we were unable to be sure of any effect on this measure. People taking an antidepressant were probably more likely to recover from depression than were those taking placebo (antidepressant: 40%, placebo: 21.7%). There was moderate‐quality evidence for this finding, so it is possible that further research could find a different result. We found that antidepressants did not affect the ability to manage daily activities and probably had little or no effect on a test of cognitive function (which includes attention, memory, and language). People taking an antidepressant were probably more likely to drop out of treatment and to have at least one unwanted side effect. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence varied, mainly due to poorly conducted studies and problems with the relevance of the outcome measures used. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the different results on depression rating scales and recovery rates, as evidence was of a higher quality for the former than for the latter. Another major problem is that side effects are very rarely well‐reported in studies. Therefore, further research will still be useful to reach conclusions that are more reliable and can better help doctors and patients to know what works for whom.

AB: Abstract - Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review ‐ one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD ‐ focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non‐pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery and form of light vary. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD and improving patient‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non‐randomised studies. We intended to include studies that compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus no treatment/placebo, second‐generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes, negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy in combination with any comparator intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications, independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Main results We identified 3745 citations after de‐duplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review. We assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria. The included RCT had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis. The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light treatment. Overall, white light and infrared light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy. In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and 67% (6/9) in the non‐treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38; 23 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy, but the CI was also too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; 24 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Comparison of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28; 29 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Reasons for downgrading evidence quality included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self‐rating of outcomes, lack of checking of compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions of interest such as second‐generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors' conclusions Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for people with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Plain language summary Light therapy for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has relatives and friends who have experienced winter depression. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning light therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms could help to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review was to find out whether light therapy can prevent the onset of depression in winter when it is used in healthy people with a history of winter depression, and if it is safe. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way, but it is of importance for those who have suffered winter depression. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to 19 June 2018 for studies on light therapy to prevent winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received light therapy or no treatment. All individuals in these studies had a history of winter depression. What does the evidence from the review reveal? The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low, so we can draw no conclusions about whether light therapy is effective in preventing winter depression. The included study provided no information on side effects of light therapy. Doctors need to discuss with patients considering preventive treatment the advantages and disadvantages of light therapy and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, treatment selection should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare light therapy versus other treatments, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression.

AB: Abstract - Background Torture is widespread, with potentially broad and long‐lasting impact across physical, psychological, social and other areas of life. Its complex and diverse effects interact with ethnicity, gender, and refugee experience. Health and welfare agencies offer varied rehabilitation services, from conventional mental health treatment to eclectic or needs‐based interventions. This review is needed because relatively little outcome research has been done in this field, and no previous systematic review has been conducted. Resources are scarce, and the challenges of providing services can be considerable. Objectives To assess beneficial and adverse effects of psychological, social and welfare interventions for torture survivors, and to compare these effects with those reported by active and inactive controls. Search methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through a search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Specialised Register (CCDANCTR), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), the Open System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) all years to 11 April 2013; searches of Cochrane resources, international trial registries and the main biomedical databases were updated on 20 June 2014. We also searched the Online Library of Dignity (Danish Institute against Torture), reference lists of reviews and included studies and the most frequently cited journals, up to April 2013 but not repeated for 2014. Investigators were contacted to provide updates or details as necessary. Selection criteria Full publications of RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of psychological, social or welfare interventions for survivors of torture against any active or inactive comparison condition. Data collection and analysis We included all major sources of grey literature in our search and used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration for collecting data, evaluating risk of bias and using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence. Main results Nine RCTs were included in this review. All were of psychological interventions; none provided social or welfare interventions. The nine trials provided data for 507 adults; none involved children or adolescents. Eight of the nine studies described individual treatment, and one discussed group treatment. Six trials were conducted in Europe, and three in different African countries. Most people were refugees in their thirties and forties; most met the criteria for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the outset. Four trials used narrative exposure therapy (NET), one cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and the other four used mixed methods for trauma symptoms, one of which included reconciliation methods. Five interventions were compared with active controls, such as psychoeducation; four used treatment as usual or waiting list/no treatment; we analysed all control conditions together. Duration of therapy varied from one hour to longer than 20 hours with a median of around 12 to 15 hours. All trials reported effects on distress and on PTSD, and two reported on quality of life. Five studies followed up participants for at least six months. No immediate benefits of psychological therapy were noted in comparison with controls in terms of our primary outcome of distress (usually depression), nor for PTSD symptoms, PTSD caseness, or quality of life. At six‐month follow‐up, three NET and one CBT study (86 participants) showed moderate effect sizes for intervention over control in reduction of distress (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.07 to ‐0.19) and of PTSD symptoms (SMD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.07). However, the quality of evidence was very low, and risk of bias resulted from researcher/therapist allegiance to treatment methods, effects of uncertain asylum status of some people and real‐time non‐standardised translation of assessment measures. No measures of adverse events were described, nor of participation, social functioning, quantity of social or family relationships, proxy measures by third parties or satisfaction with treatment. Too few studies were identified for review authors to attempt sensitivity analyses. Authors' conclusions Very low‐quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of immediate effects on post‐traumatic symptoms, distress or quality of life; however, NET and CBT were found to confer moderate benefits in reducing distress and PTSD symptoms over the medium term (six months after treatment). Evidence was of very low quality, mainly because non‐standardised assessment methods using interpreters were applied, and sample sizes were very small. Most eligible trials also revealed medium to high risk of bias. Further, attention to the cultural appropriateness of interventions or to their psychometric qualities was inadequate, and assessment measures used were unsuitable. As such, these findings should be interpreted with caution. No data were available on whether symptom reduction enabled improvements in quality of life, participation in community life, or in social and family relationships in the medium term. Details of adverse events and treatment satisfaction were not available immediately after treatment nor in the medium term. Future research should aim to address these gaps in the evidence and should include larger sample sizes when possible. Problems of torture survivors need to be defined far more broadly than by PTSD symptoms, and recognition given to the contextual influences of being a torture survivor, including as an asylum seeker or refugee, on psychological and social health. Plain language summary Psychological, social and welfare interventions for the psychological health and well‐being of torture survivors Why is this review important? Torture is a widespread problem that can cause lasting and severe physical, psychological, social and welfare problems for survivors. Treatment is offered by various agencies: some provide support in diverse settings from refugee camps to high‐income countries; others support survivors in countries where current or recent repression or armed conflict is known. Resources for these services are scarce, so it is important that they are used to greatest effect to improve the well‐being of torture survivors. Who will be interested in this review? Agencies providing health and welfare services for torture survivors; organisations that fund these agencies; torture survivors and those close to them. What questions does this review aim to answer? What intervention improves well‐being among torture survivors with psychological, social and welfare problems? Which studies were included in the review? We searched the academic literature and the non‐academic literature such as reports of non‐governmental agencies providing services to April 2013, and again to June 2014. Studies had to describe a randomised controlled trial of intervention for psychological, social or welfare problems among torture survivors—adults or children. We found nine trials with 507 adults that examined varied psychological interventions compared with no treatment or a credible alternative treatment. Six trials were conducted at treatment centres in Europe, and three in African refugee settings; all focused on post‐traumatic stress and were of low to moderate quality. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Very low‐quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of an immediate effect on post‐traumatic symptoms, distress or quality of life. However, at six‐month follow‐up, four studies (86 people) showed moderate benefit in terms of post‐traumatic stress and distress. Three trials were of narrative exposure therapy, and one of cognitive‐behavioural therapy, but we have little confidence in these results because the evidence was of very low quality and the trials included very small numbers of people. No studies assessed worsening of problems, nor changes in family and social relationships or community participation, with or without improvement in symptoms. What should happen next? Studies need to identify broader aims for intervention and should continue to test a range of interventions consistent with the breadth of problems of torture survivors. Investigators also need to assess changes with validity across cultures and languages.

AB: Abstract - Background Depressive disorders are the most common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy, affecting around one‐third, with a significant negative impact on quality of life. There is concern that patients may not be receiving appropriate treatment for their depression because of uncertainty regarding which antidepressant or class works best and the perceived risk of exacerbating seizures. This review aims to address these issues and inform clinical practice and future research. Objectives We aimed to review and synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials of antidepressants and prospective non‐randomised studies of antidepressants used for treating depression in patients with epilepsy. The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms and the effect on seizure recurrence. Search methods We conducted a search of the following databases: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (Ovid), SCOPUS, PsycINFO, www.clinicaltrials.gov and conference proceedings, including studies published up to 31 May 2014. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non‐randomised cohort controlled and uncontrolled studies investigating children or adults with epilepsy treated with an antidepressant for depressive symptoms. The intervention group consisted of patients receiving an antidepressant drug in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen. The control group(s) consisted of patients receiving a placebo, comparative antidepressant, psychotherapy or no treatment in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen. Data collection and analysis We extracted data on trial design factors, patient demographics and outcomes for each study. The primary outcomes were changes in depression scores (proportion with a greater than 50% improvement or mean difference) and change in seizure frequency (mean difference or proportion with a seizure recurrence or episode of status epilepticus, or both). Secondary outcomes included the number of patients withdrawing from the study and reasons for withdrawal, as well as any adverse events. Two authors undertook data extraction separately for each included study. We then cross‐checked the data extraction. We assessed risk of bias using a version of the extended Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in both randomised and non‐randomised studies. We presented binary outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We presented continuous outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs, and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. If possible we intended to use meta‐regression techniques to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity however this was not possible due to lack of data. Main results We included in the review eight studies (three RCTs and five prospective cohort studies) including 471 patients with epilepsy treated with an antidepressant. The RCTs were all single‐centre studies comparing an antidepressant versus active control, placebo or no treatment. The five non‐randomised prospective cohort studies reported on outcomes mainly in patients with partial epilepsy treated for depression with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We rated all the RCTs and one prospective cohort study as having unclear risk of bias. We rated the four other prospective cohort studies as having high risk of bias. We were unable to perform any meta‐analysis for the proportion with a greater than 50% improvement in depression scores because the studies reported on different treatment comparisons. The results are presented descriptively and show a varied responder rate of between 24% and 97%, depending on the antidepressant given. For the mean difference in depression score we were able to perform a limited meta‐analysis of two prospective cohort studies of citalopram, including a total of 88 patients. This gave low quality evidence for the effect estimate of 1.17 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.38) in depression scores. Seizure frequency data were not reported in any RCTs and we were unable to perform any meta‐analysis for prospective cohort studies due to the different treatment comparisons. The results are presented descriptively and show that treatment in three studies with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor did not significantly increase seizure frequency. Patients given an antidepressant were more likely to withdraw due to adverse events than inefficacy. Reported adverse events for SSRIs included nausea, dizziness, sedation, gastrointestinal disturbance and sexual dysfunction. Across three comparisons we rated the evidence as moderate quality due to the small sizes of the contributing studies and only one study each contributing to the comparisons. We rated the evidence for the final comparison as low quality as there was concern over the study methods in the two contributing studies. Authors' conclusions Existing evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms associated with epilepsy is very limited. Only one small RCT demonstrated a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine on depressive symptoms. We have no high quality evidence to inform the choice of antidepressant drug or class of drug in treating depression in people with epilepsy. This review provides low quality evidence of safety in terms of seizure exacerbation with SSRIs, but there are no available comparative data on antidepressant classes and safety in relation to seizures. There are currently no comparative data on antidepressants and psychotherapy in treating depression in epilepsy, although psychotherapy could be considered in patients unwilling to take antidepressants or where there are unacceptable side effects. Further comparative clinical trials of antidepressants and psychotherapy in large cohorts of patients with epilepsy and depression are required to better inform treatment policy in the future. Plain language summary Antidepressants for people with epilepsy and depression Background Depressive disorders occur in approximately one‐third of people with epilepsy, often requiring antidepressant treatment. However, depression often goes untreated in people with epilepsy, partly due to fear that antidepressants might cause seizures. There are different classes of antidepressants, however they all aim to increase key neurotransmitters in the brain, thereby alleviating depressive symptoms. Characteristics of studies We carried out a search of databases on 31 May 2014. We found eight studies that included 471 patients with epilepsy treated with an antidepressant. Three were randomised controlled trials and five were non‐randomised prospective cohort studies. The studies observed the effect of different antidepressants, mainly a class of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Results Taking all the evidence into account, the review found that there is very limited evidence demonstrating a significant effect of antidepressants on depressive symptoms in epilepsy. There was limited information on the effect of antidepressants on seizure control, however in the studies reporting this outcome there did not appear to be any significant worsening of seizures. Quality of the studies We assessed the studies with regard to bias and quality. Overall the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate for the clinical trials and low for the non‐randomised prospective cohort studies. More high quality, larger trials of antidepressants are needed to examine how different classes of antidepressant compare and what impact they are likely to have on seizure control.

AB: Abstract - Background Levomepromazine is an 'older' typical antipsychotic medication licensed for use in schizophrenia but sparingly prescribed in the United Kingdom. Objectives To determine the clinical effects and safety of levomepromazine compared with placebo or antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2008) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised trials comparing levomepromazine with placebo or other antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses were included. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated relative risk (RR) (random‐effects model), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. We avoided the use of number needed to harm (NNH), as an alternative we used number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) to indicate the direction of effect. For continuous outcomes, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results The review currently includes 4 RCTs with 192 participants. For our primary outcome of leaving the study early, levomepromazine was not significantly different compared with other antipsychotics. The levomepromazine arm was significantly better on CGI severity compared with chlorpromazine (n=38, 1 RCT, WMD ‐0.80 CI ‐1.51 to ‐0.09). Risperidone was better for CGI endpoint scores (n=42, 1 RCT, RR 2.33 CI 1.11 to 4.89, NNT 3 CI 2 to 10) compared with levomepromazine. Recipients given levomepromazine had a better BPRS endpoint score (n=38, 1 RCT, WMD ‐9.00, CI ‐17.46 to ‐0.54) and PANSS total score (n=38, 1 RCT, WMD ‐15.90, CI ‐30.30 to ‐1.50) than chlorpromazine. Risperidone recipients noticed a significant difference for the outcome 'at least 20% reduction' on BPRS endpoint score (n=42, 1 RCT, RR 3.33 CI 1.07 to 10.42, NNT 3 CI 2 to 14) compared with levomepromazine. Levomepromazine caused less tremor (n=41, 1 RCT RR 0.12 CI 0.02 to 0.87 NNTB 3 CI 2 to 8), less antiparkinsonian medication administration (n=79, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.17 to 0.90, NNTB 5, CI 2 to 21) compared with haloperidol. Levomepromazine caused less akathisia compared with chlorpromazine, but more hypotension compared with risperidone (n=42, 1 RCT, RR 2.50 CI 1.21 to 5.18, NNTH 3, CI 2 to 7). Dizziness was common with levomepromazine compared with other antipsychotic medications. Authors' conclusions Available data does not enable us to confidently comment on the effectiveness of levomepromazine for schizophrenia. Larger, more robust, studies comparing levomepromazine with other antipsychotics including clozapine are much needed. Plain language summary Levomepromazine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a profoundly disabling mental illness affecting thoughts, emotions and behaviour. It has a life time prevalence of about 1%. Antipsychotic medications still remain as the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical subtypes. First generation or typical antipsychotic medications have been the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia for decades and have been effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms have been fairly resistant to treatment. With the advent of atypical antipsychotics there has been a surge in prescriptions of the atypical antipsychotic medications in recent years. Levomepromazine is one among these 'older' typical antipsychotic medications. We systematically reviewed the effects of levomepromazine in comparison to other typical and atypical antipsychotic medications for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like disorders. We were able to include four studies in our systematic review.

AB: Abstract - Background Cognitive deficits are common in people who have received cranial irradiation and have a serious impact on daily functioning and quality of life. The benefit of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment of cognitive deficits in this population is unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing or ameliorating cognitive deficits in adult patients treated with cranial irradiation. Search methods In August 2014. we searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO and checked the reference lists of included studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov, the Physicians Data Query and the Meta Register of Controlled Trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions in cranial irradiated adults, with objective cognitive functioning as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (JD, KZ) independently extracted data from selected studies and carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment. Cognitive function, fatigue and mood outcomes were reported. No data were pooled. Main results Sixteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review, six of which were included. Three studies investigated prevention and three studies investigated amelioration. Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta‐analysis was not possible. Two studies investigated a pharmacological intervention for the prevention of cognitive deficits; memantine compared with placebo, and d‐threo‐methylphenidate HCL compared with placebo. In the first study the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups. The second study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events. The third study investigated a rehabilitation program for the prevention of cognitive deficits but did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups. Three studies investigated the use of a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of cognitive deficits; methylphenidate compared with modafinil, two different doses of modafinil, and donepezil compared with placebo. The first study found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported. The second study combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported. Both studies were limited by a small sample size. The third study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported. No non‐pharmacological studies for the amelioration of cognitive deficits were eligible. There were a number of limitations across studies but few without high risks of bias. Authors' conclusions There is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation. There is supportive evidence that donepezil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with primary or metastatic brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation. Patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of both studies. Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher quality of evidence. There is no strong evidence to support any non‐pharmacological interventions (medical or cognitive/behavioural) in the prevention or amelioration of cognitive deficits. Non‐randomised studies appear promising but are as yet to be conclusive via translation into high quality evidence. Further research is required. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing and ameliorating cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation Background Problems with mental activities (cognitive deficits) are common in patients who have received radiation to the brain for a primary or secondary (metastatic) brain tumour, or to help prevent a tumour spreading to the brain from elsewhere in the body. This toxic side effect of brain radiation may be acute (during treatment) or early after treatment (one to six months) and may be reversible. However, late toxicities may occur many months or years later and are generally irreversible and are slowly progressive. Late cognitive deficits, such as memory loss, problems planning tasks or behavioural changes, can have a serious impact on quality of life and the ability to carrying out activities normally. Interventions to help prevent or treat these late radiation toxicities may improve a patient's well‐being. Study Characteristics In August 2014 we searched four literature databases. Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in which patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or a comparison group (control group), were eligible for inclusion. Each trial assessed different interventions, so results were not combined. The largest trial investigated the medical drug memantine in 508 patients with a metastatic brain tumour. Another trial investigated donepezil in 198 patients with a primary or secondary brain tumour. The other trials were smaller and investigated modafinil and methylphenidate. We found one psychological intervention for preventing cognitive deficits during brain radiation. There is one ongoing medical drug trial recruiting participants. There were many non‐randomised and non‐controlled trials that offer promising results for further exploration using an RCT method. Key findings Findings into the efficacy of memantine offer supportive evidence for preventing cognitive deficits in patients with a secondary brain tumour receiving brain irradiation. Findings into the efficacy of donepezil offer some support for its use in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in patients with a primary or secondary tumour previously treated with radiation. The remaining studies did not have a sufficient number of participants to provide reliable results. The drugs used had few side effects (adverse events), although these were not reported well. Recruitment and retention of trial participants for these medical drug studies is difficult. Quality of the evidence We found limitations in the evidence across studies, most medical drug randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, whereas the psychological interventions were at a high risk of bias.

AB: Abstract - Background Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) is widely used for treating vascular dementia (VaD) in China. Recent studies of a number of TCHMs have demonstrated in vitro biological activity and therapeutic effects in animals, but the published clinical evidence has not been systematically appraised. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCHMs listed in either the  Chinese Pharmacopoeia  (CP) or the  Chinese National Essential Drug List  (NEDL) that are used to treat VaD. A secondary aim was to identify promising TCHMs for further clinical research. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register (on 14 March 2018) and also several Chinese biomedical databases: the Chinese Biological Medicine Database (January 1979 to May 2015), Wanfang database (January 1998 to May 2015), Chongqing VIP Information Co. Ltd or Weipu (January 1998 to May 2015) and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (January 1979 to May 2015). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of TCHMs compared to placebo, to Western medicine (WM) or to routine therapy for VaD risk factors. Eligible participants were men and women aged 18 years and above, diagnosed with VaD by any of the following four criteria: (1)  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM) versions III, III‐R, IV, IV‐TR; (2)  National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  (NINDS‐AIREN); (3)  International Classification of Diseases  9 or 10; (4) the Hachinski or the Modified Hachinski Ischaemic Score. We required the use of an imaging technique to differentiate VaD from other dementias. We excluded (1) trials with participants diagnosed with mixed dementia or those that did not use an imaging technique to ascertain VaD; (2) trials of NEDL‐listed Gingko biloba or Huperzine A as experimental interventions, to avoid duplication of existing Cochrane Reviews; (3) trials using acupuncture alone as the experimental intervention; (4) trials using another CP‐ or NEDL‐listed TCHM (except for Huperzine A and Gingko which are popular in Western practice) as the control intervention; and (5) trials using purely non‐pharmacological interventions as the control intervention unless explicitly described as 'routine therapy for VaD risk factors'. Data collection and analysis We assessed the risks of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and adapted the Outcome Reporting Bias in Trials (ORBIT) classification system for outcome reporting bias. We assessed TCHM effects on five clinically important outcomes: cognition, global performance, safety, activities of daily living and behaviour and summarised the effects using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios or risk differences for binary outcomes. We stratified the studies into those that estimated the TCHM versus 'no treatment' effect and those that estimated the TCHM versus the WM effect, with further stratification by the specific TCHM tested or by one of the four modes of action. We pooled using a random‐effects model. Due to substantial clinical and design heterogeneity, we did not estimate an 'overall TCHM effect'. Main results We only found studies (47 studies, 3581 participants) for 18 of the 29 eligible TCHMs as defined by our inclusion criteria. All were superiority trials conducted in China between 1997 and 2013, with most employing a two‐arm parallel design with sample sizes ranging from 26 to 240 and a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range: 2 to 24 weeks). We found that reporting and trial methodology were generally poor; in particular, there was a lack of information on randomisation, an absence of blinding of participants and outcome assessors and incomplete reporting of adverse events (AEs). None of the 30 trials published from 2007 onwards adopted the CONSORT recommendations for reporting RCTs of herbal interventions. We found seven TCHMs which each had potentially large benefits in studies estimating the TCHM versus 'no treatment' effect and in studies estimating the TCHM versus the WM effect. Two TCHMs (NaoXinTong and TongXinLuo) were common to both groups. Three of these TCHMs – Nao XinTong, NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo – had the strongest evidence to justify further research. Two TCHMs (NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo) had a 5% or more increased risk of AEs compared to the 'no Treatment' control, but the quality of this evidence was poor. Authors' conclusions We found moderate‐ to very low‐quality evidence of benefit and harm of TCHMs for VaD. Methodological inadequacies need to be addressed by better conducted and reported trials. We identified NaoMaiTai, NaoXinTong and TongXinLuo as warranting special research priority. Plain language summary Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for vascular dementia Background Vascular dementia is a common form of dementia which is caused by problems with the blood supply to the brain. Some but not all people with vascular dementia have had strokes. There are no Western medicines licensed to treat vascular dementia. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs) are often used to treat it in China. Review question We wanted to find out whether any TCHMs were effective treatments for vascular dementia and whether they had any harmful effects. We also wanted to identify promising TCHMs for further research. What we did We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which had studied the use of any TCHM listed in either the  Chinese Pharmacopoeia  (CP) or the  Chinese National Essential Drug List  (NEDL) for the treatment of vascular dementia. In these studies, participants should have been randomly assigned to either a group given the TCHM or to a comparison (control) group that did not get the TCHM, but may have been given a placebo (dummy pill), a Western medicine or standard medical treatment to reduce the risk of strokes. What we found We included 47 trials with 3581 participants of 18 TCHMs in this review. All were conducted in mainland China between 1997 and 2013 with participant numbers ranging from 26 to 240 and an average study duration of 12 weeks. There were significant problems with the methods in many of the trials, particularly with how participants were allocated to treatments, how outcomes were measured and how thoroughly harmful effects were monitored. For these and other reasons, we rated the overall quality of the evidence as variable, ranging from moderate to very low. This means that we are uncertain, and often very uncertain, about the accuracy of the results. Despite these reservations, we found seven TCHMs which each had potentially large benefits in studies comparing TCHMs to no treatment or Western Medicine. Three of these – Nao XinTong, NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo – had the strongest evidence to justify further research. We found that the risk of harmful effects was at least 5% higher than the risk for participants in the control group for NaoMaiTai and TongXinLuo, but the quality of this evidence was poor. Conclusion We think further research of some TCHMs for vascular dementia is justified, but it is important that the quality of trial conduct and reporting be improved by adhering to published best‐practice standards.

AB: Abstract - Background Wendan decoction (WDD) is one of the classical Chinese herb formulas used for psychotic symptoms. It is thought to be safe, accessible and inexpensive. Objectives To investigate the effects of WDD for treatment of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illness compared with placebo, antipsychotic drugs and other interventions for outcomes of clinical importance. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (February 2016), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, China biomedical databases group (SinoMed, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang) and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We also inspected references of identified studies and contacted relevant authors for additional information. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials with useable data comparing WDD with antipsychotics, placebo or other interventions for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean differences (MD) between groups and their 95% CIs. We employed a random‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included 15 randomised trials (1437 participants) of WDD for schizophrenia. There was a high risk of performance bias within the trials but overall, risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias was low or unclear. Data showed WDD improved the short‐term global state of participants compared with placebo or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73,  low‐quality evidence ). When WDD was compared with antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine or risperidone, no difference in short‐term global state of participants was observed (2 RCTs n = 140, RR 1.18 95% CI 0.98 to 1.43,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and mental state (total endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): 2 RCTs, n = 140, MD 0.84, 95% CI ‐4.17 to 5.84,  low‐quality evidence ). However, WDD was associated with fewer people experiencing extrapyramidal effects (EPS) compared with other treatments (2 RCTs 0/70 versus 47/70, n = 140, RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15,  moderate‐quality evidence ). WDD is often used as an add‐on intervention alongside antipsychotics. When WDD + antipsychotic was compared to antipsychotic alone, the combination group had better global state (short‐term results, 6 RCTs, n = 684, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.72,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and mental state (short‐term total endpoint PANSS: 5 RCTs, n = 580, MD ‐11.64, 95% CI ‐13.33 to ‐ 9.94,  low‐quality evidence ), fewer people with EPS (2 RCTs n = 308, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.70,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and reduction of the mean use of risperidone (1 RCT n = 107, MD ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.53,  low‐quality evidence ). But, there was no effect on weight gain (1 RCT n = 108, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24,  low‐quality evidence ). When WDD + low‐dose antipsychotic was compared with normal‐dose antipsychotic alone, the combination again showed benefits for short‐term global state (7 RCTs n = 522, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93,  moderate‐quality evidence ), mental state (total endpoint PANSS: 4 RCTs n = 250, MD ‐9.53, 95% CI ‐17.82 to ‐1.24,  low‐quality evidence ), and fewer participants with EPS (3 RCTS n = 280, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.51,  moderate‐quality evidence ). Across all comparisons, we found no data on outcomes directly reporting quality of life, hospital service use and economics. Authors' conclusions Limited evidence suggests that WDD may have some positive short‐term antipsychotic global effects compared to placebo or no treatment. However when WDD was compared with other antipsychotics there was no effect on global or mental state, but WDD was associated with fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic, positive effects were found for global and mental state and the combination caused fewer adverse effects. The available evidence is not high quality. Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Wendan decoction for schizophrenia Review question Is there trial‐based evidence that a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Wendan decoction (WDD) is effective for treatment of people with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness, characterised by profound disruptions in thinking that affects language, perception, and sense of self. People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things that are not present (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs, However, antipsychotic drugs can cause unpleasant side effects, particularly movement disorders, which can be severe enough to stop people from continuing treatment. Experiences from China suggest some Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM ‐ a system of medicine originated in China and encompassing characteristics of traditional Chinese philosophy and culture) approaches can have an antipsychotic effect while causing fewer side effects. Wendan decoction is one of the classical TCM prescriptions for severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. Searching for evidence In Feburary 2016, the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group ran an electronic search for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either WDD, placebo/no treatment or antipsychotic drugs. We screened all records found in this search and included those that met our inclusion criteria and reported useful data. Evidence found Fifteen trials (with a total of 1437 participants) provided useable, but limited, data. Results showed that WDD may have some beneficial effects on short‐term global outcomes and mental state of people with schizophrenia compared to placebo or no treatment but did not show a benefit when compared to antipsychotics ‐ although WDD did cause fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic, there were observed benefits for WDD on improving global state and reducing the side effects caused by antipsychotics. Conclusions Results of this review suggest WDD may be helpful for people with schizophrenia, but these results are based on low to moderate evidence and there is not enough high‐quality evidence to make firm conclusions. Better‐designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background Postnatal depression is a common disorder that can have adverse short‐ and long‐term effects on maternal morbidity, the new infant and the family as a whole. Treatment is often largely by social support and psychological interventions. It is not known whether antidepressants are an effective and safe choice for treatment of this disorder. This review was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressants and to compare their effectiveness with other forms of treatment, placebo or treatment as usual. It is an update of a review first published in 2001. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in comparison with any other treatment (psychological, psychosocial or pharmacological), placebo or treatment as usual for postnatal depression. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR) to 11 July 2014. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following bibliographic databases:  The Cochrane Library  (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE, (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched international trial registries and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field. Selection criteria We included RCTs of women with depression with onset up to six months postpartum that compared antidepressant treatment (alone or in combination with another treatment) with any other treatment, placebo or treatment as usual. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from the trial reports. We requested missing information from investigators wherever possible. We sought data to allow an intention‐to‐treat analysis. Random effects meta‐analyses were conducted to pool data where sufficient comparable studies were identified. Main results We included six trials with 596 participants in this review. All studies had a randomised controlled parallel group design, with two conducted in the UK, three in the US and one in Israel. Meta‐analyses were performed to pool data on response and remission from studies comparing antidepressants with placebo. No meta‐analyses could be conducted for other comparisons due to the small number of trials identified. Four studies compared selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with placebo (two using sertraline, one using paroxetine and one using fluoxetine; 233 participants in total). In two of these studies both the experimental and placebo groups also received psychological therapy. Pooled risk ratios based on data from three of these studies (146 participants) showed that women randomised to SSRIs had higher rates of response and remission than those randomised to placebo (response: RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.03; remission: RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.98); the fourth study did not report data on response or remission. One study (254 participants) compared antidepressant treatment with treatment as usual (for the first four weeks) followed by listening visits. The study found significantly higher rates of improvement in the antidepressant group than treatment‐as‐usual group after the first four weeks, but no difference between antidepressants and listening visits at the later follow‐up. In addition, one study comparing sertraline with nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) found no difference in effectiveness (109 participants). Side effects were experienced by a substantial proportion of women, but there was no evidence of a meaningful difference in the number of adverse effects between treatment arms in any study. There were very limited data on adverse effects experienced by breastfed infants, with no long‐term follow‐up. All but one of the studies were assessed as being at high or uncertain risk of attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. In particular, one of the placebo‐controlled studies had over 50% drop‐out. Authors' conclusions The evidence base for this review was very limited, with a small number of studies and little information on a number of important outcomes, particularly regarding potential effects on the child. Risk of bias, for example from high attrition rates, as well as low representativeness of participants (e.g. exclusion of women with severe or chronic depression in several trials) also limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Pooled estimates for response and remission found that SSRIs were significantly more effective than placebo for women with postnatal depression. However the quality of evidence contributing to this comparison was assessed as very low owing to the small sample size for this comparison (146 participants from three studies), the risk of bias in included studes and the inclusion of one study where all participants in both study arms additionally received psychological therapy. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether, and for whom, antidepressant or psychological/psychosocial treatments are more effective, or whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated than others. There is also inadequate evidence on whether the benefits of antidepressants persist beyond eight weeks or whether they have short‐ or long‐term adverse effects on breastfeeding infants. Professionals treating women with severe depression in the postnatal period will need to draw on other evidence, including trials among general adult populations and observational studies of antidepressant safety when breastfeeding (although the potential for confounding in non‐randomised studies must be considered). More RCTs are needed with larger sample sizes and longer follow‐up, including assessment of the impact on the child and safety of breastfeeding. Further larger‐scale trials comparing antidepressants with alternative treatment modalities are also required. Plain language summary Antidepressants for postnatal depression Why is this review important? Postnatal depression is a common disorder that can have short‐ and long‐term adverse effects on the mother, the new infant and the family as a whole. Antidepressants are commonly used as the first treatment option for adults with moderate to severe depression, but there is little evidence on whether antidepressants are an effective and safe choice for the treatment of this disorder in the postnatal period. This review was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressants and to compare their effectiveness with other forms of treatment (e.g. psychosocial interventions such as peer support, psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy), placebo or treatment as usual. Who will be interested in this review? Parents, professionals in primary care services who work with women of reproductive age, general practitioners, professionals in adult mental health services who work with women of reproductive age and professionals working in perinatal mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2001, which found insufficient evidence to make conclusions about antidepressant treatment in postnatal depression. Therefore, this update aims to answer the following question: What are the effects of antidepressants in comparison with other any other treatment, placebo or treatment as usual for postnatal depression? Which studies were included in the review? We searched clinical trials registries; the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group; and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group databases to find all high‐quality studies comparing antidepressants with any other form of treatment from the upper date limit of the most recent previous searches to July 2014. We contacted drug companies and experts in the field. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and had to include women with postnatal depression (onset of depression up to six months after giving birth) who were not taking any antidepressant medication at the start of the trial. We included six trials of 596 women in the review. Although many of the studies were well conducted and reported, there are some areas with substantial risk of bias; for example, through incomplete follow‐up (e.g. in one study over 50% of the participants dropped out prior to the primary outcome measurement). What does the evidence from the review tell us? The quality of evidence from this review was assessed as being very low quality due to the small number of studies, risk of bias in the included studies (in particular, high proportions of participants dropped out) and the fact that many studies excluded women with chronic (i.e. long lasting) or severe depression, or both. We were able to combine data from three studies comparing a type of commonly used antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with placebo. The results showed that women with postnatal depression who were given SSRIs were more likely to improve or recover than those given placebo. We were unable to combine the data from studies comparing antidepressants with other treatments or treatment as usual due to the very small number of studies identified for these comparisons. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether, and for whom, antidepressant or psychosocial/psychological treatments are more effective, or whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated (or both) than others. Conclusions were also limited by the lack of data on long‐term follow‐up, the safety of breastfeeding or child outcomes. What should happen next? Larger studies need to be done, and treatment decisions for women with postnatal depression will need to use evidence from other sources such as trials in general adult populations and observational studies of antidepressant safety in the postnatal period. The review authors recommend that future studies in this area should include women with severe postnatal depression, long‐term follow‐up on psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in mothers who have been treated for postnatal depression. In addition, more evidence is needed on outcomes for infants, particularly with regards to the safety of breastfeeding and effect of treatment for postnatal depression on the maternal‐infant relationship.

AB: Abstract - Background There are a number of studies that suggest a relationship between decline of melatonin function and the symptoms of dementia. Objectives The review assessed the evidence of clinical effectiveness of melatonin in the treatment of symptoms of dementia. Relevant primary outcomes were cognition, mood, behaviour, functions of daily living, and safety of melatonin use and secondary outcomes were quality of life, morbidity, mortality and length of time to institutionalization and caregiver stress. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 29 June 2009 using the terms: MELATONIN and N‐ACETYL‐5‐METHOXYTRYPTAMINE. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. The search of June 2009 retrieved several studies for consideration by the authors. Selection criteria All relevant, randomized controlled trials in which orally administered melatonin in any dosage was compared with a control group for the effect on managing cognitive, behavioral (excluding sleep), and mood disturbances of people with dementia of any degree of severity. Data collection and analysis Two to three reviewers independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and risk of bias, and extracted data from the selected studies. Statistically significant differences in end‐points or changes in outcomes from baseline to end of treatment between the melatonin and control groups were examined. Each study was summarized using a measure of effect (e.g. mean difference) and meta‐analyses were conducted when appropriate. Main results Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates of MMSE cognitive and ADAS‐cognitive change scores from three of these studies revealed non‐significant cognitive effects for melatonin treatment. In two of these studies, significant improvements in psychopathological behaviours (e.g., decreased mood symptoms of depression, anxiety and apathy and decreased behavior symptoms of hallucinations, delusions, agitation, irritability, and appetite disturbances), were found from meta‐analysis of the change scores from the NPI (7 weeks, 2.5 mg melatonin), and ADAS non‐cognitive (4 weeks, 3 mg melatonin) scales. Sensitivity analyses found similar results to those of the original meta‐analyses, and thus, supported the effect estimates for non‐significant cognitive outcomes. Individual study estimates for treatment effect of 2.5 mg melatonin at one year demonstrated a significant worsening of mood (e.g. decrease in positive affect) as measured by the Philadelphia Geriatric Centre Affect Rating Scale (positive). The remainder of the treatment effects for mood, behavior, and function of daily living were non‐significant. There were no reported adverse effects associated with melatonin use. Authors' conclusions The analyses did not support the use of melatonin for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with dementia. Meta‐analysis of psychopathologic behavior scale scores suggested that melatonin may be effective in treating these dementia‐related disturbances. Plain language summary Melatonin treatment may be effective for the treatment of dementia‐related behavior disturbances There are a number of studies that suggest a relationship between decline of melatonin function and the symptoms of dementia. Meta‐analysis was conducted on data from three randomised, placebo controlled trials that were designed to evaluate melatonin for managing dementia‐related cognitive changes; data also were pooled from two of these trials that evaluated melatonin for managing mood and behavioral disturbances. Significantly improved outcomes were found from the meta‐analysis of psychopathologic behavior and mood scale scores. Melatonin treatment may be effective for the treatment of dementia‐related psychopathologic behavior disturbances. No evidence was found to support the effectiveness of melatonin for the treatment of cognitive impairment.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve a satisfactory treatment response with ordinary antipsychotic drug treatment. In these cases, various add‐on medications are used, and valproate is one of these. Objectives To examine whether: 1. valproate alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychoses; and 2. valproate augmentation of antipsychotic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (July 2002; February 2007; July 2012; March 04, 2016). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of relevant studies in order to identify further trials. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing valproate to antipsychotics or to placebo (or no intervention), whether as the sole agent or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts, ordered papers, and re‐inspected and quality‐assessed these. At least two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results The 2012 update search identified 19 further relevant studies, most of which were from China. Thus the review currently includes 26 studies with a total of 2184 participants. All trials examined the effectiveness of valproate as an adjunct to antipsychotics. With the exception of two studies, the studies were small, the participants and personnel were not blinded (neither was outcome assessment), and most were short‐term and incompletely reported. For this update we prespecified seven main outcomes of interest: clinical response (clinically significant response, aggression/agitation), leaving the study early (acceptability of treatment, overall tolerability), adverse events (sedation, weight gain) and quality of life. Adding valproate to antipsychotic treatment resulted in more clinically significant response than adding placebo to antipsychotic drugs (14 RCTs, n = 1049, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.47, I 2  = 12%, low‐quality evidence). However, this effect was removed after excluding open RCTs in a sensitivity analysis. In terms of acceptability of treatment (measured by the number of participants leaving the study early due to any reason) valproate was just as acceptable as placebo (11 RCTs, n = 951, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.24, I 2  = 55%). Also overall tolerability (measured by the number of participants leaving the study early for adverse events) between valproate and placebo was similar (6 RCTs, n = 974, RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.97, I 2  = 0). Participants in the valproate group were found to be less aggressive than the control group based on the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (3 RCTs, n = 186, MD ‐2.55, 95% CI ‐3.92 to ‐1.19, I 2  = 82%, very low‐quality evidence). Participants receiving valproate more frequently experienced sedation (8 RCTs, n = 770, RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.79, I 2  = 0, low‐quality evidence) but were no more likely to gain weight than those receiving placebo (4 RCTs, n = 427, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.82, I 2  = 0, low‐quality evidence). No study reported on the important outcome of quality of life. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence, based on a number of trials, that the augmentation of antipsychotics with valproate may be effective for overall clinical response, and also for specific symptoms, especially in terms of excitement and aggression. However, this evidence was entirely based on open RCTs. Moreover, valproate was associated with a number of adverse events among which sedation and dizziness appeared significantly more frequently than in the control groups. Further randomised studies which are blinded are necessary before any clear recommendation can be made. Ideally these would focus on people with schizophrenia and aggression, on those with treatment‐resistant forms of the illness and on those with schizoaffective disorders. Plain language summary Valproate for schizophrenia Review question To review the effects of adding valproate to an anitpyschotic for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Background The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Despite this treatment, about 30% of people will continue to experience some signs of illness. Other drugs are sometimes added to antipsychotic medication to attempt to reduce the symptoms that people experience. Valproate is one such drug and is typically used to treat epilepsy, to stabilise mood in people who have bipolar disorder and for people who have both schizophrenia and mood disorder (schizoaffective disorder). Study characteristics The review includes 26 studies, found through electronic searching of relevant databases, with a total of 2184 participants. All trials examined the effectiveness of valproate as an add on to antipsychotics. With the exception of two studies, the studies were small, and most of them were short‐term and poorly reported. Key results Data from the included trials showed that participants receiving valproate plus an antipsychotic had better clinical response, compared to those taking an antipsychotic with a placebo. However, this advantage was lost when lower‐quality trials were taken out of the analysis. Valproate was also indicated to be effective in controlling excitement and aggression. Acceptability and overall tolerability of the combined treatment was similar between treatment groups and did not cause more weight gain, however, adding valproate did cause greater sedation and dizziness. No trial reported effect on quality of life. Quality of the evidence Evidence is limited and firm conclusions cannot be made. For the main outcomes of interest, the review authors judged the quality of evidence to be low or very low quality ,  due to methodological issues in the reviewed studies. Most of them were small, short‐term and did not blind the participants or personnel. Large, double‐blind and long‐term randomised trials should be undertaken to properly determine the clinical effects of adding valproate to antipsychotic treatment for people with schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background Therapist‐delivered trauma‐focused psychological therapies are an effective treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These have become the accepted first‐line treatments for the disorder. Despite the established evidence‐base for these therapies, they are not always widely available or accessible. Many barriers limit treatment uptake, such as the limited number of qualified therapists to deliver the interventions, cost, and compliance issues, such as time off work, childcare, and transportation, associated with the need to attend weekly appointments. Delivering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the Internet is an effective and acceptable alternative to therapist‐delivered treatments for anxiety and depression. However, fewer Internet‐based therapies have been developed and evaluated for PTSD, and uncertainty surrounds the efficacy of Internet‐based cognitive and behavioural therapy (I‐C/BT) for PTSD. Objectives To assess the effects of I‐C/BT for PTSD in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register (CCMDCTR) to June 2016 and identified four studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The CCMDCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) from MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched online clinical trial registries and reference lists of included studies, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional and ongoing studies. We ran an update search on 1 March 2018, and identified four additional completed studies, which we added to the analyses along with two that were previously awaiting classification. Selection criteria We searched for RCTs of I‐C/BT compared to face‐to‐face or Internet‐based psychological treatment, psychoeducation, wait list or care as usual. We included studies of adults (aged over 16 years or over), in which at least 70% of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Data collection and analysis We entered data into Review Manager 5 software. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data with a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, except where heterogeneity was present, in which case we used a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias; any conflicts were discussed with a third author, with the aim of reaching a unanimous decision. Main results We included 10 studies with 720 participants in the review. Eight of the studies compared I‐C/BT delivered with therapist guidance to a wait list control. Two studies compared guided I‐C/BT with I‐non‐C/BT. There was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. Very low‐quality evidence showed that, compared with wait list, I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in PTSD post‐treatment (SMD –0.60, 95% CI –0.97 to –0.24; studies = 8, participants = 560). However, there was no evidence of a difference in PTSD symptoms when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD –0.43, 95% CI –1.41 to 0.56; studies = 3, participants = 146). There may be little or no difference in dropout rates between the I‐C/BT and wait list groups (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.88; studies = 8, participants = 585; low‐quality evidence). I‐C/BT was no more effective than wait list at reducing the risk of a diagnosis of PTSD after treatment (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.00; studies = 1, participants = 62; very low‐quality evidence). I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in symptoms of depression both post‐treatment (SMD –0.61, 95% CI –1.17 to –0.05; studies = 5, participants = 425; very low‐quality evidence). Very low‐quality evidence also suggested that I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in symptoms of anxiety post‐treatment (SMD –0.67, 95% CI –0.98 to –0.36; studies = 4, participants = 305), and at follow‐up less than six months (MD –12.59, 95% CI –20.74 to –4.44; studies = 1, participants = 42; very low‐quality evidence). The effects of I‐C/BT on quality of life were uncertain (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12; studies = 2, participants = 221; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found no difference in PTSD symptoms between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups when measured post‐treatment (SMD –0.08, 95% CI –0.52 to 0.35; studies = 2, participants = 82; very low‐quality evidence), or when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI –0.41 to 0.57; studies = 2, participants = 65; very low‐quality evidence). However, those who received I‐C/BT reported their PTSD symptoms were better at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD –8.83, 95% CI –17.32 to –0.34; studies = 1, participants = 18; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found no difference in depressive symptoms between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups when measured post‐treatment (SMD –0.12, 95% CI –0.78 to 0.54; studies = 2, participants = 84; very low‐quality evidence) or when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD 0.20, 95% CI –0.31 to 0.71; studies = 2, participants = 61; very low‐quality evidence). However, those who received I‐C/BT reported their depressive symptoms were better at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD –8.34, 95% CI –15.83 to –0.85; studies = 1, participants = 18; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found no difference in symptoms of anxiety between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups when measured post‐treatment (SMD 0.08, 95% CI –0.78 to 0.95; studies = 2, participants = 74; very low‐quality evidence) or when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD –0.16, 95% CI –0.67 to 0.35; studies = 2, participants = 60; very low‐quality evidence). However, those who received I‐C/BT reported their symptoms of anxiety were better at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD –8.05, 95% CI –15.20 to –0.90; studies = 1, participants = 18; very low‐quality evidence). None of the included studies reported on cost‐effectiveness or adverse events. Authors' conclusions While the review found some beneficial effects of I‐C/BT for PTSD, the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of included trials. Further work is required to: establish non‐inferiority to current first‐line interventions, explore mechanisms of change, establish optimal levels of guidance, explore cost‐effectiveness, measure adverse events, and determine predictors of efficacy and dropout. Plain language summary Internet‐based cognitive and behavioural therapies for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Why was this review important? Post‐traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a common mental illness that can occur after a serious traumatic event. Symptoms include re‐experiencing the trauma as nightmares, flashbacks, and distressing thoughts; avoiding reminders of the traumatic event; experiencing negative changes to thoughts and mood; and hyperarousal, which includes feeling on edge, being easily startled, feeling angry, having difficulties sleeping, and problems concentrating. PTSD can be treated effectively with talking therapies that focus on the trauma. Some of the most effective therapies are those based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Unfortunately, there are a limited number of qualified therapists who are able to deliver these therapies. There are also other factors that limit access to treatment, such as taking time off work to attend appointments, and transportation issues. An alternative is to deliver psychological therapy on the Internet, with or without guidance from a therapist. Internet‐based cognitive and behavioural therapies (I‐C/BT) have received a great deal of attention, and are now used routinely to treat depression and anxiety. There have been fewer studies of I‐C/BT for PTSD, and we do not yet know whether they are effective. Who will be interested in this review? • People with PTSD and their loved ones. • Professionals working in mental health services. • General practitioners. • Commissioners. What questions did this review try to answer? In adults with PTSD, we tried to find out if I‐C/BT: • was more effective than no therapy (waiting list); • was as effective as psychological therapies delivered by a therapist; • was more effective than other psychological therapies delivered online; or • was more effective than education about the condition delivered online, at reducing symptoms of PTSD, and improving quality of life; or • was cost effective, compared to face‐to‐face therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that examined I‐C/BT for adults with PTSD, published between 1970 and 2 March 2018. We included 10 studies with 720 participants.  What did the evidence from the review tell us? • Very low‐quality evidence from eight studies found that I‐C/BT was more effective than no therapy (waiting list) at reducing symptoms of PTSD. • Very low‐quality evidence from two studies found no significant difference between I‐C/BT and another type of psychological therapy delivered online. • We found no studies that compared I‐C/BT to psychological therapy delivered by a therapist, or education about the condition delivered online. • We found no evidence to tell us whether people who received I‐C/BT felt it was an acceptable treatment, or whether it was effective in improving quality of life. • We found no studies that reported on the cost effectiveness of I‐C/BT. What should happen next? The current evidence base is small. More studies are needed to decide if I‐C/BT should be used routinely for the treatment of PTSD.

AB: Abstract - Background Suicide is a leading cause of death among post‐secondary students worldwide. Suicidal thoughts and planning are common among post‐secondary students. Previous reviews have examined the effectiveness of interventions for symptomatic individuals; however, many students at high risk of suicide are undiagnosed and untreated. Objectives We evaluated the effect on suicide and suicide‐related outcomes of primary suicide prevention interventions that targeted students within the post‐secondary setting. Search methods We searched the following sources up to June 2011: Specialised Registers of two Cochrane Groups, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and nine other databases, trial registers, conference proceedings, and websites of national and international organizations. We screened reference lists and contacted authors of included studies to identify additional studies. We updated the search in November 2013; we will include these results in the review's next update. Selection criteria We included studies that tested an intervention for the primary prevention of suicide using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), controlled before‐and‐after (CBA), controlled interrupted time series (CITS), or interrupted time series (ITS) study design. Interventions targeted students within the post‐secondary setting (i.e. college, university, academy, vocational, or any other post‐secondary educational institution) without known mental illness, previous suicide attempt or self‐harm, or suicidal ideation. Outcomes included suicides, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, changes in suicide‐related knowledge, attitudes and behavior, and availability of means of suicide. Data collection and analysis We used standardized electronic forms for data extraction, risk of bias and quality of evidence determination, and analysis. We estimated standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed studies by intervention type and study design. We summarized RCT effect sizes using random‐effects models meta‐analyses; and analysed statistical heterogeneity using the Chi 2  test and I 2  statistic. We described narratively the results from studies that used other study designs. Main results Eight studies met inclusion criteria. They were heterogeneous in terms of participants, study designs, and interventions. Five of eight studies had high risk of bias. In 3 RCTs (312 participants), classroom‐based didactic and experiential programs increased short‐term knowledge of suicide (SMD = 1.51, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.45;  moderate quality evidence ) and knowledge of suicide prevention (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07;  moderate quality evidence ). The effect on suicide prevention self‐efficacy in one RCT (152 participants) was uncertain (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.54;  low quality evidence ). One CBA analysed the effects of an institutional policy that restricted student access to laboratory cyanide and mandated professional assessment for suicidal students. The incidence of student suicide decreased significantly at one university with the policy relative to 11 control universities, 2.00 vs. 8.68 per 100,000 (Z = 5.90; P < 0.05). Four CBAs explored effects of training 'gatekeepers' to recognize and respond to warning signs of emotional crises and suicide risk in students they encountered. The magnitude of effect sizes varied between studies. Gatekeeper training enhanced short‐term suicide knowledge in students, peer advisors residing in student accommodation, and faculty and staff, and suicide prevention self‐efficacy among peer advisors. There was no evidence of an effect on participants' suicide‐related attitudes or behaviors. One CBA found no evidence of effects of gatekeeper training of peer advisors on suicide‐related knowledge, self‐efficacy, or gatekeeper behaviors measured four to six months after intervention. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to support widespread implementation of any programs or policies for primary suicide prevention in post‐secondary educational settings. As all evaluated interventions combined primary and secondary prevention components, we were unable to determine the independent effects of primary preventive interventions. Classroom instruction and gatekeeper training increased short‐term suicide‐related knowledge. We found no studies that tested the effects of classroom instruction on suicidal behavior or long‐term outcomes. Limited evidence suggested minimal longer‐term effects of gatekeeper training on suicide‐related knowledge, while no evidence was found evaluating its effect on suicidal behavior. A policy‐based suicide intervention reduced student suicide, but findings have not been replicated. Our findings are limited by the overall low quality of the evidence and the lack of studies from middle‐ and low‐income countries. Rigorously designed studies should test the effects of preventive interventions on important health outcomes, including suicidal ideation and behavior, in varying post‐secondary settings. Plain language summary Prevention of suicide in university and other post‐secondary educational settings Review question We reviewed evidence about the effect of suicide prevention programs on post‐secondary students who are not known to be suicidal. We examined the effects of these programs on suicide, suicidal behavior, and knowledge and attitudes about suicide. Background Worldwide, suicide is a leading cause of death among post‐secondary students. Suicidal thoughts and planning are common among such students. However, fewer than half of students who report suicidal thoughts or other serious mental illness have received professional treatment. There is a need for suicide prevention programs that target students who are not already known to be suicidal ("primary prevention"). Study characteristics We identified eight studies that were eligible for this Cochrane Review. All studies had both primary and secondary prevention components. That is, they targeted students known to be suicidal as well as those not known to be suicidal. We separately analysed the effects of classroom instruction, institutional policies, and gatekeeper training programs. Gatekeeper training programs train people to recognize and respond to warning signs of emotional crises or suicide risk in students they encounter. The evidence is current to June 2011. Key results Three studies, including 312 students, evaluated classroom instruction. Classroom instruction increases short‐term knowledge of suicide and suicide prevention. It may slightly enhance short‐term confidence in ability to prevent suicide. However, long‐term effects have not been studied. Effects of classroom instruction on suicidal behavior have also not been studied. One study evaluated an institutional policy. The policy restricted access to laboratory cyanide and required professional assessment for students who threatened or attempted suicide. The policy significantly reduced student suicides. These findings have not been tested in other post‐secondary institutions. Four studies, ranging from 53 to 146 participants, evaluated the effect of gatekeeper training programs. Gatekeeper training may lead to small‐to‐medium improvements in short‐term suicide‐related knowledge and confidence about being able to prevent suicide. We found no evidence that gatekeeper training improved short‐term attitudes toward suicide or long‐term knowledge or behaviors about suicide. The effect of gatekeeper training on suicide or suicidal behavior has not been evaluated. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence for short‐term knowledge of suicide and suicide prevention was moderate. For suicide prevention self‐efficacy, the quality of evidence was low. The quality of evidence was reduced because results were not similar across studies and there were not enough data.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia can be a severe and chronic illness characterised by lack of insight and poor compliance with treatment. Psychoeducational approaches have been developed to increase patients' knowledge of, and insight into, their illness and its treatment. It is supposed that this increased knowledge and insight will enable people with schizophrenia to cope in a more effective way with their illness, thereby improving prognosis. Objectives To assess the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard levels of knowledge provision. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010). We updated this search November 2012 and added 27 new trials to the awaiting assessment section. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on psychoeducation for schizophrenia and/or related serious mental illnesses involving individuals or groups. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors extracted data independently from included papers. We contacted authors of trials for additional and missing data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data. We used a fixed‐effects model for heterogeneous dichotomous data. Where possible we also calculated the numbers needed to treat (NNT), as well as weighted means for continuous data. Main results This review includes a total of 5142 participants (mostly inpatients) from 44 trials conducted between 1988 and 2009 (median study duration ˜ 12 weeks, risk of bias ‐ moderate). We found that incidences of non‐compliance were lower in the psychoeducation group in the short term (n = 1400, RR 0.52 CI 0.40 to 0.67, NNT 11 CI 9 to 16). This finding holds for the medium and long term. Relapse appeared to be lower in psychoeducation group (n = 1214, RR 0.70 CI 0.61 to 0.81, NNT 9 CI 7 to 14) and this also applied to readmission (n = 206, RR 0.71 CI 0.56 to 0.89, NNT 5 CI 4 to 13). Scale‐derived data also suggested that psychoeducation promotes better social and global functioning. In the medium term, treating four people with schizophrenia with psychoeducation instead of standard care resulted in one additional person showing a clinical improvement. Evidence suggests that participants receiving psychoeducation are more likely to be satisfied with mental health services (n = 236, RR 0.24 CI 0.12 to 0.50, NNT 5 CI 5 to 8) and have improved quality of life. Authors' conclusions Psychoeducation does seem to reduce relapse, readmission and encourage medication compliance, as well as reduce the length of hospital stay in these hospital‐based studies of limited quality. The true size of effect is likely to be less than demonstrated in this review ‐ but, nevertheless, some sort of psychoeducation could be clinically effective and potentially cost beneficial. It is not difficult to justify better, more applicable, research in this area aimed at fully investigating the effects of this promising approach. Note: the 27 new citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Psychoeducation added to standard treatment for schizophrenia reduces relapse The purpose of patient education/teaching (or psychoeducation) is to increase patients' knowledge and understanding of their illness and treatment. It is supposed that increased knowledge enables people with schizophrenia to cope more effectively with their illness. Psychoeducational interventions involve interaction between the information provider and the mentally ill person. This review compares the efficacy of psychoeducation added to standard care as a means of helping severely mentally ill people with that of standard care alone. The evidence shows a significant reduction of relapse or readmission rates. There seems to be some suggestion that psychoeducation may improve compliance with medication, but the extent of improvement remains unclear. The findings show a possibility that psychoeducation has a positive effect on a person's well being and promotes better social function. In the medium term, treating four people with schizophrenia with psychoeducation instead of standard care resulted in one additional person showing a clinical improvement. The scarcity of studies made the comparison between the efficacy of different formats (programmes of 10 sessions or less or 11 or more, individual or group sessions) weak.

AB: Abstract - Background Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent condition, characterised by excessive worry or anxiety about everyday events and problems. The effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of psychological therapies as a group has not yet been evaluated in the treatment of GAD. Objectives To examine the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies, categorised as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive therapy, compared with treatment as usual/waiting list (TAU/WL) and compared with one another, for patients with GAD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register and conducted supplementary searches of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, LILACS and controlledtrials.com in February 2006. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials conducted in non‐inpatient settings, involving adults aged 18‐75 years with a primary diagnosis of GAD, assigned to a psychological therapy condition compared with TAU/WL or another psychological therapy. Data collection and analysis Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed. The primary outcome was anxiety reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta‐analyses. Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post‐treatment (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.74), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer‐term assessments of CBT against TAU/WL. Six studies compared CBT against supportive therapy (non‐directive therapy and attention‐placebo conditions). No significant difference in clinical response was indicated between CBT and supportive therapy at post‐treatment (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.06), however, significant heterogeneity was indicated, which was partly explained by the number of therapy sessions. Authors' conclusions Psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short‐term treatment of GAD. The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective. Further studies examining non‐CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for people with generalised anxiety disorder Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a very common condition, in which people suffer from excessive worry or anxiety about everyday events and problems. Psychological therapies are a popular form of treatment for anxiety disorders. This review aimed to find out whether psychological therapies are effective for GAD, and whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is more effective than other psychological therapy approaches, including psychodynamic and supportive therapies. The review included 25 studies, with a total of 1305 participants. All the studies used a CBT approach, and compared CBT against treatment as usual or waiting list (13 studies), or against another psychological therapy (12 studies). The review showed that people attending for psychological therapy based on a CBT approach were more likely to have reduced anxiety at the end of treatment than people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for therapy. CBT was also very effective in reducing secondary symptoms of worry and depression. People who attended for group CBT and older people were more likely to drop out of therapy. None of the studies comparing CBT with treatment as usual or waiting list looked at the long‐term effectiveness of CBT. It is not clear whether people attending for CBT sessions were more likely to have reduced anxiety than people attending for psychodynamic therapy or supportive therapy, because only one study compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, and the six studies that compared CBT with supportive therapy showed differing results. None of the studies included in the review reported on the possible side effects or acceptability of psychological therapies. More studies should be carried out to establish whether psychodynamic and supportive therapies are effective for GAD, and whether CBT is more helpful than other psychological therapy approaches in treating GAD.

AB: Abstract - Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a common, debilitating and serious health problem. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may help to alleviate the symptoms of CFS. Objectives To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of CBT for CFS, alone and in combination with other interventions, compared with usual care and other interventions. Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 28/3/2008. We conducted supplementary searches of other bibliographic databases. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, assigned to a CBT condition compared with usual care or another intervention, alone or in combination. Data collection and analysis Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and risk of bias was assessed for each study. The primary outcome was reduction in fatigue severity, based on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), or a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post‐treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT (SMD ‐0.39, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.19), with 40% of CBT participants (four studies, 371 participants) showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76). Findings at follow‐up were inconsistent. For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post‐treatment favoured CBT (SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.65 to ‐0.20). Findings at follow‐up were heterogeneous and inconsistent. Only two studies compared CBT against other interventions and one study compared CBT in combination with other interventions against usual care. Authors' conclusions CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue at post‐treatment compared with usual care, and may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared with other psychological therapies. The evidence base at follow‐up is limited to a small group of studies with inconsistent findings. There is a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments, and further studies are required to inform the development of effective treatment programmes for people with CFS. Plain language summary Cognitive behaviour therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a very common and disabling condition, in which people suffer from persistent symptoms of fatigue that are unexplained. Cognitive behaviour therapy is a psychological therapy model that is commonly used to treat a range of psychological and chronic pain conditions. This review aimed to find out whether CBT is effective for CBT, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with other treatments, and whether it is more effective than other treatments used for CFS. The review included 15 studies, with a total of 1043 CFS participants. The review showed that people attending for CBT were more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than people who received usual care or were on a waiting list for therapy, with 40% of people in the CBT group showing clinical improvement, in contrast with 26% in usual care. At follow‐up, 1‐7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. Physical functioning, depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms were also more reduced when compared with other psychological therapies. However at follow‐up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Very few studies reported on the acceptability of CBT and no studies examined side effects. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches.

AB: Abstract - Background Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non‐affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re‐inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed‐effect model. Main results We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow‐up (n=512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n=1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early ( n=1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n=1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n=942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n=1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n=1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n=165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43). Authors' conclusions The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well‐established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence‐based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia For previous plain language summary please see  Appendix 3 . People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, being an older drug (‘typical’ or first generation) it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in treating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (‘dummy’ treatment or placebo). Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality. There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people’s mental health, symptoms and functioning. However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating. Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation. It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness. Chlorpromazine is low‐cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods. Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents.

AB: Abstract - Background It is controversial whether compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental illness (SMI) reduces health service use, or improves clinical outcome and social functioning. Objectives To examine the effectiveness of compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental illness (SMI). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (2003, 2008, 2012, 8 November 2013, 3 June 2016). We obtained all references of identified studies and contacted authors where necessary. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of CCT compared with standard care for people with SMI (mainly schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like disorders, bipolar disorder, or depression with psychotic features). Standard care could be voluntary treatment in the community or another pre‐existing form of CCT such as supervised discharge. Data collection and analysis Authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality and extracted data. We used Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. For binary outcomes, we calculated a fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and, where possible, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a fixed‐effect mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI. We used the GRADE approach to create 'Summary of findings' tables for key outcomes and assessed the risk of bias of these findings. Main results The review included three studies (n = 749). Two were based in the USA and one in England. The English study had the least bias, meeting three out of the seven criteria of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. The two other studies met only one criterion, the majority being rated unclear. Two trials from the USA (n = 416) compared court‐ordered 'outpatient commitment' (OPC) with entirely voluntary community treatment. There were no significant differences between OPC and voluntary treatment by 11 to 12 months in any of the main health service or participant level outcome indices: service use ‐ readmission to hospital (2 RCTs, n= 416, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.21, low‐quality evidence); service use ‐ compliance with medication (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19, low‐quality evidence); social functioning ‐ arrested at least once (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.52, low‐quality evidence); social functioning ‐ homelessness (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.15, low‐quality evidence); or satisfaction with care ‐ perceived coercion (2 RCTs, n = 416, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.89, low‐quality evidence). However, one trial found the risk of victimisation decreased with OPC (1 RCT, n = 264, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.80, low‐quality evidence). The other RCT compared community treatment orders (CTOs) with less intensive and briefer supervised discharge (Section 17) in England. The study found no difference between the two groups for either the main health service outcomes including readmission to hospital by 12 months (1 RCT, n = 333, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.32, moderate‐quality evidence), or any of the participant level outcomes. The lack of any difference between the two groups persisted at 36 months' follow‐up. Combining the results of all three trials did not alter these results. For instance, participants on any form of CCT were no less likely to be readmitted than participants in the control groups whether on entirely voluntary treatment or subject to intermittent supervised discharge (3 RCTs, n = 749, RR for readmission to hospital by 12 months 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16 moderate‐quality evidence). In terms of NNTB, it would take 142 orders to prevent one readmission. There was no clear difference between groups for perceived coercion by 12 months (3 RCTs, n = 645, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.71, moderate‐quality evidence). There were no data for adverse effects. Authors' conclusions These review data show CCT results in no clear difference in service use, social functioning or quality of life compared with voluntary care or brief supervised discharge. People receiving CCT were, however, less likely to be victims of violent or non‐violent crime. It is unclear whether this benefit is due to the intensity of treatment or its compulsory nature. Short periods of conditional leave may be as effective (or non‐effective) as formal compulsory treatment in the community. Evaluation of a wide range of outcomes should be considered when this legislation is introduced. However, conclusions are based on three relatively small trials, with high or unclear risk of blinding bias, and low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence. In addition, clinical trials may not fully reflect the potential benefits of this complex intervention. Plain language summary Compulsory community and involuntary outpatient treatment for people with severe mental disorders Background Many countries use compulsory community treatment (CCT) for people with severe mental health problems, including Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. Supporters of this approach suggest that CCT is necessary due to the shift to community care of people with severe mental illness and that it is less restrictive to compulsorily treat someone in the community than to subject them to repeated hospital admissions. They also argue that it is effective in bringing stability to the lives of people with severe mental illness. Opponents of CCT fear treatment and support will be replaced by a greater emphasis on control, restraint and threat. There is also a fear that CCT may undermine the relationship between healthcare professionals and patients, leading to feelings of mistrust and being controlled, which may drive people with severe mental illnesses away from care services. Given the widespread use of such powers, which compel people to follow‐up with mental health services and undergo treatment while living in the community, it is important to assess the benefits, effectiveness or possible hazards of compulsory treatment. Searches This review is based on searches run in 2012 and 2013, and updated in 2016. Study characteristics This review now includes three trials with 749 people, with follow‐up in one study extending to 36 months. Two of these trials compared forms of CCT versus standard care or voluntary care and the third trial compared a form of CCT called 'community treatment order' to supervised discharge. Results Results from the trials showed overall CCT was no more likely to result in better service use, social functioning, mental state or quality of life compared with standard 'voluntary' care. People in the trial receiving CCT were less likely to be victims of violent or non‐violent crime. Short periods of conditional leave may be as effective (or non‐effective) as compulsory treatment in the community. Conclusions There was very limited information available, all results were based on three relatively small trials of low to medium quality, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions, so further research into the effects of different types of CCT is much needed.

AB: Abstract - Background A particularly difficult challenge for community treatment of people with serious mental illnesses is the delivery of an acceptable level of care during the acute phases of severe mental illness. Crisis‐intervention models of care were developed as a possible solution. Objectives To review the effects of crisis‐intervention models for anyone with serious mental illness experiencing an acute episode compared to the standard care they would normally receive. If possible, to compare the effects of mobile crisis teams visiting patients' homes with crisis units based in home‐like residential houses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials. There is no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. This search was undertaken in 1998 and then updated 2003, 2006, 2010 and September 29, 2014. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials of crisis‐intervention models versus standard care for people with severe mental illnesses that met our inclusion criteria. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results The update search September 2014 found no further new studies for inclusion, the number of studies included in this review remains eight with a total of 1144 participants. Our main outcomes of interest are hospital use, global state, mental state, quality of life, participant satisfaction and family burden. With the exception of mental state, it was not possible to pool data for these outcomes. Crisis intervention may reduce repeat admissions to hospital (excluding index admissions) at six months (1 RCT, n = 369, RR 0.75 CI 0.50 to 1.13,  high quality evidence ), but does appear to reduce family burden (at six months: 1 RCT, n = 120, RR 0.34 CI 0.20 to 0.59,  low quality evidence ), improve mental state (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) three months: 2 RCTs, n = 248, MD ‐4.03 CI ‐8.18 to 0.12,  low quality evidence ), and improve global state (Global Assessment Scale (GAS) 20 months; 1 RCT, n = 142, MD 5.70, ‐0.26 to 11.66,  moderate quality evidence ). Participants in the crisis‐intervention group were more satisfied with their care 20 months after crisis (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‐8): 1 RCT, n = 137, MD 5.40 CI 3.91 to 6.89,  moderate quality evidence ). However, quality of life scores at six months were similar between treatment groups (Manchester Short Assessment of quality of life (MANSA); 1 RCT, n = 226, MD ‐1.50 CI ‐5.15 to 2.15,  low quality evidence ). Favourable results for crisis intervention were also found for leaving the study early and family satisfaction. No differences in death rates were found. Some studies suggested crisis intervention to be more cost‐effective than hospital care but all numerical data were either skewed or unusable. We identified no data on staff satisfaction, carer input, complications with medication or number of relapses. Authors' conclusions Care based on crisis‐intervention principles, with or without an ongoing homecare package, appears to be a viable and acceptable way of treating people with serious mental illnesses. However only eight small studies with unclear blinding, reporting and attrition bias could be included and evidence for the main outcomes of interest is low to moderate quality. If this approach is to be widely implemented it would seem that more evaluative studies are still needed. Plain language summary Crisis intervention for people with severe mental illnesses The move from hospital to community‐based care can be a frightening and difficult experience for people with severe mental illness (SMI). People with mental health problems may not have networks of support such as family, friends and carers. They often have no one they know personally to help them when they go home. To complicate matters, people with SMI can have critical downturns in their mental health creating a revolving‐door of care, where service users are discharged from hospital when considered stable and well, only to go back into hospital again when their mental health becomes worse during an acute episode or crisis. Crisis‐intervention and homecare packages have been developed as a possible solution to these problems. Crisis care, where support is provided during a crisis for service users, either in their home or a community setting, was found by this review to provide a package of support that was worthwhile, acceptable and less expensive than standard care. Furthermore, crisis care avoided repeat admission to hospital; improved the mental state of services users more than standard care; was more acceptable and satisfactory to service users and placed less burden on families and carers. There were no differences in death rates between crisis intervention and standard care. The review, however, looks at only eight studies. The methods of most of these studies were considered poor and there was no definitive description of crisis intervention or crisis care for studies included before 2006, meaning there was a lack of focus on crisis care in its pure form. Most studies excluded service users with alcohol or drug misuse, and those who were a danger of being harmful to themselves or others. The authors of the review suggest more studies are needed to create a stronger evidence base. Crisis care may be currently delivered without sound and good quality evidence. For example, no data or information were available on carer input, concordance or the willingness of service users to take medication and the number of relapses experienced by service users. Finally, despite reports of staff 'burn‐out', staff satisfaction with crisis care was not assessed.

AB: Abstract - Background Those with serious/severe mental illness, especially schizophrenia and schizophrenic‐like disorders, often have little to no insight regarding the presence of their illness. Psychoeducation may be defined as the education of a person with a psychiatric disorder regarding the symptoms, treatments, and prognosis of that illness. Brief psychoeducation is a short period of psychoeducation; although what constitutes 'brief psychoeducation' can vary. A previous systematic review has shown that the median length of psychoeducation is around 12 weeks. In this current systematic review, we defined 'brief psychoeducation' as programmes of 10 sessions or less. Objectives To assess the efficacy of brief psychoeducational interventions as a means of helping severely mentally ill people when added to 'standard' care, compared with the efficacy of standard care alone. The secondary objective is to investigate whether there is evidence that a particular kind (individual/ family/group) of brief psychoeducational intervention is superior to others. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group register September 2013 using the phrase: [*Psychoeducat* in interventions of STUDY]. Reference lists of included studies were also inspected for further relevant studies. We also contacted authors of included study for further information regarding further data or details of any unpublished trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing brief psychoeducation with any other intervention for treatment of people with severe mental illness. If a trial was described as 'double blind' but implied randomisation, we entered such trials in a sensitivity analysis. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors extracted data independently from included papers. We contacted authors of trials for additional and missing data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data. For continuous data, we calculated the mean difference (MD), again with 95% CIs. We used a fixed‐effect model for data synthesis, and also assessed data using a random‐effects model in a sensitivity analysis. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results We included twenty studies with a total number of 2337 participants in this review. Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation with routine care or conventional delivery of information. One study compared brief psychoeducation with cognitive behavior therapy. Participants receiving brief psychoeducation were less likely to be non‐compliant with medication than those receiving routine care in the short term (n = 448, 3 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.41 to 0.96,  moderate quality evidence ) and medium term (n = 118, 1 RCT, RR 0.17 CI 0.05 to 0.54,  low quality evidence ). Compliance with follow‐up was similar between the two groups in the short term (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.24 to 4.18), medium term (n = 322, 4 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.50 to 1.09) and long term (n = 386, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19, CI 0.83 to 1.72). Relapse rates were significantly lower amongst participants receiving brief psychoeducation than those receiving routine care in the medium term (n = 406, RR 0.70 CI 0.52 to 0.93,  moderate quality evidence ), but not in the long term. Data from a few individual studies supported that brief psychoeducation: i) can improve the long‐term global state (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD ‐6.70 CI ‐13.38 to ‐0.02,  very low quality evidence ); ii) promote improved mental state in short term (n = 60, 1 RCT, MD ‐2.70 CI ‐4.84 to ‐0.56, low quality evidence ) and medium term; iii) can lower the incidence and severity of anxiety and depression. Social function such as rehabilitation status (n = 118, 1 RCT, MD ‐13.68 CI ‐14.85 to ‐12.51,  low quality evidence ) and social disability (n = 118, 1 RCT, MD ‐1.96 CI ‐2.09 to ‐1.83,  low quality evidence ) were also improved in the brief psychoeducation group. There was no difference found in quality of life as measured by GQOLI‐74 in the short term (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD 0.63 CI ‐0.79 to 2.05,  low quality evidence ), nor the death rate in either groups (n = 154, 2 RCTs, RR 0.99, CI 0.15 to 6.65,  low quality evidence) . Authors' conclusions Based on mainly low to very low quality evidence from a limited number of studies, brief psychoeducation of any form appears to reduce relapse in the medium term, and promote medication compliance in the short term. A brief psychoeducational approach could potentially be effective, but further large, high‐quality studies are needed to either confirm or refute the use of this approach. Plain language summary The effectiveness of brief psychoeducation (10 sessions or less) for people with serious mental illness Review question . To investigate the effectiveness of brief psychoeducation compared with standard care as a means of helping people with serious mental illness. To investigate whether any kind (individual/ family/group) of brief psychoeducation is better than others. Background. Schizophrenia is a serious, long‐term mental illness where people experience hallucinations and/or delusions and are often unable to distinguish these experiences from reality. Hearing voices and seeing things can be disturbing, confusing and frightening and can lead to changes in behaviour. It is suggested that insight into the illness can help people to understand the need for treatment and subsequently improve the prognosis. However, the nature of schizophrenia is such that it alters peoples thought processes and they are often unable to have insight into their illness. The stigma of having a mental illness can also influence a person's willingness to seek or take treatments. Effective education of people with schizophrenia can improve insight and understanding. Psychoeducation programmes have been developed, specifically aimed at people with mental health problems. It is not simply providing information to patients. Rather, it is a form of empowering training targeted at promoting awareness and providing tools to manage, cope and live with a mental illness. However, psychoeducation can be time consuming; brief psychoeducation has been developed as a possible solution to this problem. In this review the authors defined brief psychoeducation to be a psychoeducation programme of 10 sessions or less. Study characteristics . The review authors searched for randomised trials in 2013 and found 20 relevant studies with 2337 participants. Half of the studies were carried out in China. These trials randomised people to receive either brief psychoeducation sessions (these ranged from one‐day psychoeducation to eight sessions of psychoeducation over a period of one year) or routine care. Key results. Based on information from a limited number of studies, brief psychoeducation does seem to reduce relapse and encourage people to take their medication. Those receiving brief psychoeducation also have more favourable results for mental state and social functioning. Quality of the evidence. Although initial results are encouraging, most information and data for the main outcomes of interest, were rated as low or very low quality, and the number of trials providing useful data is small. Until further large, high‐quality studies become available, the usefulness of brief psychoeducation remains debatable. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation. http://mcpin.org/

AB: Abstract - Background Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic drug from the phenothiazine group of antipsychotics. It has been commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia, however, with the advent of atypical antipsychotic medications, use has declined over the years. Objectives To measure the outcomes (both beneficial and harmful) of the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of oral fluphenazine versus atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Studies (25 April 2013). For the economic search, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on 31 January 2014 Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluphenazine (oral) with any other oral atypical antipsychotics. Data collection and analysis Review authors worked independently to inspect citations and assess the quality of the studies and to extract data. For homogeneous dichotomous data we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and calculated the mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results Four studies randomising a total of 202 people with schizophrenia are included. Oral fluphenazine was compared with oral amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine. Comparing oral fluphenazine with amisulpride, there was no difference between groups for mental state using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (1 RCT, n = 57, MD 5.10 95% CI ‐2.35 to 12.55,  very low‐quality evidence ), nor was there any difference in numbers leaving the study early for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 98, RR 1.19 95% CI 0.63 to 2.28,  very low‐quality evidence ). More people required concomitant anticholinergic medication in the fluphenazine group compared to amisulpride (1 RCT, n = 36, RR 7.82 95% CI 1.07 to 57.26,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for important outcomes including relapse, changes in life skills, quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. Comparing oral fluphenazine with risperidone, data showed no difference between groups for 'clinically important response' (1 RCT, n = 26, RR 0.67 95% CI 0.13 to 3.35,  very low‐quality evidence ) nor leaving the study early due to inefficacy (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 1.08 95% CI 0.08 to 15.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported data for relapse; change in life skills; quality of life; extrapyramidal adverse effects; or cost‐effectiveness. Once again there was no difference when oral fluphenazine was compared with quetiapine for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 0.62 95% CI 0.12 to 3.07,  very low‐quality evidence ), nor leaving the study early for any reason (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 0.46 95% CI 0.05 to 4.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for relapse; clinically important change in life skills; quality of life; extrapyramidal adverse effects; or cost‐effectiveness. Compared to olanzapine, fluphenazine showed no superiority for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.86 to 2.07,  very low‐quality evidence ), in incidence of akathisia (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.90 to 10.01,  very low‐quality evidence ) or in people leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.33 to 27.23,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for relapse; change in life skills; quality of life; or cost‐effectiveness. Authors' conclusions Measures of clinical response and mental state do not highlight differences between fluphenazine and amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Largely measures of adverse effects are also unconvincing for substantive differences between fluphenazine and the newer drugs. All included trials carry a substantial risk of bias regarding reporting of adverse effects and this bias would have favoured the newer drugs. The four small short included studies do not provide much clear information about the relative merits  or disadvantages  of oral fluphenazine compared with newer atypical antipsychotics. Plain language summary Comparing effectiveness of an older antipsychotic (oral fluphenazine) with newer antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia Introduction   People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). It is a distressing and debilitating illness. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic drug first formulated in the 1950s, effective for treating the psychoses of schizophrenia. However fluphenazine can cause some serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, and is known to lower people’s mood. Fluphenazine is inexpensive but the arrival of newer antipsychotic drugs with fewer movement disorder side effects reduced its use and market share. Methods   An electronic search of Cochrane Schizophrenia's register of studies was carried out in 2013. Review authors looked for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either oral fluphenazine or an atypical antipsychotic. Four studies with a total of 202 people with schizophrenia could be included. The trials compared fluphenazine with either amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Results   Data showed oral fluphenazine is no better or worse in improving mental state than amisulpride but more people receiving oral fluphenazine did need to take additional anticholinergic medication (drugs used to help relieve a range of symptoms such as involuntary movements of the muscles, high blood pressure and insomnia). Data from the trials comparing oral fluphenazine with either risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine also showed no superiority between the treatment groups for clinical improvement. Only the trial comparing oral fluphenazine with olanzapine provided adverse‐effects data. Again, incidence of akathisia, a movement disorder, was similar between treatment groups. Quality of evidence   Evidence from these few trials is poor, of low quality and involves a small number of participants. It does not provide clear overall information about whether oral fluphenazine is better or worse than atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Data were not available for important outcomes such as such, relapse, hospital admission, satisfaction, costs and quality of life. Adverse‐effects data were poorly reported. Future large‐scale research should report on these important outcomes. Conclusions   Fluphenazine is low cost and widely available, so is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. However, evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials about its effectiveness compared to atypical antipsychotics is unclear.

AB: Abstract - Background The prevention of long‐term psychological distress following traumatic events is a major concern. Systematic reviews have suggested that individual psychological debriefing is not an effective intervention at preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the past 20 years, other forms of intervention have been developed with the aim of preventing PTSD. Objectives To examine the efficacy of psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals exposed to a traumatic event but not identified as experiencing any specific psychological difficulties, in comparison with control conditions (e.g. usual care, waiting list and no treatment) and other psychological interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and ProQuest's Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database to 3 March 2018. An earlier search of CENTRAL and the Ovid databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to May 2016). We handsearched reference lists of relevant guidelines, systematic reviews and included study reports. Identified studies were shared with key experts in the field. We conducted an update search (15 March 2019) and placed any new trials in the 'awaiting classification' section. These will be incorporated into the next version of this review, as appropriate. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials of any multiple session (two or more sessions) early psychological intervention or treatment designed to prevent symptoms of PTSD. We excluded single session individual/group psychological interventions. Comparator interventions included waiting list/usual care and active control condition. We included studies of adults who experienced a traumatic event which met the criterion A1 according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐IV) for PTSD. Data collection and analysis We entered data into Review Manager 5 software. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data with a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, except where there was heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias and discussed any conflicts with a third review author. Main results This is an update of a previous review. We included 27 studies with 3963 participants. The meta‐analysis included 21 studies of 2721 participants. Seventeen studies compared multiple session early psychological intervention versus treatment as usual and four studies compared a multiple session early psychological intervention with active control condition. Low‐certainty evidence indicated that multiple session early psychological interventions may be more effective than usual care in reducing PTSD diagnosis at three to six months' follow‐up (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93; I 2  = 34%; studies = 5; participants = 758). However, there was no statistically significant difference post‐treatment (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; I 2  = 0%; studies = 5; participants = 556; very low‐certainty evidence) or at seven to 12 months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.49; studies = 1; participants = 132; very low‐certainty evidence). Meta‐analysis indicated that there was no statistical difference in dropouts compared with usual care (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.95; I 2  = 34%; studies = 11; participants = 1154; low‐certainty evidence) .At the primary endpoint of three to six months, low‐certainty evidence indicated no statistical difference between groups in reducing severity of PTSD (SMD –0.10, 95% CI –0.22 to 0.02; I 2  = 34%; studies = 15; participants = 1921), depression (SMD –0.04, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.10; I 2  = 6%; studies = 7; participants = 1009) or anxiety symptoms (SMD –0.05, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.10; I 2  = 2%; studies = 6; participants = 945). No studies comparing an intervention and active control reported outcomes for PTSD diagnosis. Low‐certainty evidence showed that interventions may be associated with a higher dropout rate than active control condition (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.34; studies = 2; participants = 425). At three to six months, low‐certainty evidence indicated no statistical difference between interventions in terms of severity of PTSD symptoms (SMD –0.02, 95% CI –0.31 to 0.26; I 2  = 43%; studies = 4; participants = 465), depression (SMD 0.04, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.23; I 2  = 0%; studies = 2; participants = 409), anxiety (SMD 0.00, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.19; I 2  = 0%; studies = 2; participants = 414) or quality of life (MD –0.03, 95% CI –0.06 to 0.00; studies = 1; participants = 239). None of the included studies reported on adverse events or use of health‐related resources. Authors' conclusions While the review found some beneficial effects of multiple session early psychological interventions in the prevention of PTSD, the certainty of the evidence was low due to the high risk of bias in the included trials. The clear practice implication of this is that, at present, multiple session interventions aimed at everyone exposed to traumatic events cannot be recommended. There are a number of ongoing studies, demonstrating that this is a fast moving field of research. Future updates of this review will integrate the results of these new studies. Plain language summary Multiple session early psychological interventions for prevention of post‐traumatic stress disorder Why was this review important? Traumatic events can have a significant effect on the ability of individuals, families and communities to cope. In the past, single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were widely used with the aim of preventing continuing psychological difficulties. However, previous reviews have found that single session individual interventions have not been effective at preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A range of other forms of intervention have been developed to try to prevent people exposed to trauma from developing PTSD. Who will be interested in this review? • People exposed to traumatic events and their loved ones. • Professionals working in mental health services. • General practitioners. • Commissioners. What questions did this review try to answer? Are multiple session early psychological interventions (i.e. interventions over two or more sessions beginning within the first three months after the traumatic event) more effective than treatment as usual or another psychological intervention in: • reducing the number of people diagnosed with PTSD; • reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms; • reducing the severity of depressive symptoms; • reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms; • improving the general functioning (e.g. social, psychological, occupational and functioning) of recipients of the intervention. Which studies were included in the review? We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that examined multiple session early psychological interventions in the prevention of PTSD, published between 1970 and March 2018. We included 27 studies with 3963 participants. What did the evidence from the review tell us? • We found low‐certainty evidence that multiple session early psychological interventions may be more effective than treatment as usual in preventing PTSD diagnosis three to six months after receiving the intervention. • We found very low‐certainty evidence that multiple session early psychological interventions may be neither more nor less effective than treatment as usual in preventing PTSD, either immediately after, or at seven to 12 months after, the intervention. We also found very low‐certainty evidence that multiple session early psychological interventions may be neither more nor less effective than treatment as usual in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms, either immediately or at subsequent points of follow‐up. • We found low‐certainty evidence that multiple session early psychological interventions may be associated with a higher dropout rate than other psychological interventions. • We found low‐certainty evidence that multiple session early psychological interventions may be neither more nor less effective than other psychological interventions in diagnosing PTSD; reducing the severity of PTSD, depression and anxiety; or in maintaining the general functioning of participants receiving the intervention. • We found no studies that measured adverse effects. • We found no studies that measured use of health‐related resources. What should happen next? The current evidence base is small. However, new studies are being conducted and future updates of this review will incorporate the results of these.

AB: Abstract - Background Bifeprunox is a novel antipsychotic drug designed to treat schizophrenia. However, research into the drug was ceased in 2009 due to rejection of licence to go to market by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who could not approve the drug for acute or long‐term symptoms of schizophrenia because more research was required to demonstrate convincing effects "beyond those already achieved" with currently licenced drugs. There were also concerns expressed over one death of a person whilst on the drug. Objectives To investigate the clinical and adverse effects of bifeprunox for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register on 23 October 2015, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on bifeprunox versus placebo for schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found evidence of missing data and poor reporting. When bifeprunox 20 mg was compared with placebo for schizophrenia, the drug resulted in a reduction of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score regarding positive symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD ‐1.89, 95% CI ‐2.85 to ‐0.92,  low‐quality evidence ) and the PANSS negative subscale regarding negative symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐2.37 to ‐0.69,  low‐quality evidence ). There was a clear improvement regarding deterioration in the bifeprunox 20 mg group (n = 231, 1 RCT, RR 0.71 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.93,  very low‐quality evidence ). The total number of participants with equal to or greater than 7% weight increase was similar between bifeprunox and placebo (n = 483, 1 RCT, RR 1.02 95% CI 0.31 to 3.33  moderate‐quality evidence ). There were no useable data for quality of life, economic outcomes, and service use. Authors' conclusions Our results showed some positive effects and a favourable adverse effect profile for bifeprunox, although there were few data overall and none were of high quality. It would seem that these data alone would not have been enough for the FDA to decide to halt progress of the drug to market. We can only assume that we are missing important data. Both the FDA and the relevant pharmaceutical companies have not made all relevant data accessible. As some of these trials also involved an additional haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone arm, these data are not only relevant to evaluation of bifeprunox. In not making all data accessible, it is hard to see how the FDA and the drug companies have fulfilled their full obligations to people with schizophrenia or their clinicians. Plain language summary Bifeprunox compared with placebo for schizophrenia Review question Is the antipsychotic bifeprunox an effective and safe treatment option for people with schizophrenia? Background Bifeprunox is an antipsychotic, developed to treat schizophrenia. It was thought to be effective for symptoms of schizophrenia whilst causing fewer of the side effects associated with other antipsychotics. However, in 2009 research into the drug was stopped , as it was considered to be no more effective than other available treatments, and there were concerns over the death of one person whilst on the drug. However, as many people with schizophrenia are resistant to current treatments, there is a need to explore new options. Bifeprunox was one of these. We reviewed the available evidence for efficacy, safety, and side effects of bifeprunox, in part to aid in understanding why use of the drug was halted. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched the specialised register in October 2015. He ran an electronic search for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either bifeprunox or placebo, finding 42 records. The review authors screened these for inclusion in the review. Evidence found Only four trials provided useable data, and these were of poor quality with some evidence of missing data. Two trials are completed but not yet published; we could not obtain any information from these trials that we could use in this review. The data available to us showed that bifeprunox improved participants' scores on both positive and negative symptom scales. Weight increase was similar between those receiving bifeprunox and those allocated to placebo. Conclusions Data regarding the effects of bifeprunox are scarce. The data we found, which were of poor quality, showed no real evidence that bifeprunox is unsafe or ineffective. Its effects do not seem significantly different to other drugs that are currently on the market. More data on this compound exists but is not publicly available. We believe that the licencing authority in the USA must have had more information on which to base their important decision. The drug company also seemed to lose the will to move forward with bifeprunox. Whether or not the decision to prohibit access to a potentially useful drug was taken because of clear evidence of adverse effects, market calculations, or biases, it would seem an omission that all information upon which this decision was made is not in the public domain.

AB: Abstract - Background Studies report that up to 80% of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may struggle with symptoms of depression. However, this major comorbidity in COPD is rarely managed effectively. A number of recent studies indicate that left untreated, COPD‐related depression is associated with worse quality of life, worse compliance with COPD treatment plan, increased exacerbations, hospital admissions, and healthcare costs when compared to individuals with COPD without depression. Regrettably, COPD practice guidelines do not provide conclusive treatment recommendations for the use of antidepressants in patients with COPD, and base their guidelines on findings from trials in the general population. This may be problematic, as there is an elevated risk of respiratory issues associated with antidepressant treatment and COPD. Evaluating effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions specifically for patients with COPD and depression was therefore paramount. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in patients with COPD. Search methods The last search was performed on 26 November 2018. We initially searched the following databases via the Specialised Trials Registers of the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups (to June 2016): MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and the Cochrane Library trials register (CENTRAL). Searches from June 2016 to November 2018 were performed directly on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 26 November 2018. We searched the grey literature databases to identify studies not indexed in major databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full‐text screening. Selection criteria All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of pharmacological interventions with no intervention, placebo or co‐intervention in adults with diagnosed COPD and depression were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed articles identified by the search for eligibility. Our primary outcomes were change in depressive symptoms and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were: change in quality of life, change in dyspnoea, change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), change in exercise tolerance, change in hospital utilisation (length of stay and readmission rates), and cost‐effectiveness. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the pooled mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI using a random‐effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. Main results Of the 1125 records screened for eligibility, four RCTs (N = 201 participants), and one on‐going study, met the inclusion criteria. Two classes of antidepressants were investigated in two separate comparisons with placebo: a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). TCA versus placebo Only one RCT (N = 30 participants) provided results for this comparison. Primary outcomes The TCA (nortriptyline) reduced depressive symptoms post‐treatment compared to placebo (MD ‐10.20, 95% CI ‐16.75 to ‐3.65; P = 0.007; very low‐quality evidence), as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D). Three participants withdrew from the trial due to adverse events related to the tested antidepressant (dry mouth, sedation, orthostatic hypotension). Secondary outcomes The overall results post‐treatment indicated that nortriptyline was not effective in improving the quality of life of individuals with COPD, as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile (MD ‐2.80, 95% CI ‐11.02 to 5.42; P = 0.50; very low‐quality evidence). The results for the change in dyspnoea for the domains examined (e.g. dyspnoea scores for 'most day‐to‐day activities') post‐treatment showed no improvement in the intervention group (MD 9.80, 95% CI ‐6.20 to 25.80; P = 0.23; very low‐quality evidence). No data were reported for change in FEV 1 , change in exercise tolerance, change in hospital utilisation, or cost‐effectiveness. The TCA study provided short‐term results, with the last follow‐up data collection at 12 weeks. The quality of the evidence for all the outcomes evaluated was very low due to a small sample size, imprecision, attrition, and selection and reporting bias. SSRIs versus placebo Three RCTs (N = 171 participants) provided results for this comparison. Primary outcomes The pooled results for two studies showed no difference for the change in depressive symptoms post‐intervention (SMD 0.75, 95% CI ‐1.14 to 2.64; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.44; very low‐quality evidence). High heterogeneity was observed (I² = 95%), limiting the reliability of these findings. While it was not possible to meta‐analyse the total adverse events rates across the studies, it was possible to combine the results for two medication‐specific adverse effects: nausea and dizziness. There were no significant post‐treatment group differences for nausea (OR 2.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.12; 171 participants; 3 studies; P = 0.19; very low‐quality evidence) or dizziness (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.06; 143 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.61; very low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes The pooled analysis of two trials reporting data for the change in quality of life did not show improvement post‐treatment in the intervention group compared to placebo (SMD 1.17, 95% CI ‐0.80 to 3.15; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in change in FEV 1  post‐treatment (MD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.05; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.60; low‐quality evidence). However, two trials reported improvement in exercise tolerance in the SSRI group versus the placebo group (MD 13.88, 95% CI 11.73 to 16.03; 148 participants; 2 studies; P < 0.001; very low‐quality evidence). The trials included in this comparison did not report data related to the change in dyspnoea, hospital utilisation rates, or cost‐effectiveness. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to make definitive statements about the efficacy or safety of antidepressants for treating COPD‐related depression. New RCTs are needed; with better methodological quality and more accurate reporting of the methods used. Moreover, longer‐term follow‐up data collection is needed, including outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and cost‐effectiveness. Plain language summary Medication for the treatment of depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term that mainly describes two lung conditions: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, persistent cough, wheezing, and/or frequent chest infections. There is no cure for COPD, but treatment can help slow the disease progress and relieve symptoms. Depression is very common in patients with COPD, but is often untreated. Studies show that untreated depression in patients with COPD can worsen quality of life, increase COPD exacerbations and hospital admissions, and make following a COPD treatment plan difficult. Treatment for depression can include antidepressant medication, psychological therapy, or both. However, evidence‐based recommendations regarding antidepressant medication use specifically for patients with COPD are not currently available. Why is this review important? There is currently no clear overview of existing evidence showing whether antidepressants can effectively and safely reduce depressive symptoms in patients with COPD, therefore it was important to assess the existing experimental studies. Who will be interested in this review? Healthcare professionals, people with COPD and depression, researchers, and policymakers will be interested in the findings of this review. What questions does this review aim to answer? Our main aim was to assess whether pharmacological treatment (e.g. antidepressants) could effectively and safely treat COPD‐related depression. Which studies were included in the review? This review included experimental studies called randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to a treatment group based on a random method) that compared the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions (antidepressants) to placebo (inactive treatment in the same form as the active treatment, e.g. a pill). Study participants were adults diagnosed with COPD and depression. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We have identified only four studies worldwide that were eligible for inclusion in our review. This means limited evidence to support the use of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in patients with COPD. Only one study evaluated a tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline, finding that it reduced depressive symptoms when compared to a placebo. Three studies evaluated a newer generation class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), finding no evidence for their effectiveness in improving depressive symptoms. Due to the limited evidence, we are unable to make definitive statements about the effectiveness but also safety of antidepressants when used for COPD‐related depression. However, SSRIs may increase exercise capacity in patients with COPD. Given that the current findings were based on only four small studies with evidence rated as of very low quality, it is important to interpret our results with caution. What should happen next? Insufficient evidence prevented us from making clear recommendations for doctors, other healthcare professionals, researchers, or policymakers. More studies with better methodological quality and a larger number of participants are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia has a lifetime prevalence of less than one per cent. Studies have indicated that early symptoms that are idiosyncratic to the person with schizophrenia (early warning signs) often precede acute psychotic relapse. Early warning signs interventions propose that learning to detect and manage early warning signs of impending relapse might prevent or delay acute psychotic relapse. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual involving and not involving a psychological therapy on time to relapse, hospitalisation, functioning, negative and positive symptomatology. Search methods Search databases included the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007 and May 2012) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were reviewed for inclusion. We inspected the UK National Research Registe and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual for people with schizophrenia or other non‐affective psychosis Data collection and analysis We assessed included studies for quality and extracted data. If more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up, the study was excluded. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD) with standard errors estimated, and for time to event outcomes we calculated Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and associated 95 % CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and assessed overall study quality using the GRADE approach. Main results Thirty‐two RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs that randomised 3554 people satisfied criteria for inclusion. Only one study examined the effects of early warning signs interventions without additional psychological interventions, and many of the outcomes for this review were not reported or poorly‐reported. Significantly fewer people relapsed with early warning signs interventions than with usual care (23% versus 43%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79; 15 RCTs, 1502 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to relapse did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs, 550 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Risk of re‐hospitalisation was significantly lower with early warning signs interventions compared to usual care (19% versus 39%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; 15 RCTS, 1457 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to re‐hospitalisation did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs; 1149 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Participants' satisfaction with care and economic costs were inconclusive because of a lack of evidence. Authors' conclusions This review indicates that early warning signs interventions may have a positive effect on the proportions of people re‐hospitalised and on rates of relapse, but not on time to recurrence. However, the overall quality of the evidence was very low, indicating that we do not know if early warning signs interventions will have similar effects outside trials and that it is very likely that further research will alter these estimates. Moreover, the early warning signs interventions were used along side other psychological interventions, and we do not know if they would be effective on their own. They may be cost‐effective due to reduced hospitalisation and relapse rates, but before mental health services consider routinely providing psychological interventions involving the early recognition and prompt management of early warning signs to adults with schizophrenia, further research is required to provide evidence of high or moderate quality regarding the efficacy of early warning signs interventions added to usual care without additional psychological interventions, or to clarify the kinds of additional psychological interventions that might aid its efficacy. Future RCTs should be adequately‐powered, and designed to minimise the risk of bias and be transparently reported. They should also systematically evaluate resource costs and resource use, alongside efficacy outcomes and other outcomes that are important to people with serious mental illness and their carers. Plain language summary Training to recognise the early signs of recurrence in schizophrenia Many people with schizophrenia experience periods of illness followed by relatively stable periods (although symptoms of illness such as hearing voices and seeing things often remain in the background). This means that many people with schizophrenia may become unwell again and need to go back into hospital. Training in early warning signs techniques encourages people to learn, detect and recognise the early warning signs of future illness. Studies indicate that noticing even small changes in signs and symptoms of schizophrenia can often predict future illness and relapse two to 10 weeks later. Early warning training may help to prevent or delay relapse, so reducing the chances of going into hospital. Recognition of early warning signs requires detailed history taking, sometimes with additional techniques such as diary keeping, completion of questionnaires and a plan of action based on anticipated early warning signs. Training can be undertaken by the individual or be group‐based, involving health professionals, family members or carers. Successful training seems to require around 12 sessions and involves therapists of high competency.     This review includes a total of 34 studies. It found that there are positive benefits of training in early warning signs. It reduces rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation (but not on time to recurrence). It should be noted that training in early warning signs was mainly used alongside other psychological therapies, so it is not entirely clear what proportion of the positive effect is due to training in early warning signs alone. Moreover, the overall quality of the evidence from these studies was judged to be very low. This means that we do not know if interventions using early warning signs, with or without additional psychological treatments, will have the same beneficial effects outside clinical trials.     Further research is required to decide whether training in early warning signs is effective on its own. Effects on quality of life, satisfaction with care, money spent, and burden of care for carers are unclear, so ideally should be known before training programmes are put into wider use. At this time, there is not enough evidence to support training in early warning signs alone. This plain language summary was written by consumer, Ben Gray of RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background Vitamins and minerals have many functions in the nervous system which are important for brain health. It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objectives To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised, placebo‐controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Data collection and analysis We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random‐effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome. Main results We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low‐quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low‐quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha‐tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate‐quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low‐quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low‐quality and so could not be sure of any effects. Authors' conclusions The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high‐dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication. Plain language summary Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment Review question This review investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment can reduce their risk of developing dementia, or can prevent their memory or other thinking skills from deteriorating further, by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Background Slight changes in memory and thinking skills are common as people get older. When these changes are worse than can be expected in normal ageing, but are not bad enough to make a person's usual activities difficult to manage, then the person is said to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia in the future. Vitamins and minerals are naturally occurring substances which are needed in the diet to maintain health. They have lots of different functions in the body and many are essential to keep the brain working properly. It has been suggested that supplementing a person's normal diet with extra doses of these vitamins or minerals might help to maintain thinking skills or prevent dementia. Study characteristics We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. Key results and quality of the evidence Vitamin B combination versus placebo Five trials with a total of 879 participants compared B vitamins with placebo. Four used combinations of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid; one small study tested folic acid on its own. None of these studies reported whether or not participants developed dementia. These studies did not find that memory or thinking skills differed between the group of people who took vitamin B supplements and those who took placebo after treatment lasting six months to two years. Our confidence in the results on different tests used in the studies varied from moderate to very low. Two years of vitamin B supplements did seem to help memory in a small subgroup of participants in one study who could be identified by a particular blood test at the start of the trial. One study found that there was probably no effect on participants' quality of life. One study scanned the brains of some participants and reported that B vitamins may slow the rate of brain shrinkage. Harmful effects and deaths were reported in very few participants and we cannot conclude whether or not there are harms from taking these or similar combinations of B vitamins. Vitamin E versus placebo. One study with 516 participants compared a relatively high dose of vitamin E (2000 IU a day) to placebo in people who were also taking a multivitamin containing 15 IU of vitamin E (the daily requirement for vitamin E is approximately 30 IU). The risk of developing dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (the commonest form of dementia) is probably not affected by three years of treatment with high‐dose vitamin E. The quality of the evidence for other outcomes was lower, but there may also be no effect of this dose of vitamin E on specific memory or thinking skills or on how well people could manage their daily activities. Vitamin E and C versus placebo One study with 256 participants compared a combination of vitamins C and E with placebo. It found no effect on overall memory and thinking skills, but we had little confidence in this result because of the quality of the evidence. Chromium picolinate versus placebo Only one very small study with 26 participants investigated the effect of chromium supplements. This study was too small for us to be able to draw any conclusions. Conclusions The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms. More research is needed before we can answer our review question.

AB: Abstract - Background Up to 75% of people with serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have co‐occurring substance use disorders (dual diagnosis). Dual diagnosis can have an adverse effect on treatment and prognosis of SMI. Objectives To evaluate the effects of risperidone compared to treatment with other antipsychotics (first‐generation and other second‐generation antipsychotics) used in people with serious mental illness and co‐occurring substance misuse. Search methods On 6 January 2016 and 9 October 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers). Selection criteria We selected randomised trials of risperidone versus any other antipsychotic in people with SMI and substance abuse (dual diagnosis). We included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. We excluded trials that either did not meet our inclusion criteria or met our inclusion criteria but did not report any useable data. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and selected studies. For included studies, we independently extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% confidence intervals. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analyses and assessed the quality of evidence, creating a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified eight randomised trials containing a total of 1073 participants with SMI and co‐occurring substance misuse. Seven of these contributed useable data to the review. There was heterogeneity in trial design and measurement. Risperidone was compared to clozapine, olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. Few trials compared risperidone with first‐generation agents. Few trials examined participants with a dual diagnosis from the outset and most trials only contained separate analyses of subgroups with a dual diagnosis or were secondary data analyses of subgroups of people with a dual diagnosis from existing larger trials. For risperidone versus clozapine we found no clear differences between these two antipsychotics in the reduction of positive psychotic symptoms (1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), n = 36, mean difference (MD) 0.90, 95% CI −2.21 to 4.01,  very low quality evidence ), or reduction in cannabis use (1 RCT, n = 14, risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.35,  very low quality evidence ), improvement in subjective well‐being (1 RCT, n = 36, MD −6.00, 95% CI −14.82 to 2.82,  very low quality evidence ), numbers discontinuing medication (1 RCT, n = 36, RR 4.05, 95% CI 0.21 to 78.76,  very low quality evidence ), extrapyramidal side‐effects (2 RCTs, n = 50, RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.30 to 24.08; I² = 0%,  very low quality evidence ), or leaving the study early (2 RCTs, n = 45, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.51; I² = 34%,  very low quality evidence ). Clozapine was associated with lower levels of craving for cannabis (1 RCT, n = 28, MD 7.00, 95% CI 2.37 to 11.63,  very low quality evidence ). For risperidone versus olanzapine we found no clear differences in the reduction of positive psychotic symptoms (1 RCT, n = 37, MD −1.50, 95% CI −3.82 to 0.82,  very low quality evidence ), reduction in cannabis use (1 RCT, n = 41, MD 0.40, 95% CI −4.72 to 5.52,  very low quality evidence ), craving for cannabis (1 RCT, n = 41, MD 5.00, 95% CI −4.86 to 14.86,  very low quality evidence ), parkinsonism (1 RCT, n = 16, MD −0.08, 95% CI −1.21 to 1.05,  very low quality evidence ), or leaving the study early (2 RCT, n = 77, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35; I² = 0%,  very low quality evidence ). For risperidone versus perphenazine, we found no clear differences in the number of participants leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 281, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20,  low‐quality evidence ). For risperidone versus quetiapine, we found no clear differences in the number of participants leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 294, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07,  low‐quality evidence ). For risperidone versus ziprasidone, we found no clear differences in the number of participants leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 240, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10,  low‐quality evidence ). For many comparisons, important outcomes were missing; and no data were reported in any study for metabolic disturbances, global impression of illness severity, quality of life or mortality. Authors' conclusions There is not sufficient good‐quality evidence available to determine the effects of risperidone compared with other antipsychotics in people with a dual diagnosis. Few trials compared risperidone with first‐generation agents, leading to limited applicability to settings where access to second‐generation agents is limited, such as in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Moreover, heterogeneity in trial design and measurement of outcomes precluded the use of many trials in our analyses. Future trials in this area need to be sufficiently powered but also need to conform to consistent methods in study population selection, use of measurement scales, definition of outcomes, and measures to counter risk of bias. Investigators should adhere to CONSORT guidelines in the reporting of results. Plain language summary Risperidone versus other antipsychotics for people with dual diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol or drug use disorder What is dual diagnosis? Dual diagnosis is a term used to describe people who have both a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol or drug use disorder. Up to 75% of people with a serious mental illness (SMI) are dual diagnosis. It has been suggested that one of the reasons behind the high levels of substance use in people with SMI is due to 'self‐medication', with patients taking additional drugs in order to counter their distressing symptoms. People with a dual diagnosis have been shown to have more complications in their treatment, including higher rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation, more contact with legal and forensic services, higher levels of psychotic symptoms, more risk‐taking behaviour, greater levels of side‐effects to antipsychotics and lower medication adherence. Antipsychotics are the main treatment for SMI. It has been suggested that second‐generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as risperidone may be superior to older, first‐generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in improving negative affective states, reducing drug craving, improving subjective well‐being, and may lead to fewer side‐effects and hence greater medication adherence. Such improvements in symptoms may lead to less self‐medication with alcohol and drugs, and improved overall mental states. However it remains unclear to what extent risperidone, one of the first atypical antipsychotics to be manufactured, is superior to other antipsychotics for dual diagnosis. Who may be interested in this review? Mental health care practitioners who treat people with SMI and dual diagnosis, and who prescribe antipsychotics for these conditions. People who use mental health services and their families who may be involved in their treatment and care. What does this review aim to answer? How effective and safe is risperidone compared to other antipsychotics for treating people with a dual diagnosis? Which studies were included in the review? We conducted searches for relevant randomised studies in January 2016 and October 2017. We found eight randomised controlled trials with 1073 participants who had a dual diagnosis. The majority of participants were adults over 18 years (4 participants were 17 years). Risperidone was compared to clozapine, olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We found no great effect favouring risperidone over any of the other comparison medications. Very limited data were available for side‐effects; and again, we found no real differences between risperidone and other antipsychotics. Overall the quality of the evidence available was graded as low to very low, and currently there is not sufficient evidence to indicate risperidone is superior or inferior to other antipsychotics in the treatment of people with severe mental illness and co‐occurring substance misuse. What should happen next? More high‐quality research is needed. Future research should include samples sufficiently large to detect meaningful clinical differences in outcomes.

AB: Abstract - Background In most western industrialised countries, second generation (atypical) antipsychotics are recommended as first‐line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia. In this review, we specifically examine how the efficacy and tolerability of one such agent ‐ aripiprazole ‐ differs from that of other comparable second generation antipsychotics. Objectives To review the effects of aripiprazole compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2012), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing aripiprazole (oral) with oral and parenteral forms of amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and used GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. Main results We now have included 174 trials involving 17,244 participants. Aripiprazole was compared with clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and olanzapine. The overall number of participants leaving studies early was 30% to 40%, limiting validity (no differences between groups). When compared with clozapine, there were no significant differences for global state (no clinically significant response, n = 2132, 29 RCTs,  low quality evidence ); mental state (BPRS, n = 426, 5 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 240, 3 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Quality of life score using the WHO‐QOL‐100 scale demonstrated significant difference, favouring aripiprazole (n = 132, 2 RCTs, RR 2.59 CI 1.43 to 3.74,  very low quality evidence ). General extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were no different between groups (n = 520, 8 RCTs, very low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning or service use. When compared with quetiapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 991, 12 RCTs,  low quality evidence ); mental state (PANSS positive symptoms, n = 583, 7 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); leaving the study early for any reason (n = 168, 2 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ), or general EPS symptoms (n = 348, 4 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Results were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for quality of life (WHO‐QOL‐100 total score, n = 100, 1 RCT, MD 2.60 CI 1.31 to 3.89,  very low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning or service use. When compared with risperidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 6381, 80 RCTs,  low quality evidence ); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 1239, 12 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Data were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for improvement in mental state using the BPRS (n = 570, 5 RCTs, MD 1.33 CI 2.24 to 0.42,  very low quality evidence ); with higher adverse effects seen in participants receiving risperidone of general EPS symptoms (n = 2605, 31 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.31 to 0.50,  low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use. When compared with ziprasidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 442, 6 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); mental state using the BPRS (n = 247, 1 RCT,  very low quality evidence ); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 316, 2 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Weight gain was significantly greater in people receiving aripiprazole (n = 232, 3 RCTs, RR 4.01 CI 1.10 to 14.60,  very low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use. When compared with olanzapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 1739, 11 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); mental state using PANSS (n = 1500, 11 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); or quality of life using the GQOLI‐74 scale (n = 68, 1 RCT,  very low quality of evidence ). Significantly more people receiving aripiprazole left the study early due to any reason (n = 2331, 9 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 1.05 to 1.25,  low quality evidence ) and significantly more people receiving olanzapine gained weight (n = 1538, 9 RCTs, RR 0.25 CI 0.15 to 0.43,  very low quality evidence ). None of the included studies provided outcome data for the comparisons of 'service use' or 'general functioning'. Authors' conclusions Information on all comparisons is of limited quality, is incomplete and problematic to apply clinically. The quality of the evidence is all low or very low. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug with an important adverse effect profile. Long‐term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerge from ongoing larger, independent pragmatic trials. Plain language summary Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics In many countries in the industrialised world there has been a huge growth in the prescription of medication for people with mental health problems, taken orally as a tablet or by injection. Atypical and second generation antipsychotic drugs have become ever more popular, because they are thought to help people with mental health problems who do not respond quite so well to initial treatment. These newer drugs hold the promise of both reducing symptoms, such as hearing voices or seeing things, and reducing problematic side effects, such as sleepiness, weight gain, and shaking. However, there is little research and comparison of the ways in which drugs differ from one another. This review examines the effectiveness of aripiprazole with other new antipsychotics.    Originally the review included 12 research trials. After an update search carried out in November 2012, 162 trials were added. Most of these trials were from China and although new data were added to the review, overall conclusions did not change. The review now has five comparisons with aripiprazole being compared with clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. For people with schizophrenia it may be important to know that aripiprazole may not be as good or effective as olanzapine but that it has less side effects. Aripiprazole is similar in effectiveness to risperidone and somewhat better than ziprasidone. Aripiprazole had less side‐ effects than olanzapine and risperidone (such as weight gain, sleepiness, heart problems, shaking and increased cholesterol levels). Aripiprazole was not as good as ziprasidone for dealing with restlessness or people’s inability to sit still. Comparison with other antipsychotic drugs as a group showed that people preferred taking aripiprazole. However, people with schizophrenia as well as mental health professionals and policy makers should know that the evidence is limited and mostly of low or very low quality. More trials and research is required, including on outcomes such as: quality of life; the views of service users and carers; and patient preference.

AB: Abstract - Background Risperidone is a widely used antipsychotic drug for people with schizophrenia. It is important to get a balance between gaining the most positive effects for the least negative outcomes. The optimal dose of risperidone is the focus of this review. Objectives To determine risperidone dose response relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (July 2008) for all relevant references. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreement by discussion with a third member of the team. When insufficient data were provided, we contacted the study authors. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (MD). Main results A consistent finding when risperidone ultra low doses (<2 mg/day) were compared with other doses (short‐term data) was that more people left early because of insufficient response (n=456, 1 RCT, RR when compared with standard‐low (≧4‐<6 mg/day) 12.48 CI 1.43 to 4.30). The insufficient response for this low dose is reflected in measures of mental state. When low doses (≧2‐<4 mg/day) are used and compared with standard‐higher doses (≧6‐<10 mg/day) and the high dose range (≧10 mg/day), more people left early because of insufficient response (≧4‐<6 mg/day: n=173, 2 RCTs, RR 4.05 CI 1.09 to 15.07; ≧10 mg/day: n=173, 2 RCTs, RR 1.92 CI 1.36 to 2.70). For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement' results favour standard‐higher doses (n=272, 2 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 0.81 to 6.34). When low doses are compared with other higher doses, we found no differences in terms of cardiovascular, CNS, endocrine or gastrointestinal adverse effects. Unspecified EPS were more frequent with the higher doses (≧10 mg: n=262, 2 RCTs, RR 0.45 CI 0.24 to 0.84). One trial did find that endpoint scores on PANSS significantly favoured a low dose when compared with ≧4‐6 mg/day (n=124, 1 RCT, MD ‐12.40 CI ‐17.01 to ‐7.79). When ≧4‐<6 mg/day is compared with high doses, less people left early (n=677, 1 RCT, RR leaving any reason 0.74 CI 0.54 to 1.00; n=677, 1 RCT, RR due to adverse effects 0.56 CI 0.32 to 0.97). ≧4‐<6 mg/day was no worse than ≧6‐<10 mg/day for 'no clinically important improvement' (n=39, 1 RCT, RR on CGI‐I 0.79 CI 0.29 to 2.17). People allocated ≧4‐<6 mg/day had more movement disorders than those on a low dose (n=124 1 RCT, RR 2.28 CI 1.67 to 3.11). When ≧6‐<10 mg/day is compared with standard‐lower doses and a high dose range, there is no significant difference in terms of proportions leaving early. ≧6‐<10 mg/day is better than a low dose for 'no clinical important improvement' (n=172, 2 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.61 to 0.94). Overall ≧6‐<10 mg/day caused less problems especially in EPS when compared with ≧10mg/day (n=261, 2 RCTs, RR unspecified EPS 0.56 CI 0.31 to 0.99). When a high dose was compared with a low dose less people left early (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.43 CI 0.26 to 0.71) but not when compared with a standard‐lower dose (n=677, 1 RCT, RR leaving due to adverse event 1.78 CI 1.03 to 3.09). ≧10 mg/day was better than a low dose in terms of 'no clinical important improvement' (n=257, 2 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.50 to 0.82), but worse than a standard‐higher dose (≧6‐<10 mg/day: n=255, 2 RCTs, RR 1.22 CI 1.00 to 1.51). ≧10 mg/day caused more unspecified EPS adverse effects and any drug for adverse events when compared with a standard‐higher dose and with a low dose. Authors' conclusions There is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. The quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid‐range doses. One such dose (standard‐lower dose range, 4‐<6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. Weak evidence suggests that low doses (≧2‐<4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. High doses (≧10 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. Ultra low dose (<2 mg/day) seemed useless. We advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard‐lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. Future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community. Plain language summary Risperidone dose for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness which, for some people can become a long term problem. The usual first line treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, because of the adverse effects these drugs can have, over time those taking them try to find a dose where they are gaining the most therapeutic benefit for the least amount of medication and doctors will often support them to do this. Conversely, for those whose illness does not respond well to medication, high doses are often used. This can cause severe adverse effects and can set up a cycle where individuals gain some benefit from the medication, develop side effects, then stop taking it and relapse. Therefore it would be helpful to find the optimum dose of each antipsychotic for different groups of people.   This review compares different doses of the antipsychotic risperidone, a drug introduced in the early 1990s and widely prescribed. Eleven trials were found comparing data for 2498 people. They were all under 12 weeks in length. Some looked at people in the first episode of schizophrenia or in an acute relapse, while others looked at those with a chronic long‐term illness. For the purposes of this review doses of risperidone were divided into the following daily doses, ultra‐low (less than 2mg), low (2mg ‐ just less than 4mg), standard lower (4mg ‐ just less than 6mg), standard higher (6mg ‐ just less than 10mg) and high (10mg or more).   In the low and ultra low groups, there were a significant number of people leaving the study because of insufficient response, while those in the high dose group were more likely to leave the study for ‘any reason’ or ‘adverse event’. There were no significant differences between the standard lower and standard higher groups in improvement in general, or mental state, but both of these were better than an ultra low dose and gave less adverse effects than a high dose. There was some evidence to show that those in their first episode also respond well to a low dose. There were no good data on service use or quality of life. If further trials are conducted comparing different doses of risperidone, they should concentrate on specific groups of people, for example those in first episode or those with a chronic illness living in the community.

AB: Abstract - Background Chlorpromazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine, which is one of the widely‐used typical antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine is reliable for its efficacy and one of the most tested first generation antipsychotic drugs. It has been used as a ‘gold standard’ to compare the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Expensive new generation drugs are heavily marketed worldwide as a better treatment for schizophrenia, but this may not be the case and an unnecessary drain on very limited resources. Objectives To compare the effects of chlorpromazine with atypical or second generation antipsychotic drugs, for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register up to 23 September 2013. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorpromazine with any other atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Adults (as defined in each trial) diagnosed with schizophrenia, including schizophreniform, schizoaffective and delusional disorders were included in this review. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently screened the articles identified in the literature search against the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included trials. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we determined the mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results This review includes 71 studies comparing chlorpromazine to olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine. None of the included trials reported any data on economic costs. 1. Chlorpromazine versus olanzapine In the short term, there appeared to be a significantly greater clinical response (as defined in each study) in people receiving olanzapine (3 RCTs, N = 204; RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.99,  low quality evidence ). There was no difference between drugs for relapse (1 RCT, N = 70; RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.86,  very low quality evidence ), nor in average endpoint score using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for mental state (4 RCTs, N = 245; MD 3.21, 95% CI −0.62 to 7.05, very low quality evidence ). There were significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms experienced amongst people receiving chlorpromazine (2 RCTs, N = 298; RR 34.47, 95% CI 4.79 to 248.30, very low quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings using the general quality of life interview (GQOLI) ‐ physical health subscale were more favourable with people receiving olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 61; MD −10.10, 95% CI −13.93 to −6.27,  very low quality evidence ). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (3 RCTs, N = 139; RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.40,  very low quality evidence ). 2. Chlorpromazine versus risperidone In the short term, there appeared to be no difference in clinical response (as defined in each study) between chlorpromazine or risperidone (7 RCTs, N = 475; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.34,  low quality of evidence ), nor in average endpoint score using the BPRS for mental state 4 RCTs, N = 247; MD 0.90, 95% CI −3.49 to 5.28,  very low quality evidence ), or any observed extrapyramidal adverse effects (3 RCTs, N = 235; RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.40, very low quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings using the QOL scale were significantly more favourable with people receiving risperidone (1 RCT, N = 100; MD −14.2, 95% CI −20.50 to −7.90,  very low quality evidence ). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (one RCT, N = 41; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.11,  very low quality evidence ). 3. Chlorpromazine versus quetiapine In the short term, there appeared to be no difference in clinical response (as defined in each study) between chlorpromazine or quetiapine (28 RCTs, N = 3241; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06,  moderate quality evidence ) nor in average endpoint score using the BPRS for mental state (6 RCTs, N = 548; MD −0.18, 95% CI −1.23 to 0.88 , very low quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings using the GQOL1‐74 scale were significantly more favourable with people receiving quetiapine (1 RCT, N = 59; MD −6.49, 95% CI −11.30 to −1.68,  very low quality evidence ). Significantly more people receiving chlorpromazine experienced extrapyramidal adverse effects (8 RCTs, N = 644; RR 8.03, 95% CI 4.78 to 13.51,  low quality of evidence ). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early in the short term (12 RCTs, N = 1223; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.41, moderate quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Most included trials included inpatients from hospitals in China. Therefore the results of this Cochrane review are more applicable to the Chinese population. Mostincluded trials were short term studies, therefore we cannot comment on the medium and long term use of chlorpromazine compared to atypical antipsychotics. Low qualityy evidence suggests chlorpromazine causes more extrapyramidal adverse effects. However, all studiesused varying dose ranges, and higher doses would be expected to be associated with more adverse events. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine compared with newer atypical antipsychotics People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for people with these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective for treating people with schizophrenia. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments. However, being an older drug (typical or first generation) it also has serious side effects, including blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. In this Cochrane review we examined the effects of chlorpromazine for treating people with schizophrenia compared with newer antipsychotic drugs. We searched the literature for randomised controlled trials up to 23 September 2013, and included 71 trials. The included studies compared chlorpromazine with three newer antipsychotics: risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Most included trials were short term studies and undertaken in China. Based on low quality evidence, we found that chlorpromazine is not much different to risperidone or quetiapine but is associated with more side effects. More favourable results were found for olanzapine with those receiving olanzapine experiencing fewer side effects and greater improvements in global state and quality of life than those receiving chlorpromazine, but again this is based on low quality evidence. Larger, longer, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction with treatment or care, relapse, costs and hospital discharge or admission. Also, more international studies are needed. Outpatient treatment was under‐represented in the included studies, and future research should also include work with this group of people. Due to the limitations of evidence in this Cochrane review, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Chlorpormazine is available widely, is comparable with the newer antipsychotics and is relatively cheap so despite its propensity to cause side effects, is likely to remain one of the benchmark antipsychotics. The plain language summary has been written by a consumer. Ben Gray: Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation.  http://mcpin.org/ .

AB: Abstract - Background People experiencing acute psychotic illnesses, especially those associated with agitated or violent behaviour, may require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, has been used for this purpose in several countries. Objectives To estimate the effects of droperidol, including its cost‐effectiveness, when compared to placebo, other 'standard' or 'non‐standard' treatments, or other forms of management of psychotic illness, in controlling acutely disturbed behaviour and reducing psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (18 December 2015). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted authors of trials. We supplemented these electronic searches by handsearching reference lists and contacting both the pharmaceutical industry and relevant authors. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data that compared droperidol to any other treatment for people acutely ill with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder or a brief psychotic episode. Data collection and analysis For included studies, we assessed quality, risk of bias and extracted data. We excluded data when more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We identified four relevant trials from the update search (previous version of this review included only two trials). When droperidol was compared with placebo, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31,  high‐quality evidence ). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for the droperidol group (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85,  high‐quality evidence ). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.52,  low‐quality evidence ) than placebo. For 'being ready for discharge', there was no clear difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48,  high‐quality evidence ). There were no data for mental state and costs. Similarly, when droperidol was compared to haloperidol, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09,  high‐quality evidence ). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for participants in the droperidol group (2 RCTs, N = 255, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.90,  high‐quality evidence ). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular hypotension (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 26.49, moderate‐quality evidence ) and cardiovascular hypotension/desaturation (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.12 to 67.98,  low‐quality evidence ) than haloperidol. There was no suggestion that use of droperidol was unsafe. For mental state, there was no evidence of clear difference between the efficacy of droperidol compared to haloperidol (Scale for Quantification of Psychotic Symptom Severity, 1 RCT, N = 40, mean difference (MD) 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.29,  low‐quality evidence ). There were no data for service use and costs. Whereas, when droperidol was compared with midazolam, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found droperidol to be less acutely tranquillising than midazolam (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.28,  high‐quality evidence ). As regards the 'need for additional medication by 60 minutes after initial adequate sedation, we found an effect (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.20,  moderate‐quality evidence ). In terms of adverse effects, we found no statistically significant differences between the two drugs for either airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55,  low‐quality evidence ) or respiratory hypoxia (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.03,  moderate‐quality evidence ) ‐ but use of midazolam did result in three people (out of around 70) needing some sort of 'airway management' with no such events in the droperidol group. There were no data for mental state, service use and costs. Furthermore, when droperidol was compared to olanzapine, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by any time point, we found no clear differences between the older drug (droperidol) and olanzapine (e.g. at 30 minutes: 1 RCT, N = 221, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11,  high‐quality evidence ). There was a suggestion that participants allocated droperidol needed less additional medication after 60 minutes than people given the olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87,  high‐quality evidence ). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.72,  low‐quality evidence ) than olanzapine. For 'being ready for discharge', there was no difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 221, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.34,  high‐quality evidence ). There were no data for mental state and costs. Authors' conclusions Previously, the use of droperidol was justified based on experience rather than evidence from well‐conducted and reported randomised trials. However, this update found high‐quality evidence with minimal risk of bias to support the use of droperidol for acute psychosis. Also, we found no evidence to suggest that droperidol should not be a treatment option for people acutely ill and disturbed because of serious mental illnesses. Plain language summary Droperidol for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation Is droperidol effective for managing people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis? Background People with psychosis can experience symptoms such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) or delusions (belief in things that are bizarre or obviously not true). These symptoms are often disturbing and frightening, and can lead to people with psychosis becoming very disturbed, violent or agitated. Droperidol is one of the medicines normally used to help calm (tranquillise) people in this situation. Previously, the use of this drug was based on results from small clinical trials with no firm conclusion regarding its effects. Larger trials were needed. Searching In 2015, the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group updated previous searches of their specialised register of studies. The review authors identified and screened 21 records. Description of studies Six randomised controlled studies are now included in the review. All the studies randomised people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis to receive either droperidol or placebo (a pretend medicine), haloperidol, olanzapine or midazolam. The size of the studies ranged from 40 to 221 participants. All took place in within a hospital. Four of the six studies were under two hours of duration. Main results Compared to placebo, droperidol was more effective at tranquillising agitated participants 30 minutes after taking it. Similar results were found for tranquillisation when droperidol was compared with haloperidol but this effect was less clear, and not evident when droperidol was compared to midazolam or olanzapine. Droperidol did not cause more side effects than the other drugs in the studies. The studies did not look at costs. Review authors' conclusions Although we could only include six studies, they provided high‐quality evidence suggesting that droperidol is effective and can be used to control people with very disturbed and aggressive behaviours caused by psychosis.

AB: Abstract - Background Risperidone is the first new‐generation antipsychotic drug made available in the market in its generic form. Objectives To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost‐effectiveness of risperidone compared with placebo for treating schizophrenia. Search methods On 19th October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We checked the references of all included studies and contacted industry and authors of included studies for relevant studies and data. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and the 95% CI. We created a 'Summary of findings table' using  GRADE  (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results The review includes 15 studies (N = 2428). Risk of selection bias is unclear in most of the studies, especially concerning allocation concealment. Other areas of risk such as missing data and selective reporting also caused some concern, although not affected on the direction of effect of our primary outcome, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. Many of the included trials have industry sponsorship of involvement. Nonetheless, generally people in the risperidone group are more likely to achieve a significant clinical improvement in mental state (6 RCTs, N = 864, RR 0.64, CI 0.52 to 0.78,  very low‐quality evidence ). The effect withstood, even when three studies with >50% attrition rate were removed from the analysis (3 RCTs, N = 589, RR 0.77, CI 0.67 to 0.88). Participants receiving placebo were less likely to have a clinically significant improvement on Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) than those receiving risperidone (4 RCTs, N = 594, RR 0.69, CI 0.57 to 0.83,  very low‐quality evidence ). Overall, the risperidone group was 31% less likely to leave early compared to placebo group (12 RCTs, N = 2261, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.78,  low‐quality evidence ), but Incidence of significant extrapyramidal side effect was more likely to occur in the risperidone group (7 RCTs, N = 1511, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.15,  very low‐quality evidence ). When risperidone and placebo were augmented with clozapine, there is no significant differences between groups for clinical response as defined by a less than 20% reduction in PANSS/BPRS scores (2 RCTs, N = 98, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.42,  low‐quality evidence)  and attrition (leaving the study early for any reason) (3 RCTs, N = 167, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.42,  low quality evidence) . One study measured clinically significant responses using the CGI, no effect was evident (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 1.12 95% CI 0.87 to 1.44,  low quality evidence ). No data were available for extrapyramidal adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Based on low quality evidence, risperidone appears to be benefitial in improving mental state compared with placebo, but it also causes more adverse events. Eight out of the 15 included trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The currently available evidence is very low  to  low quality . Plain language summary Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia Review question Is risperidone (tablet form) more effective than placebo in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses? Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These are called ‘positive symptoms’. Mental illness also causes tiredness, apathy, emotional numbness, and withdrawal. These are called ‘negative symptoms’. The main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs can be classified into typical (older) and atypical (newer) drugs. Typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment for decades, and have been effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms, however, have been fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with unpleasant side effects that cause people to stop taking medication, which may lead to relapse. It is thought that newer atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are more effective than the older antipsychotics as they reduce the positive symptoms but cause fewer side effects. Study characteristics Searches for high‐quality randomised trials were carried out in 2008, 2013 and 2015. The review now includes 15 studies with 2428 participants. The studies randomised participants (in‐ and outpatients) with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses into treatment groups that received oral risperidone or placebo. Key results Results from limited data suggest that risperidone is more effective than placebo for reducing the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and participants receiving risperidone were more likely to comply with treatment. However, like the older typical antipsychotics, risperidone was also associated with serious side effects, such as parkinsonism. Quality of the evidence The evidence available was very low quality. Information and data were limited, poorly reported, and probably biased in favour of risperidone . Nearly half of the included trials were funded by drug companies. Firm conclusions are difficult to make based on the results of this review. Better conduct and reporting of trials could increase confidence in the results.

AB: Abstract - Background Peer support provides the opportunity for peers with experiential knowledge of a mental illness to give emotional, appraisal and informational assistance to current service users, and is becoming an important recovery‐oriented approach in healthcare for people with mental illness. Objectives To assess the effects of peer‐support interventions for people with schizophrenia or other serious mental disorders, compared to standard care or other supportive or psychosocial interventions not from peers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials on 27 July 2016 and 4 July 2017. There were no limitations regarding language, date, document type or publication status. Selection criteria We selected all randomised controlled clinical studies involving people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other related serious mental illness that compared peer support to standard care or other psychosocial interventions and that did not involve 'peer' individual/group(s). We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. Our primary outcomes were service use and global state (relapse). Data collection and analysis The authors of this review complied with the Cochrane recommended standard of conduct for data screening and collection. Two review authors independently screened the studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion until the authors reached a consensus. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary data, and the mean difference and its 95% CI for continuous data. We used a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. Main results This review included 13 studies with 2479 participants. All included studies compared peer support in addition to standard care with standard care alone. We had significant concern regarding risk of bias of included studies as over half had an unclear risk of bias for the majority of the risk domains (i.e. random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition and selective reporting). Additional concerns regarding blinding of participants and outcome assessment, attrition and selective reporting were especially serious, as about a quarter of the included studies were at high risk of bias for these domains. All included studies provided useable data for analyses but only two trials provided useable data for two of our main outcomes of interest, and there were no data for one of our primary outcomes, relapse. Peer support appeared to have little or no effect on hospital admission at medium term (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.75; participants = 19; studies = 1, very low‐quality evidence) or all‐cause death in the long term (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.31; participants = 555; studies = 1, very low‐quality evidence). There were no useable data for our other prespecified important outcomes: days in hospital, clinically important change in global state (improvement), clinically important change in quality of life for peer supporter and service user, or increased cost to society. One trial compared peer support with clinician‐led support but did not report any useable data for the above main outcomes. Authors' conclusions Currently, very limited data are available for the effects of peer support for people with schizophrenia. The risk of bias within trials is of concern and we were unable to use the majority of data reported in the included trials. In addition, the few that were available, were of very low quality. The current body of evidence is insufficient to either refute or support the use of peer‐support interventions for people with schizophrenia and other mental illness. Plain language summary Peer support for schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses Background Schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses are chronic disruptive mental disorders with disturbing psychotic, affective and cognitive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, insomnia, difficulty in concentration, suspiciousness and social withdrawal. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medicine, but these are not always fully effective. Peer support provides the opportunity for both a service user and a provider of care to share knowledge, direct experience of their illness and to help each other along the path to recovery. The support is given alongside antipsychotic treatment. Through interpersonal sharing, modelling and assistance within or outside of group sessions, it is believed that these supportive strategies can help combat feelings of hopelessness and behavioural problems that may result from having an illness and empower people to continue their treatment and help them to resume key roles in real life. However, findings from research have been inconsistent regarding the effectiveness of peer support for people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses. Review aims This review aimed to find high‐quality evidence from relevant randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) so we could assess the effects of peer‐support interventions for people with serious mental illness in comparison to standard care or other supportive or psychosocial interventions not from peers. We were interested in finding clinically meaningful data that could provide information regarding the effect peer support has on hospital admission, relapse, global state, quality of life, death and cost to society for people with schizophrenia. Searches We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of trials (up to 2017) and found 13 trials that randomised 2479 people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses to receive either peer support plus their standard care, clinician‐led support plus their standard care or standard care alone. Key results Thirteen trials were available but the evidence was very low quality. Useable data were reported for only two of our prespecified outcomes of importance and showed adding peer support to standard care appeared to have little or no clear impact on hospital admission or death for people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses. One of these trials (participants = 156) also compared peer support with clinician‐led support (where a health professional provided support). However, there were no useable data for this comparison reported for the main outcomes. Conclusions We have little confidence in the above findings. Currently, there is no high‐quality evidence available to either support or refute the effectiveness of peer‐support interventions for people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is frequently a chronic and disabling illness with a heterogeneous range of symptoms. The positive symptoms usually respond to antipsychotics but the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are difficult to treat with conventional antipsychotics and significantly impact on quality of life and social outcomes. Selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) increase prefrontal dopamine and noradrenaline levels without significantly affecting subcortical dopamine levels, making them an attractive candidate for treating cognitive and negative symptoms. Objectives To investigate the effects of selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), compared with a placebo or control treatment, for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (up to 7 February 2017) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitation for inclusion of records into the register. We inspected references of all included studies for further relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NRIs with either a control treatment or placebo for people with schizophrenia or related disorders (such as schizoaffective disorder) by any means of diagnosis. We included trials that met our selection criteria and provided useable information. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), and for cognitive outcomes we derived standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and using a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table which included our prespecified main outcomes of interest. Main results Searching identified 113 records. We obtained the full text of 48 of these records for closer inspection. Sixteen trials, randomising a total of 919 participants are included. The majority of trials included adults with schizophrenia or similar illness who were inpatients, and while they were poorly characterised, most appeared to include patients with a chronic presentation. The intervention NRI in nine of the 16 trials was reboxetine, with atomoxetine and viloxazine used in the remaining trials. 14 trials compared NRIs with placebo. Only two trials provided data to compare NRIs against an active control and both compared reboxetine to citalopram but at 4 weeks and 24 weeks respectively so they could not be combined in a meta‐analysis. One trial was described as 'open' and we considered it to be at high risk of bias for randomisation and blinding, three trials were at high risk of bias for attrition, six for reporting, and two for other sources of bias. Our main outcomes of interest were significant response or improvement in positive/negative mental state, global state and cognitive functioning, average cognitive functioning scores, significant response or improvement in quality of life and incidence of nausea. All data for main outcomes were short term. NRIs versus placebo Mental state results showed significantly greater rates of improvement in negative symptoms scores (1 RCT, n = 50; RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.52 to 6.58; very low quality evidence) with NRIs on the PANSS negative. No data were reported for significant response or improvement in positive symptoms, but average endpoint PANSS positive scores were available and showed no difference between NRIs and placebo (5 RCTs, n = 294; MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.96 to 0.63; low‐quality evidence). Improvement in clinical global status was similar between groups (1 RCT, n = 28; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.20; very low quality evidence). Significant response or improvement in cognitive functioning data were not reported. Average composite cognitive scores showed no difference between NRIs and placebo (4 RCTs, n = 180; SMD 0.04, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.36; low‐quality evidence). Significant response or improvement in quality of life data were not reported, however average endpoint scores from the GQOLI‐74 were reported. Those receiving NRIs had better quality of life scores compared to placebo (1 RCT, n = 114; MD 9.36, 95% CI 7.89 to 10.83; very low quality evidence). All‐cause withdrawals did not differ between the treatment groups (8 RCTs, n = 401, RR 0.94 95% CI 0.63 to 1.39; moderate‐quality evidence). Rates of nausea were not greater with NRIs (3 RCTs, n = 176; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.41; low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Our results provide tentative very low quality evidence that compared to placebo, NRIs (specifically reboxetine) may have a benefit on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Limited evidence also suggests that NRIs have no effect on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia or cognitive functioning. NRIs appear generally well tolerated with no real differences in adverse effects such as nausea noted between NRIs and placebo. However, these results are based on short‐term follow‐up and are poor quality — there is need for more good‐quality evidence. A large RCT of reboxetine over a longer period of time, focusing specifically on negative and cognitive symptoms as well as more detailed and comprehensive reporting of outcomes, including adverse events, is required. Plain language summary Using selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) to treat schizophrenia Review question Are selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) effective for treating the symptoms, particularly the negative symptoms, of schizophrenia? Background People with schizophrenia often have positive symptoms such as hearing voices (hallucinations), bizarre beliefs (delusions), or unclear thinking (formal thought disorder). These can be treated successfully with antipsychotic medication. People with schizophrenia also have negative symptoms such as social withdrawal or lack of motivation and cognitive symptoms such as difficulties making decisions and problems with attention or memory. Negative symptoms often are long term and reduce quality of life. Unlike the positive symptoms, there is a lack of effective medications to treat these negative symptoms. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (such as reboxetine or atomoxetine) are medicines that might help with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in particular. There have been trials investigating the effectiveness of NRIs for people with schizophrenia but results found NRIs had little benefit. However, these were very small studies. We wanted to see whether combining results from all these trials would provide better‐quality evidence. Searching and study characteristics The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their specialised register for relevant trials up to February 2017. We found sixteen trials that could be included. These trials randomised 919 adults with schizophrenia to receive either an NRI, a placebo (dummy treatment), or an antidepressant. All participants continued to receive the antipsychotic medications they were already taking. Most trials included participants who were in hospital and who had had symptoms of schizophrenia for a long time. Key results and quality of the evidence available Our main areas of interest were the effect NRIs have on improving mental and global state, cognitive functioning and quality of life for people with schizophrenia; and if NRIs cause unpleasant side‐effects such as nausea. We found that compared to placebo treatment, NRIs (reboxetine in particular) have an effect on improving negative symptoms. However, we did not find evidence that NRIs have an effect on improving positive symptoms, cognitive functioning or incidence of nausea. One trial reported a benefit of reboxetine on quality of life scores. Conclusions The results of our review should be viewed with caution as the quality of evidence available is very low due to the small size of studies and poor quality of the trials. In order to make firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of NRIs for people with schizophrenia we need larger and better quality trials of NRIs. These should be long term and look particularly at negative and cognitive symptoms as well as side‐effects.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second‐generation ("atypical") antipsychotics (SGAs) have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether and if so how much the effects of the various SGAs differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone differs from that of other SGAs. Objectives To evaluate the effects of risperidone compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods 1. Electronic searching   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 2. Reference searching   We inspected the references of all identified studies for more trials. 3. Personal contact   We contacted the first author of each included study for missing information. 4. Drug companies   We contacted the manufacturers of all atypical antipsychotics included for additional data. Selection criteria We included all randomised, blinded trials comparing oral risperidone with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 45 blinded RCTs with 7760 participants. The number of RCTs available for each comparison varied: four studies compared risperidone with amisulpride, two with aripiprazole, 11 with clozapine, 23 with olanzapine, eleven with quetiapine, two with sertindole, three with ziprasidone and none with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (46.9%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Furthermore, 60% were industry sponsored, which can be a source of bias. There were few significant differences in overall acceptability of treatment as measured by leaving the studies early. Risperidone was slightly less acceptable than olanzapine, and slightly more acceptable than ziprasidone in this regard. Risperidone improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) slightly less than olanzapine (15 RCTs, n = 2390, MD 1.94 CI 0.58 to 3.31), but slightly more than quetiapine (9 RCTs, n = 1953, MD ‐3.09 CI ‐5.16 to ‐1.01) and ziprasidone (3 RCTs, n = 1016, MD ‐3.91 CI ‐7.55 to ‐0.27). The comparisons with the other SGA drugs were equivocal. Risperidone was also less efficacious than olanzapine and clozapine in terms of leaving the studies early due to inefficacy, but more efficacious than ziprasidone in the same outcome. Risperidone produced somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects than a number of other SGAs (use of antiparkinson medication versus clozapine 6 RCTs, n = 304, RR 2.57 CI 1.47 to 4.48, NNH 6 CI 33 to 3; versus olanzapine 13 RCTs, n = 2599, RR 1.28 CI 1.06 to 1.55, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100; versus quetiapine 6 RCTs, n = 1715, RR 1.98 CI 1.16 to 3.39, NNH 20 CI 10 to 100; versus ziprasidone 2 RCTs, n = 822, RR 1.42 CI 1.03 to 1.96, NNH not estimable; parkinsonism versus sertindole 1 RCT, n = 321, RR 4.11 CI 1.44 to 11.73, NNH 14 CI 100 to 8). Risperidone also increased prolactin levels clearly more than all comparators, except for amisulpride and sertindole for which no data were available. Other adverse events were less consistently reported, but risperidone may well produce more weight gain and/or associated metabolic problems than amisulpride (weight gain: 3 RCTs, n = 585, MD 0.99 CI 0.37 to 1.61), aripiprazole (cholesterol increase: 1 RCT, n = 83, MD 22.30 CI 4.91 to 39.69) and ziprasidone (cholesterol increase 2 RCTs, n = 767, MD 8.58 CI 1.11 to 16.04) but less than clozapine (weight gain 3 RCTs n = 373, MD ‐3.30 CI ‐5.65 to ‐0.95), olanzapine (weight gain 13 RCTs, n = 2116, MD ‐2.61 CI ‐3.74 to ‐1.48), quetiapine (cholesterol increase: 5 RCTs, n = 1433, MD ‐8.49 CI ‐12. 23 to ‐4.75) and sertindole (weight gain: 2 RCTs, n = 328, MD ‐0.99 CI ‐1.86 to ‐0.12). It may be less sedating than clozapine and quetiapine, lengthen the QTc interval less than sertindole (QTc change: 2 RCTs, n = 495, MD ‐18.60 CI ‐22.37 to 14.83), produce fewer seizures than clozapine (2 RCTs, n = 354, RR 0.22 CI 0.07 to 0.70, NNT 14 CI 8 to 33) and less sexual dysfunction in men than sertindole (2 RCTs, n = 437, RR 0.34 CI 0.16 to 0.76, NNT 13 CI 8 to 33). Authors' conclusions Risperidone seems to produce somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects and clearly more prolactin increase than most other SGAs. It may also differ from other compounds in efficacy and in the occurrence of other adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic problems, cardiac effects, sedation and seizures. Nevertheless, the large proportion of participants leaving studies early and incomplete reporting of outcomes makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Further large trials, especially comparing risperidone with those other new drugs for which only a few RCTs are available, are needed. Plain language summary Risperidone versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review examines the effects of risperidone compared to other second‐generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 45 relevant studies with 7760 participants comparing risperidone with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole and ziprasidone. Comparisons of risperidone with zotepine are currently not available. Risperidone was somewhat more successful than quetiapine and ziprasidone, but somewhat less successful than clozapine and olanzapine. The main disadvantage of risperidone were more frequent movement disorders and more prolactin increase compared to most other SGA drugs.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic medication is considered the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and is generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling positive symptoms. However, long‐term antipsychotic exposure has been associated with a range of adverse effects, including extra‐pyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia and death. Intermittent drug techniques refers to the 'use of medication only during periods of incipient relapse or symptom exacerbation rather than continuously'. The aim is to reduce the risk of typical adverse effects of antipsychotics by 'reducing long‐term medication exposure for patients who are receiving maintenance treatment while limiting the risk of relapse', with a further goal of improving social functioning resulting from the reduction of antipsychotic‐induced side effects Objectives To review the effects of different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2012) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching relevant intermittent drug treatment articles and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance therapy for people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were relapse and hospitalisation. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. For non‐skewed continuous endpoint data extracted from valid scales, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups with a 95% CI. Where data displayed heterogeneity, these were analysed using a random‐effects model. Skewed data are presented in tables. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results Of 241 records retrieved by the search, 17 trials conducted between 1961 and 2011, involving 2252 participants with follow‐up from six weeks to two years, were included. Homogenous data demonstrated that instances of relapse were significantly higher in people receiving any intermittent drug treatment in the long term (n = 436, 7 RCTs, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.54,  moderate quality evidence ). Intermittent treatment was shown to be more effective than placebo, however, and demonstrated that significantly less people receiving intermittent antipsychotics experienced full relapse by medium term (n = 290, 2 RCTs, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58,  very low quality evidence ). Hospitalisation rates were higher for people receiving any intermittent drug treatment by long term (n = 626, 5 RCTs, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.06,  moderate quality evidence ). Results demonstrated little difference in instances of tardive dyskinesia in groups with any intermittent drug technique versus maintenance therapy, with equivocal results (displaying slight heterogeneity) at long term (n = 165, 4 RCTs, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.30,  low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Results of this review support the existing evidence that intermittent antipsychotic treatment is not as effective as continuous, maintained antipsychotic therapy in preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment regarding adverse effects typically associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment, as well as any cost‐effectiveness of this experimental treatment. Plain language summary Intermittent drug techniques for schizophrenia Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment for schizophrenia and helps people cope with positive symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, long‐term exposure to these drugs has been associated with serious side effects, such as: weight gain; uncontrollable shaking of the head, body or hands; tremors; muscle stiffness; difficulties with walking and balance; sleepiness or apathy; and even death. Some people stop taking their medication as these side effects limit people’s quality of life. Not taking medication can be a contributory factor that leads to relapse and hospitalisation. Against this backdrop, there is cause to consider the role of intermittently administering antipsychotic medication compared to the continuous use of antipsychotic medication. Intermittent drug techniques refer to the use of medication only during periods close to relapse of symptoms rather than continuously taking antipsychotic drugs all the time. Intermittent drug techniques include: prodrome‐based intervention (which assesses the risk or early stage of relapse); crisis intervention during an acute episode or downturn in mental health; gradually increased drug‐free periods; and drug holidays. The aim is to reduce exposure to drugs and decrease side effects. This review assesses different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Seventeen studies with 2252 participants compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance on medication. Relapse was significantly higher in people receiving intermittent drug treatment. Hospitalisation was higher for people receiving intermittent drug treatment. Results suggest that intermittent treatment is not as effective as continuous or maintained treatment in preventing relapse. Although information favours maintenance and continuous treatment, this is not always the case in real settings, where people may stop their medication due to debilitating side effects that affect their quality of life. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment, particularly regarding the side effects commonly associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment. There was no exploration of economic/money savings, specifically relating to the potential cost‐effectiveness of intermittent techniques. Until further evidence is available concerning the potential benefits or harms of intermittent treatment, managers, psychiatrists and policy makers should consider it an experimental therapy.

AB: Abstract - Background Acute psychotic illness, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome. Objectives To examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non‐pharmacological approaches. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results Twenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes. Benzodiazepines versus placebo One trial compared benzodiazepines with placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants sedated at 24 hours ( very low quality evidence ). However, for the outcome of global state, clearly more people receiving placebo showed no improvement in the medium term (one to 48 hours) (n = 102, 1 RCT, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97,  very low quality evidence ).    Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics When compared with haloperidol, there was no observed effect for benzodiazepines for sedation by 16 hours (n = 434, 8 RCTs, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.54, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who had not improved in the medium term (n = 188, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11,  low quality evidence ). However, one small study found fewer participants improved when receiving benzodiazepines compared with olanzapine (n = 150, 1 RCT, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.18,  very low quality evidence ). People receiving benzodiazepines were less likely to experience extrapyramidal effects in the medium term compared to people receiving haloperidol (n = 233, 6 RCTs, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41 , low quality evidence ). Benzodiazepines versus combined antipsychotics/antihistamines When benzodiazepine was compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (haloperidol plus promethazine), there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepines in the medium term (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.05,  low quality evidence ). However, for sedation, the results were controversial between two groups: lorazepam may lead to lower risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.98,  low quality evidence ); while, midazolam may lead to higher risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23,  low quality evidence ). Other combinations Data comparing benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus benzodiazepines alone did not yield any results with clear differences; all were very low quality evidence. When comparing combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics (all studies compared haloperidol) with the same antipsychotics alone (haloperidol), there was no difference between groups in improvement in the medium term (n = 185, 4 RCTs, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46,  low quality evidence ), but sedation was more likely in people who received the combination therapy (n = 172, 3 RCTs, RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.67, very low quality evidence ). Only one study compared combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotics with antipsychotics; however, this study did not report our primary outcomes. One small study compared combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics with combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. Results showed a higher risk of no clinical improvement (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 25.00, 95% CI 1.55 to 403.99,  very low quality evidence ) and sedation status (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 12.00, 95% CI 1.66 to 86.59,  very low quality evidence)  in the combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics group. Authors' conclusions The evidence from RCTs for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good. There were relatively few good data. Most trials were too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects. Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects. Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify. Much more high‐quality research is still needed in this area. Plain language summary Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs for acute psychosis Review question The aim of this review was to compare the tranquillising (calming) or sedative (sleepiness) effects of benzodiazepines, given alone or combined with other drugs compared with the effect of placebo (a pretend treatment), other drugs or non‐drug treatments for people who are aggressive or agitated because they are experiencing psychoses. Background Acute psychosis is a rapid worsening of a person’s mental state where touch with reality is often lost. People may experience frightening delusions or hallucinations which are distressing and may cause agitated or aggressive behaviour. In urgent cases, this agitation or aggression may cause harm to the person experiencing the psychoses or others around them. To avoid such harm, rapid tranquillisation or sedation with medicines may be required. The most common medicines used to achieve a state of calmness or sedation are benzodiazepines and these can be given either alone or in combination with antipsychotics. Searching The original search for this review was carried out in January 2012 and subsequently two further update searches were run in August 2015 and August 2016. In total, these searches found 2497 records, which the review authors checked for inclusion or exclusion from the review. Authors included records only if they were randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that allocated people with acute psychosis who presented with agitation, violence aggressive behaviour (or a combination of these) to receive benzodiazepines either given alone or combined with any antipsychotics, versus placebo, antipsychotics alone or in combination with other antipsychotics/benzodiazepines/antihistamines or non‐drug treatments. Evidence found In total, 20 trials were included. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low due to serious risk of bias and very small size of included trials. There was no clear difference in improvement between benzodiazepines and placebo, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics or benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics and benzodiazepines alone or antipsychotic alone. When benzodiazepines were compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines, there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepine alone but the evidence was of low quality. Only one study showed lower effect of combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics versus combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. However, the evidence was of very low quality. In terms of side effects, people receiving benzodiazepines compared to antipsychotics had lower risk of presenting with symptoms such as shaking, tremors and slurred speech whereas the results for the sedation caused were unclear. Conclusions The existing trials are not informative enough to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines alone or in additional to other medicines when urgent tranquillisation or sedation with medicines is required. Although benzodiazepines alone may cause fewer side effects compared to older antipsychotics, when they are added on to other medicines this may lead to unnecessary side effects. Further studies are needed to provide good‐quality evidence with robust conclusions to inform clinical practice and policies around rapid tranquillisation for people with psychoses who are aggressive or agitated.

Objectives To review evidence concerning short‐ and long‐term advantages and disadvantages of combined psychotherapy plus antidepressant treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with either therapy alone. Search methods The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched on 11/10/2005, together with a complementary search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, using the keywords antidepressant and panic. A reference search, SciSearch and personal contact with experts were carried out. Selection criteria Two independent review authors identified randomised controlled trials comparing the combined therapy against either of the monotherapies among adult patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors extracted data using predefined data formats, including study quality indicators. The primary outcome was relative risk (RR) of "response" i.e. substantial overall improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators. Secondary outcomes included standardised weighted mean differences in global severity, panic attack frequency, phobic avoidance, general anxiety, depression and social functioning and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Main results We identified 23 randomised comparisons (representing 21 trials, 1709 patients), 21 of which involved behaviour or cognitive‐behaviour therapies. In the acute phase treatment, the combined therapy was superior to antidepressant pharmacotherapy (RR 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.52) or psychotherapy (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31). The combined therapy produced more dropouts due to side effects than psychotherapy (number needed to harm (NNH) around 26). After the acute phase treatment, as long as the drug was continued, the superiority of the combination over either monotherapy appeared to persist. After termination of the acute phase and continuation treatment, the combined therapy was more effective than pharmacotherapy alone (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.11) and was as effective as psychotherapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16). Authors' conclusions Either combined therapy or psychotherapy alone may be chosen as first line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, depending on patient preference. Plain language summary Psychotherapy combined with antidepressants for panic disorder Psychotherapy plus antidepressant treatment were compared with each of the two individual treatments alone for panic disorder. At the end of the acute phase treatment, the combined therapy was superior to psychotherapy or antidepressant treatment alone. After termination of active treatment, the combined therapy was superior to antidepressants alone and was as effective as psychotherapy alone. Either combined therapy or psychotherapy alone may be chosen as first line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, depending on patient preference.

AB: Abstract - Background Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication is used extensively to treat people with chronic mental illnesses. Its use, however, is associated with adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) ‐ a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements around the mouth and face. This review, one in a series examining the treatment of TD, covers miscellaneous treatments not covered elsewhere. Objectives To determine whether drugs, hormone‐, dietary‐, or herb‐supplements not covered in other Cochrane reviews on TD treatments, surgical interventions, electroconvulsive therapy, and mind‐body therapies were effective and safe for people with antipsychotic‐induced TD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials including trial registers (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) dealing with people with antipsychotic‐induced TD and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who remained on their antipsychotic medication and had been randomly allocated to the interventions listed above versus placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included 31 RCTs of 24 interventions with 1278 participants; 22 of these trials were newly included in this 2017 update. Five trials are awaiting classification and seven trials are ongoing. All participants were adults with chronic psychiatric disorders, mostly schizophrenia, and antipsychotic‐induced TD. Studies were primarily of short (three to six6 weeks) duration with small samples size (10 to 157 participants), and most (61%) were published more than 20 years ago. The overall risk of bias in these studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting of allocation concealment, generation of the sequence, and blinding. Nineteen of the 31 included studies reported on the primary outcome 'No clinically important improvement in TD symptoms'. Two studies found moderate‐quality evidence of a benefit of the intervention compared with placebo: valbenazine (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.86, 1 RCT, n = 92) and extract of  Ginkgo biloba  (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96, 1 RCT, n = 157), respectively. However, due to small sample sizes we cannot be certain of these effects. We consider the results for the remaining interventions to be inconclusive: Low‐ to very low‐quality evidence of a benefit was found for buspirone (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84, 1 RCT, n = 42), dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.97, 1 RCT, n = 28), hypnosis or relaxation, (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.94, 1 study, n = 15), pemoline (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.77, 1 RCT, n = 46), promethazine (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55, 1 RCT, n = 34), insulin (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96, 1 RCT, n = 20), branched chain amino acids (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00, 1 RCT, n = 52), and isocarboxazid (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.71, 1 RCT, n = 20). There was low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence of no difference between intervention and placebo or no treatment for the following interventions: melatonin (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.12, 2 RCTs, n = 32), lithium (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.23, 1 RCT, n = 11), ritanserin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.43, 1 RCT, n = 10), selegiline (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94, 1 RCT, n = 33), oestrogen (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.83, 1 RCT, n = 12), and gamma‐linolenic acid (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.45, 1 RCT, n = 16). None of the included studies reported on the other primary outcome, 'no clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects'. Authors' conclusions This review has found that the use of valbenazine or extract of  Ginkgo biloba  may be effective in relieving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. However, since only one RCT has investigated each one of these compounds, we are awaiting results from ongoing trials to confirm these results. Results for the remaining interventions covered in this review must be considered inconclusive and these compounds probably should only be used within the context of a well‐designed evaluative study. Plain language summary Miscellaneous treatments for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if drugs, supplements, surgical interventions, electroconvulsive therapy, or mind‐body therapies not covered in other Cochrane reviews of tardive dyskinesia can improve tardive dyskinesia. We collected and analysed all relevant randomised controlled trials to answer this question. Key messages The drug valbenazine and extract of the herb  Ginkgo biloba  probably improves symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. But we still need more high‐quality studies to confirm these findings that were taken from only one study per intervention. What was studied in the review? Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia by controlling, for instance, abnormal perceptions (hallucinations), disordered thinking and fixed false beliefs (delusions). Tardive dyskinesia is a disfiguring and disabling disorder of abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements, and it is often caused by antipsychotic drugs. More than 20% of people who rely on antipsychotic drugs to control their mental illness have developed tardive dyskinesia. Many different interventions have been studied for easing the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Several Cochrane reviews have summarised the effects of the many treatments used to manage these involuntary movements. This review focusses on 'miscellaneous', a group of other non‐connected, interventions not covered in the other Cochrane reviews on tardive dyskinesia. What are the main results of the review? We found 31 studies that reported on 24 different interventions to improve tardive dyskinesia in 1278 people who take antipsychotic medication for their chronic mental illnesses. Unfortunately most studies followed up on participants for a short time (most were three to six weeks) and included few participants (the average number of participants was 41 per study). • Valbenazine probably reduces symptoms of tardive dyskinesia to a clinically important extent compared with placebo (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, this evidence is based on only one study in the USA with 92 participants; we are awaiting results from recently completed and ongoing trials to confirm these results. • Extract of  Ginkgo biloba  probably reduces symptoms of tardive dyskinesia to a clinically important extent compared with placebo (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, this evidence is based on only one study in China with 157 participants; we are awaiting results from recently completed and ongoing trials to confirm these results. • Evidence for the remaining interventions was of low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence and we consider the results for these other interventions to be inconclusive. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to 26 April 2017.

AB: Abstract - Background Bipolar disorder is a common condition associated with high morbidity; developing efficacious, safe treatments is therefore essential. Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. It acts as mood stabiliser and reduces the risk of suicide. However, evidence assessing the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania is less robust. Current evidence‐based guidelines cite multiple anti‐dopaminergic and mood‐stabilising agents as initial treatments: more definite evidence is needed to decide if lithium should be the first‐line therapy. Objectives 1. To assess the effects of lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.  2. To review the acceptability and tolerability of treatment with lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatments in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have incorporated studies from searches to 18 May 2018 into the current analyses. Selection criteria Prospective randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo or alternative drug treatment in treatment of acute mania. We included anyone with bipolar disorder, male and female, of any age. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used odds ratios (ORs) to analyse binary efficacy outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuously distributed outcomes. We used a fixed‐effect model unless heterogeneity was moderate or substantial, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse data. We assessed the certainty of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results We found 36 randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo, one of 12 drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of acute mania. Studies included male and female participants (n = 4220), of all ages, who all fitted criteria for a manic episode within the context of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Risk of bias was variable; 12 studies had a high risk of bias in one domain and 27 gave inadequate information on randomisation leading to an 'unclear' rating for selection bias. Lithium versus placebo High‐certainty evidence found that lithium was an effective treatment for acute mania and was more effective than placebo at inducing a response (OR 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 2.63; participants = 1707; studies = 6; I 2  = 16%; high‐certainty evidence), or remission (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.69; participants = 1597; studies = 5; I 2  = 21%; high‐certainty evidence). Lithium was more likely than placebo to cause tremor (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.04; participants = 1241; studies = 6; I 2  = 0%; high‐certainty evidence), and somnolence (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.58; participants = 1351; studies = 7; I 2  = 0%; high‐certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lithium for all‐cause dropouts (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; participants = 1353; studies = 7; I 2  = 75%; moderate‐certainty evidence), and weight gain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.92; participants = 735, studies = 3; I 2 = 51%; moderate‐certainty evidence). Lithium versus antipsychotics or mood stabilisers For the outcome of inducing a response, there was only very low‐certainty evidence regarding lithium compared to haloperidol (MD −2.40, 95% CI −6.31 to 1.50; participants = 80; studies = 3; I 2  = 95%), quetiapine (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.55; participants = 335; studies = 2; I 2  = 71%), and carbamazepine (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.60; participants = 102; studies = 3; I 2  = 0%). Lithium was probably less likely to induce a response than olanzapine (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; participants = 180; studies = 2; I 2  = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence). Lithium may be less likely to induce a response than risperidone (MD 7.28, 95% CI 5.22 to 9.34; participants = 241; studies = 3; I 2  = 49%; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between lithium and valproate (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.70; participants = 607; studies = 5; I 2  = 22%; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was moderate‐certainty evidence that lithium was more effective than topiramate at treating acute mania (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.20; participants = 660; studies = 1). Data on adverse events for these comparisons contained too few studies to provide high‐certainty evidence. Authors' conclusions This systematic review indicates that lithium is more effective than placebo as a treatment for acute mania but increases the risk for somnolence and tremor. Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers (valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol). Olanzapine may be an exception, as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium. There is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium. Lithium is probably more effective at treating acute mania than topiramate. When compared to placebo, lithium was more likely to cause adverse events. However, when compared to other drugs, too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high‐certainty evidence. More, rigorously designed, large‐scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if lithium is superior to other interventions in treating acute mania. Plain language summary Lithium for the treatment of acute mania Review question Is lithium (a mood‐stabilising medication) as effective at treating an episode of mania (high mood) as other available drug treatments or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)? Background Bipolar disorder is a common condition in which people experience episodes of low mood (depression) and high mood (mania). The symptoms of bipolar disorder may lower quality of life. Traditionally a range of medications have been used to treat mania, including medications that try to lessen changes in mood (e.g. lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, divalproex, topiramate), and those that reduce distressing experiences, such as hearing voices or having unusual ideas (e.g. olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, chlorpromazine). ECT (delivering an electric shock to the brain whilst the patient is under a general anaesthetic) is also a treatment for mania. We already know that lithium is the most effective of all these treatments for keeping people with bipolar disorder well in the long term, but we do not know if it is as effective for treating mania. Method The review authors searched for studies comparing lithium to other treatments for mania published up to May 2018. We identified 36 randomised studies, including 4220 participants who attended hospitals in at least 30 different countries. Randomisation means that each participant has the same chance of being assigned to each of the study groups, and reduces the chance that unknown but important factors could influence the study accidentally. Three studies included children and adolescents aged under 18 years. The studies compared lithium to placebo (inactive substance), ECT and 12 other medications for between three and 12 weeks. Results Lithium is an effective treatment for acute mania. Lithium was more effective than a placebo or the anti‐epileptic drug topiramate. There was some evidence that lithium may be less effective than the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, but this needs further investigation. There was no evidence that lithium was better or worse at treating mania than any of the other drugs, and not enough evidence to draw a conclusion for ECT. There was not enough evidence to provide a definite answer as to which treatment for mania has the fewest side effects. It is probable that more people will develop a mild tremor when treated with lithium than other treatments. Participants were not more likely to withdraw from a study if they were treated with lithium compared to another treatment. Unanswered questions remain, and these would be best resolved by further large, well‐designed studies comparing lithium to other treatments for acute mania.

AB: Abstract - Background Risperidone is the first new generation antipsychotic drug made available in a long‐acting injection formulation. Objectives To examine the effects of depot risperidone for treatment of schizophrenia or related psychoses in comparison with placebo, no treatment or other antipsychotic medication. To critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the resource use, cost and cost‐effectiveness of risperidone (depot) for schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2002, 2012, and October 28, 2015). We also checked the references of all included studies, and contacted industry and authors of included studies. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing depot risperidone with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results Twelve studies, with a total of 5723 participants were randomised to the following comparison treatments: Risperidone depot versus placebo Outcomes of relapse and improvement in mental state were neither measured or reported. In terms of other primary outcomes, more people receiving placebo left the study early by 12 weeks (1 RCT, n=400, RR 0.74 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88,  very low quality evidence ), experienced severe adverse events in short term (1 RCT, n=400, RR 0.59 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93,  very low quality evidence ). There was however, no difference in levels of weight gain between groups (1 RCT, n=400, RR 2.11 95% CI 0.48 to 9.18,  very low quality evidence ). Risperidone depot versus general oral antipsychotics The outcome of improvement in mental state was not presented due to high levels of attrition, nor were levels of severe adverse events explicitly reported. Most primary outcomes of interest showed no difference between treatment groups. However, more people receiving depot risperidone experienced nervous system disorders (long‐term:1 RCT, n=369, RR 1.34 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58,  very‐low quality evidence ). Risperidone depot versus oral risperidone Data for relapse and severe adverse events were not reported. All outcomes of interest were rated as  moderate quality evidence . Main results showed no differences between treatment groups with equivocal data for change in mental state, numbers leaving the study early, any extrapyramidal symptoms, weight increase and prolactin‐related adverse events. Risperidone depot versus oral quetiapine Relapse rates and improvement in mental state were not reported. Fewer people receiving risperidone depot left the study early (long‐term: 1 RCT, n=666, RR 0.84 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95,  moderate quality evidence ). Experience of serious adverse events was similar between groups ( low quality evidence ), but more people receiving depot risperidone experienced EPS (1 RCT, n=666, RR 1.83 95% CI 1.07 to 3.15,  low quality evidence ), had greater weight gain (1 RCT, n=666, RR 1.25 95% CI 0.25 to 2.25,  low quality evidence ) and more prolactin‐related adverse events (1 RCT, n=666, RR 3.07 95% CI 1.13 to 8.36 , very low quality evidence ). Risperidone depot versus oral aripiprazole Relapse rates, mental state using PANSS, leaving the study early, serious adverse events and weight increase were similar between groups. However more people receiving depot risperidone experienced prolactin‐related adverse events compared to those receiving oral aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=729, RR 9.91 95% CI 2.78 to 35.29,  very low quality of evidence ). Risperidone depot versus oral olanzapine Relapse rates were not reported in any of the included studies for this comparison. Improvement in mental state using PANSS and instances of severe adverse events were similar between groups. More people receiving depot risperidone left the study early than those receiving oral olanzapine (1 RCT, n=618, RR 1.32 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58,  low quality evidence ) with those receiving risperidone depot also experiencing more extrapyramidal symptoms (1 RCT, n=547, RR 1.67 95% CI 1.19 to 2.36,  low quality evidence ). However, more people receiving oral olanzapine experienced weight increase (1 RCT, n=547, RR 0.56 95% CI 0.42 to 0.75,  low quality evidence ). Risperidone depot versus atypical depot antipsychotics (specifically paliperidone palmitate) Relapse rates were not reported and rates of response using PANSS, weight increase, prolactin‐related adverse events and glucose‐related adverse events were similar between groups. Fewer people left the study early due to lack of efficacy from the risperidone depot group (long term: 1 RCT, n=749, RR 0.60 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81,  low quality evidence ), but more people receiving depot risperidone required use of EPS‐medication (2 RCTs, n=1666, RR 1.46 95% CI 1.18 to 1.8,  moderate quality evidence ). Risperidone depot versus typical depot antipsychotics Outcomes of relapse, severe adverse events or movement disorders were not reported. Outcomes relating to improvement in mental state demonstrated no difference between groups ( low quality evidence ). However, more people receiving depot risperidone compared to other typical depots left the study early (long‐term:1 RCT, n=62, RR 3.05 95% CI 1.12 to 8.31,  low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions Depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term. In people who are happy to take oral medication the depot risperidone is approximately equal to oral risperidone. It is possible that the depot formulation, however, can bring a second‐generation antipsychotic to people who do not reliably adhere to treatment. People with schizophrenia who have difficulty adhering to treatment, however, are unlikely to volunteer for a clinical trial. Such people may gain benefit from the depot risperidone with no increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects. Plain language summary Long‐acting preparation of risperidone for schizophrenia Review question Risperidone is a newer antipsychotic drug that was the first available as a long‐lasting injection (a depot injection). The review examines the clinical effects of depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia. Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). People can also become withdrawn, socially isolated, tired and apathetic. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, uncontrollable shaking, tremors, spasms and tiredness. These side effects often mean that people stop taking their medication (non‐ compliance), which may lead to relapse. Study characteristics The review was updated in 2015 and includes 12 studies with 5723 people who received risperidone depot or a range of other treatments (placebo, general oral antipsychotics, oral risperidone, oral quetiapine, oral aripiprazole, oral olanzapine, atypical/newer depot antipsychotics, older depot antipsychotics). Key results It is difficult to know from the results of this review if depot risperidone is any more effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia than placebo or other treatments. For people who are happy to take oral medication, depot risperidone is about equal to oral risperidone. People on oral risperidone may continue to benefit if treated with depot risperidone, without the need to take tablets. However, in high doses, depot risperidone can have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, uncontrollable shaking, spasms and tremors. Depot risperidone may bring this new antipsychotic to people who stop taking their tablets, so helping reduce relapse and with little increased risk of side effects. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence presented is, in the main, low and at best moderate. There is the need for large, long‐term and well reported trials on depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia. Depot injections are often used on people who refuse treatment. Such people are difficult to include in studies. Written by a consumer, Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation.  http://mcpin.org/
