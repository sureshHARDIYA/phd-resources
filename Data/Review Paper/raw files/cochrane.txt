AB: Abstract - Background A particularly difficult challenge for community treatment of people with serious mental illnesses is the delivery of an acceptable level of care during the acute phases of severe mental illness. Crisis‐intervention models of care were developed as a possible solution. Objectives To review the effects of crisis‐intervention models for anyone with serious mental illness experiencing an acute episode compared to the standard care they would normally receive. If possible, to compare the effects of mobile crisis teams visiting patients' homes with crisis units based in home‐like residential houses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials. There is no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. This search was undertaken in 1998 and then updated 2003, 2006, 2010 and September 29, 2014. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials of crisis‐intervention models versus standard care for people with severe mental illnesses that met our inclusion criteria. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results The update search September 2014 found no further new studies for inclusion, the number of studies included in this review remains eight with a total of 1144 participants. Our main outcomes of interest are hospital use, global state, mental state, quality of life, participant satisfaction and family burden. With the exception of mental state, it was not possible to pool data for these outcomes. Crisis intervention may reduce repeat admissions to hospital (excluding index admissions) at six months (1 RCT, n = 369, RR 0.75 CI 0.50 to 1.13,  high quality evidence ), but does appear to reduce family burden (at six months: 1 RCT, n = 120, RR 0.34 CI 0.20 to 0.59,  low quality evidence ), improve mental state (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) three months: 2 RCTs, n = 248, MD ‐4.03 CI ‐8.18 to 0.12,  low quality evidence ), and improve global state (Global Assessment Scale (GAS) 20 months; 1 RCT, n = 142, MD 5.70, ‐0.26 to 11.66,  moderate quality evidence ). Participants in the crisis‐intervention group were more satisfied with their care 20 months after crisis (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‐8): 1 RCT, n = 137, MD 5.40 CI 3.91 to 6.89,  moderate quality evidence ). However, quality of life scores at six months were similar between treatment groups (Manchester Short Assessment of quality of life (MANSA); 1 RCT, n = 226, MD ‐1.50 CI ‐5.15 to 2.15,  low quality evidence ). Favourable results for crisis intervention were also found for leaving the study early and family satisfaction. No differences in death rates were found. Some studies suggested crisis intervention to be more cost‐effective than hospital care but all numerical data were either skewed or unusable. We identified no data on staff satisfaction, carer input, complications with medication or number of relapses. Authors' conclusions Care based on crisis‐intervention principles, with or without an ongoing homecare package, appears to be a viable and acceptable way of treating people with serious mental illnesses. However only eight small studies with unclear blinding, reporting and attrition bias could be included and evidence for the main outcomes of interest is low to moderate quality. If this approach is to be widely implemented it would seem that more evaluative studies are still needed. Plain language summary Crisis intervention for people with severe mental illnesses The move from hospital to community‐based care can be a frightening and difficult experience for people with severe mental illness (SMI). People with mental health problems may not have networks of support such as family, friends and carers. They often have no one they know personally to help them when they go home. To complicate matters, people with SMI can have critical downturns in their mental health creating a revolving‐door of care, where service users are discharged from hospital when considered stable and well, only to go back into hospital again when their mental health becomes worse during an acute episode or crisis. Crisis‐intervention and homecare packages have been developed as a possible solution to these problems. Crisis care, where support is provided during a crisis for service users, either in their home or a community setting, was found by this review to provide a package of support that was worthwhile, acceptable and less expensive than standard care. Furthermore, crisis care avoided repeat admission to hospital; improved the mental state of services users more than standard care; was more acceptable and satisfactory to service users and placed less burden on families and carers. There were no differences in death rates between crisis intervention and standard care. The review, however, looks at only eight studies. The methods of most of these studies were considered poor and there was no definitive description of crisis intervention or crisis care for studies included before 2006, meaning there was a lack of focus on crisis care in its pure form. Most studies excluded service users with alcohol or drug misuse, and those who were a danger of being harmful to themselves or others. The authors of the review suggest more studies are needed to create a stronger evidence base. Crisis care may be currently delivered without sound and good quality evidence. For example, no data or information were available on carer input, concordance or the willingness of service users to take medication and the number of relapses experienced by service users. Finally, despite reports of staff 'burn‐out', staff satisfaction with crisis care was not assessed.

AB: Abstract - Background The sustained interest in electronic assistive technology in dementia care has been fuelled by the urgent need to develop useful approaches to help support people with dementia at home. Also the low costs and wide availability of electronic devices make it more feasible to use electronic devices for the benefit of disabled persons. Information Communication Technology (ICT) devices designed to support people with dementia are usually referred to as Assistive Technology (AT) or Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT). By using AT in this review we refer to electronic assistive devices. A range of AT devices has been developed to support people with dementia and their carers to manage their daily activities and to enhance safety, for example electronic pill boxes, picture phones, or mobile tracking devices. Many are commercially available. However, the usefulness and user‐friendliness of these devices are often poorly evaluated. Although reviews of (electronic) memory aids do exist, a systematic review of studies focusing on the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia is lacking. Such a review would guide people with dementia and their informal and professional carers in selecting appropriate AT devices. Objectives Primary objective To assess the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia in terms of daily performance of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), level of dependency, and admission to long‐term care. Secondary objective To assess the impact of AT on: users (autonomy, usefulness and user‐friendliness, adoption of AT); cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms; need for informal and formal care; perceived quality of life; informal carer burden, self‐esteem and feelings of competence; formal carer work satisfaction, workload and feelings of competence; and adverse events. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), on 10 November 2016. ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists of the CDCIG and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and cognitive enhancement in healthy people. We also searched the following list of databases, adapting the search strategy as necessary: Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, up to May 2016; The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies; DBLP Computer Science Bibliography; HCI Bibliography: Human‐Computer Interaction Resources; and AgeInfo, all to June 2016; PiCarta; Inspec; Springer Link Lecture Notes; Social Care Online; and IEEE Computer Society Digital Library, all to October 2016; J‐STAGE: Japan Science and Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic; and Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (NCSTRL), both to November 2016; Computing Research Repository (CoRR) up to December 2016; and OT seeker; and ADEAR, both to February 2017. In addition, we searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE for grey literature. Selection criteria We intended to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clustered randomised trials with blinded assessment of outcomes that evaluated an electronic assistive device used with the single aim of supporting memory function in people diagnosed with dementia. The control interventions could either be 'care (or treatment) as usual' or non‐technological psychosocial interventions (including interventions that use non‐electronic assistive devices) also specifically aimed at supporting memory. Outcome measures included activities of daily living, level of dependency, clinical and care‐related outcomes (for example admission to long‐term care), perceived quality of life and well‐being, and adverse events resulting from the use of AT; as well as the effects of AT on carers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts identified by the search. Main results We identified no studies which met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the current lack of high‐quality evidence to determine whether AT is effective in supporting people with dementia to manage their memory problems. Plain language summary Assistive technology for memory support in dementia Review question We wanted to find out from a review of the evidence whether Assistive Technology can help people with dementia overcome some of the effects of their memory problems. Background Dementia causes memory problems that make it increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities, for example cooking, remembering appointments, taking medication. The memory problems experienced can have a large negative impact on people with dementia, and may cause confusion, anxiety, embarrassment, or depression. This decreasing ability to carry out daily activities can cause stress to family carers who worry about the person’s safety and well‐being. A range of electronic devices — most commonly referred to as Assistive Technology (AT – used throughout this review), and sometimes as Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT) — have been developed to support people with dementia. The devices can be divided into four categories offering support with general and personal information (e.g. digital social charts); practical support with problems caused by the symptoms of dementia, especially memory loss (e.g. electronic pill dispenser boxes, electronic diaries); support with social contact and company (e.g. picture phones, interactive ‘pet’ robots); and support with perceived risks to health and safety (e.g. tracking devices, fall sensors). In this review, we concentrated on devices intended to help people manage their memory problems. We wanted to find our whether AT is effective at helping people who have memory problems due to dementia carry out their daily activities, and whether it makes them less dependent on others, improves their quality of life or has an effect on admission to institutional care. We also wanted to find out if it has any impact on family and paid carers. Study characteristics We searched systematically for all research studies that had evaluated AT by allocating people with dementia at random to an AT device or to 'usual care' or a non‐technological solution to support memory and then comparing outcomes. Our search included all the evidence available up to 10 November 2016. Key results We found no studies that met our criteria. Quality of the evidence The review identified a lot of literature on the development of AT, including reports of researchers working with people with dementia and their carers to determine the type and design of AT which might be useful. There was also a lot of guidance written for health professionals and potential users of AT. We found some small studies that had tested the effectiveness of selected AT devices, but the methods used were not of a high enough quality to meet the review criteria. Therefore we cannot be sure at the moment whether or not AT can really help people with dementia manage their memory problems. We believe more research should be done in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Pharmacological treatments are the principal intervention for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to control symptoms and maintain psychosocial functioning. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions may help to improve the patient's condition and the course of the illness. Family interventions are deserving of special attention, since they may help to relieve the burden of care borne by relatives and caregivers, which in turn may facilitate the task of supporting the patient. Objectives The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of family interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder compared with no intervention and other forms of intervention. Search methods We searched the electronic databases CCDANRCT‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References on 1/8/2007, CENTRAL (2006‐3), MEDLINE (2006), EMBASE (2006) and LILACS (2006), and searched the reference lists of included studies. We also made personal contact with authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. Participants were people with bipolar disorder and their relatives or caregivers; family psychosocial interventions of any type were considered; primary outcomes were changes in the status of symptoms and relapse rates. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Quality assessment of included studies was carried out. The findings were presented descriptively. Where there were sufficient studies, dichotomous data were combined using relative risk, and continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference, with their 95% CIs. Main results Seven RCTs were included in the review, involving a total of 393 participants. All of the included studies assessed psychoeducational methods, and one study also assessed a type of systems psychotherapy. In all trials, participants continued to receive pharmacotherapy treatment. Due to the diversity of interventions, outcome measures and endpoints used across studies, it was not possible to perform meta‐analyses for primary outcomes. Five studies compared a variety of family interventions, involving carers, families or spouses, against no intervention, with individual findings indicating no significant added effect for family interventions. Three studies compared one type or modality of family intervention against another family intervention, with inconsistent findings. Authors' conclusions To date there is only a small and heterogeneous body of evidence on the effectiveness of family oriented approaches for bipolar disorder, and it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions to support their use as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. Further well designed RCTs should be a research priority. Plain language summary Family interventions for bipolar disorder Drug treatments are the primary treatment for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to manage the disorder. Studies on psychosocial interventions for mental disorders such as schizophrenia and anxiety show that they are effective treatments. Reports in the literature suggest that they may be useful for people with bipolar disorder as well. The role of the family is important in the care of people with bipolar disorder, with effective family functioning helping to maintain a person's psychological balance. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of any psychosocial family intervention for people with bipolar disorder and/or their families and carers. Seven randomised controlled trials (393 participants) were included in the review, all of which evaluated psychoeducational interventions. Five studies compared family interventions against no treatment, and three studies compared one type or delivery of family intervention against another family intervention. Differences in the interventions, outcome measures and end points used in the trials did not allow us to perform a meta‐analysis. Whilst results from individual studies did not suggest a significant effect for family interventions when added to drug therapy, the studies provide insufficient evidence to draw conclusions which can be generalised to everyday practice. Further research using appropriate randomised controlled trial methodology and evaluating family interventions other than psychoeducation is called for in this under‐researched and important topic.

AB: Abstract - Background Over approximately the last fifteen years, early psychological interventions, such as psychological 'debriefing', have been increasingly used following psychological trauma. Whilst this intervention has become popular and its use has spread to several settings, empirical evidence for its efficacy is noticeably lacking. This is the third update of a review of single session psychological "debriefing", first having been undertaken in 1997. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of brief psychological debriefing for the management of psychological distress after trauma, and the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder. Search methods Electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, PILOTS, Biosis, Pascal, Occ.Safety and Health,SOCIOFILE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, PSYNDEX, SIGLE, LILACS, CCTR, CINAHL, NRR, Hand search of Journal of Traumatic Stress. Contact with leading researchers. Selection criteria The focus of RCTs was on persons recently (one month or less) exposed to a traumatic event. The intervention consisted of a single session only, and involved some form of emotional processing/ventilation, by encouraging recollection/reworking of the traumatic event, accompanied by normalisation of emotional reaction to the event. Data collection and analysis 15 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable, but the majority of trials scored poorly. Data from 6 trials could not be included the meta‐analyses. These trials are summarised in the text. Main results Single session individual debriefing did not prevent the onset of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nor reduce psychological distress, compared to control. At one year, one trial reported a significantly increased risk of PTSD in those receiving debriefing (OR 2.51 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.09). Those receiving the intervention reported no reduction in PTSD severity at 1‐4 months (SMD 0.11 (95%CI 0.10 to 0.32)), 6‐13 months (SMD 0.26 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.50)), or 3 years (SMD 0.17 (95%CI ‐0.34 to 0.67)). There was also no evidence that debriefing reduced general psychological morbidity, depression or anxiety, or that it was superior to an educational intervention. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence that single session individual psychological debriefing is a useful treatment for the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder after traumatic incidents. Compulsory debriefing of victims of trauma should cease. A more appropriate response could involve a 'screen and treat' model (NICE 2005). Plain language summary Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) This review concerns the efficacy of single session psychological "debriefing" in reducing psychological distress and preventing the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events. Psychological debriefing is either equivalent to, or worse than, control or educational interventions in preventing or reducing the severity of PTSD, depression, anxiety and general psychological morbidity. There is some suggestion that it may increase the risk of PTSD and depression. The routine use of single session debriefing given to non selected trauma victims is not supported. No evidence has been found that this procedure is effective.

AB: Abstract - Background Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury) is common, often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self‐harm. Objectives To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. Data collection and analysis We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. Main results We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive‐behavioural‐based psychotherapy (CBT‐based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive‐behavioural, problem‐solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion‐regulation group‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality. There was a significant treatment effect for CBT‐based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow‐up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.26; k  =  6; N  =  594; GRADE: low quality). For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow‐up (MD ‐18.82, 95% CI ‐36.68 to ‐0.95; k  =  3; N  =  292; GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT‐oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow‐up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k  =  1; N  =  97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k  =  1; N  = 18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH. Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k  =  1; N  =  136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k  =  1; N  =  391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact‐based interventions) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k  =  4; N  =  3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k  =  2; N  =  1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N  =  840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone‐based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero cell counts; GRADE: low quality). None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of psychological therapy: interpersonal problem‐solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home‐based problem‐solving therapy, long‐term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment. We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported. Authors' conclusions CBT‐based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for self‐harm in adults Why is this review important? Self harm (SH), which includes non‐fatal intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is linked to risk of future suicide. It is distressing for both patients and their families and friends, and places large demands on clinical services. It is therefore important to assess the evidence on treatments for SH patients. Who will be interested in this review? Clinicians working with people who engage in SH, policy makers, people who themselves have engaged in SH or may be at risk of doing so, and their families and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999, which found little evidence of beneficial effects of psychosocial treatments on repetition of SH. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial treatments for patients with SH with a broader range of outcomes. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for adults who had recently engaged in SH. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 29 April 2015, and found 55 that met our inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have now been a number of investigations of psychosocial treatments for SH in adults, with greater representation in recent years of low‐ and middle‐income countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Some moderate quality evidence shows that cognitive‐behavioural‐based (CBT‐based) psychotherapy (a psychotherapy intended to change unhelpful thinking, emotions and behaviour) may help prevent repetition of SH, although it did not reduce overall frequency of SH. There were encouraging results (from small trials of moderate to very low quality) for other interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of SH in people with probable personality disorder, including group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy, mentalisation (a psychosocial therapy intended to increase a person’s understanding of their own and others' mental state), and dialectical behaviour therapies (DBT; psychosocial therapies intended to assist with identification of triggers that lead to reactive behaviours and to provide individuals with emotional coping skills to avoid these reactions). Whilst DBT was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at final follow‐up as compared to usual treatment, there was evidence of low quality suggesting a reduction in frequency of SH. There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of prolonged exposure to DBT, case management, approaches to improve treatment adherence, mixed multimodal interventions (comprising both psychological therapy and remote contact‐based interventions), remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, and telephone contact), interpersonal problem‐solving skills training, behaviour therapy, provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, home‐based problem‐solving therapy, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, intensive outpatient treatment, or long‐term psychotherapy. We had only limited evidence from a subset of the studies relating to whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. The trials did not report on side effects other than suicidal behaviour. What should happen next? The promising results for CBT‐based psychological therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy warrant further investigation to understand which patients benefit from these types of interventions. There were only a few, generally small trials on most other types of psychosocial therapies, providing little evidence of beneficial effects; however, these cannot be ruled out. There is a need for more information about whether psychosocial interventions might work differently between men and women.

AB: Abstract - Background Comorbid depression and substance use disorders are common and have poorer outcomes than either disorder alone. While effective psychological treatments for depression or substance use disorders are available, relatively few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the efficacy of these treatments in people with these comorbid disorders. Objectives To assess the efficacy of psychological interventions delivered alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy for people diagnosed with comorbid depression and substance use disorders. Search methods We searched the following databases up to February 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar and clinical trials registers. All systematic reviews identified, were handsearched for relevant articles. Selection criteria The review includes data from RCTs of psychological treatments for people diagnosed with comorbid depression and substance use disorders, using structured clinical interviews. Studies were included if some of the sample were experiencing another mental health disorder (e.g. anxiety); however, studies which required a third disorder as part of their inclusion criteria were not included. Studies were included if psychological interventions (with or without pharmacotherapy) were compared with no treatment, delayed treatment, treatment as usual or other psychological treatments. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Seven RCTs of psychological treatments with a total of 608 participants met inclusion criteria. All studies were published in the USA and predominately consisted of Caucasian samples. All studies compared different types of psychological treatments. Two studies compared Integrated Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) with Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF), another two studies compared Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression (IPT‐D) with other treatment (Brief Supportive Therapy (BST) or Psychoeducation). The other three studies compared different types or combinations of psychological treatments. No studies compared psychological interventions with no treatment or treatment as usual control conditions. The studies included a diverse range of participants (e.g. veterans, prisoners, community adults and adolescents). All studies were at high risk of performance bias, other main sources were selection, outcome detection and attrition bias. Due to heterogeneity between studies only two meta‐analyses were conducted. The first meta‐analysis focused on two studies (296 participants) comparing ICBT to TSF. Very low‐quality evidence revealed that while the TSF group had lower depression scores than the ICBT group at post‐treatment (mean difference (MD) 4.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 6.66; 212 participants), there was no difference between groups in depression symptoms (MD 1.53, 95% CI ‐1.73 to 4.79; 181 participants) at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up. At post‐treatment there was no difference between groups in proportion of days abstinent (MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐8.04 to 2.35; 220 participants), however, the ICBT group had a greater proportion of days abstinent than the TSF group at the six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD 10.76, 95% CI 3.10 to 18.42; 189 participants). There were no differences between the groups in treatment attendance (MD ‐1.27, 95% CI ‐6.10 to 3.56; 270 participants) or treatment retention (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.25; 296 participants). The second meta‐analysis was conducted with two studies (64 participants) comparing IPT‐D with other treatment (Brief Supportive Psychotherapy/Psychoeducation). Very low‐quality evidence indicated IPT‐D resulted in significantly lower depressive symptoms at post‐treatment (MD ‐0.54, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.04; 64 participants), but this effect was not maintained at three‐month follow‐up (MD 3.80, 95% CI ‐3.83 to 11.43) in the one study reporting follow‐up outcomes (38 participants; IPT‐D versus Psychoeducation). Substance use was examined separately in each study, due to heterogeneity in outcomes. Both studies found very low‐quality evidence of no significant differences in substance use outcomes at post‐treatment (percentage of days abstinent, IPD versus Brief Supportive Psychotherapy; MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐28.74 to 23.34; 26 participants) or at three‐month follow‐up (relative risk of relapse, IPT‐D versus Psychoeducation; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50; 38 participants). There was also very low‐quality evidence for no significant differences between groups in treatment retention (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.23; 64 participants). No adverse events were reported in any study. Authors' conclusions The conclusions of this review are limited due to the low number and very poor quality of included studies. No conclusions can be made about the efficacy of psychological interventions (delivered alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy) for the treatment of comorbid depression and substance use disorders, as they are yet to be compared with no treatment or treatment as usual in this population. In terms of differences between psychotherapies, although some significant effects were found, the effects were too inconsistent and small, and the evidence of too poor quality, to be of relevance to practice. Plain language summary Do psychological interventions work for people with both depression and substance use disorders? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if psychological interventions (delivered with or without pharmacotherapy) are effective for the treatment of comorbid depression and substance use disorders. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. Key messages No conclusions about the effectiveness of psychological interventions for the treatment of comorbid depression and substance use disorders can be made, due to the low number of studies found and very low quality of the evidence. More high‐quality studies comparing psychological interventions versus no treatment, delayed treatment, treatment as usual and other psychological interventions are needed. What was studied in the review? Comorbidity occurs for people experiencing mental disorders when the same person has two or more mental disorders. People diagnosed with depression are more likely to have substance use disorders, and vice versa. Comorbid disorders are associated with poorer clinical, social and vocational outcomes than either disorder alone. Psychological treatments for comorbid depression and substance use disorders are available, but relatively few have been tested. These treatments target psychological (thoughts, feelings, behaviours), social (family and personal relationships), and environmental risk factors (access to drugs) for depression and substance use. What are the main results of the review? The review authors searched for studies and found seven randomised controlled trials involving 608 people with comorbid depression and substance use disorders published between 2003 and 2014. All seven studies were published in the USA and predominately consisted of individuals from Caucasian backgrounds. No conclusions about the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered with or without pharmacotherapy could be made, as no studies comparing these interventions with no treatment, delayed treatment or treatment as usual were found. All seven studies compared different types or combinations of psychological treatments. Few consistent differences in depression or substance use treatment outcomes were found. No conclusions about which type of psychological intervention was most effective could be made, due to the low number of studies found and very low quality of the evidence . None of the studies reported any harms related to receiving psychological treatment for depression and substance use disorders. All studies were funded by university and government research grants in the USA. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to February 2019.

AB: Abstract - Background Clozapine is an efficacious treatment for treatment‐resistant schizophrenia; however its use can be limited by side effect intolerability. Sinus tachycardia is a common adverse event associated with clozapine treatment. Various pharmacological treatments are used to control heart rate increase due to clozapine use and can include a decreased rate of clozapine titration, a switch to a different antipsychotic, or treatment with negative chronotropic drugs. Objectives To assess the clinical effects and efficacy of pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia. To systematically review the adverse events associated with pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia. Search methods On 23 March 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions, at any dose and by any route of administration, for clozapine‐induced tachycardia. Data collection and analysis We independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre‐specified inclusion criteria. Main results The electronic searches located three references. However, we did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions With no studies meeting the inclusion criteria, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. There are currently insufficient data to confidently inform clinical practice. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether specific interventions, such as beta‐blockers, are less effective or more effective than standard courses of alternative treatments for tachycardia. This lack of evidence for the treatment of clozapine‐induced tachycardia has implications for research and practice. Well‐planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated. One trial is currently underway. Current practice outside of well‐designed randomised trials should be clearly justified. Plain language summary Pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Clozapine is the only treatment proven to be effective for those people who do not respond to other antipsychotic medications. A fast pulse rate (tachycardia) is one of the more common side effects associated with clozapine use. It is reported to occur in 25 out of every 100 people treated with clozapine. The occurrence of a fast pulse rate may lead to palpitations in the person treated with clozapine, which can be unpleasant and worrying. A fast pulse rate by itself is not necessarily dangerous to the person and can be treated. There are medications available to treat a fast pulse rate and slow it down to a normal rate. Examples of such medications include beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers. However, a fast pulse rate can lead to clozapine being stopped by doctors. This review is about ways to reduce this problem, to find out if any treatment for a fast heart rate with clozapine use is better than another. This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at treating a fast heart rate associated with clozapine treatment. Unfortunately, we found no studies that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on the treatment is much needed. Finding answers to this question will aid people treated with clozapine, and their doctors, in ensuring that a fast heart rate with clozapine can be treated and that clozapine can be safely continued.

AB: Abstract - Background Psychosis is a serious mental condition characterised by a loss of contact with reality. There may be a prodromal period or stage of psychosis, where early signs of symptoms indicating onset of first episode psychosis (FEP) occur. A number of services, incorporating multimodal treatment approaches (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions), developed worldwide, now focus on this prodromal period with the aim of preventing psychosis in people at risk of developing FEP. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of early interventions for people in the prodromal stage of psychosis. The secondary objective is, if possible, to compare the effectiveness of the various different interventions. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based Register of studies (including trials registers) on 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for participants older than 12 years, who had developed a prodromal stage of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Main results We included 20 studies with 2151 participants. The studies analysed 13 different comparisons. Group A comparisons explored the absolute effects of the experimental intervention. Group B were comparisons within which we could not be clear whether differential interactive effects were also ongoing. Group C comparisons explored differential effects between clearly distinct treatments. A key outcome for this review was ‘transition to psychosis’. For details of other main outcomes please see 'Summary of findings' tables. In Group A (comparisons of absolute effects) we found no clear difference between amino acids and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). When omega‐3 fatty acids were compared to placebo, fewer participants given the omega‐3 (10%) transitioned to psychosis compared to the placebo group (33%) during long‐term follow‐up of seven years (RR 0.24 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 81 participants; low‐quality evidence). In Group B (comparisons where complex interactions are probable) and in the subgroup focusing on antipsychotic drugs added to specific care packages, the amisulpiride + needs‐focused intervention (NFI) compared to NFI comparison (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 102 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and the olanzapine + supportive intervention compared to supportive intervention alone comparison (RR 0.58 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 60 participants; very low‐quality evidence) showed no clear differences between groups. In the second Group B subgroup (cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT)), when CBT + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy group transitioned to psychosis during follow‐up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in the supportive therapy alone group (RR 0.45 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89; 2 RCTs, 252 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The CBT + risperidone versus CBT + placebo comparison identified no clear difference between treatments (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.39 to 2.67; 1 RCT, 87 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and this also applies to the CBT + needs‐based intervention (NBI) + risperidone versus NBI comparison (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.39 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 59 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Group C (differential effects) also involved six comparisons. The first compared CBT with supportive therapy. No clear difference was found for the ‘transition to psychosis’ outcome (RR 0.74 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98; 1 RCT, 72 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The second subgroup compared CBT + supportive intervention was compared with a NBI + supportive intervention, again, data were equivocal, few and of very low quality (RR 6.32 95% CI 0.34 to 117.09; 1 RCT, 57 participants). In the CBT + risperidone versus supportive therapy comparison, again there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; 1 RCT, 71 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The three other comparisons in Group C demonstrated no clear differences between treatment groups. When cognitive training was compared to active control (tablet games) (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 62 participants; very low quality data), family treatment compared with enhanced care comparison (RR 0.54 95% CI 0.18 to 1.59; 2 RCTs, 229 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and integrated treatment compared to standard treatment comparison (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 79 participants; very low‐quality evidence) no effects of any of these approaches was evident. Authors' conclusions There has been considerable research effort in this area and several interventions have been trialled. The evidence available suggests that omega‐3 fatty acids may prevent transition to psychosis but this evidence is low quality and more research is needed to confirm this finding. Other comparisons did not show any clear differences in effect for preventing transition to psychosis but again, the quality of this evidence is very low or low and not strong enough to make firm conclusions. Plain language summary Early interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis Review question Is there high‐quality evidence indicating that interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis are effective? Background Psychoses are serious mental conditions characterised by a loss of contact with reality. The first clear episode of psychosis can be preceded by a 'prodromal' period of at least six months, where a person experiences gradual non‐specific changes in thoughts, perceptions, behaviours and functioning. Although an individual is experiencing changes, they have not yet started to experience the more obvious psychotic symptoms such as delusions (fixed false beliefs) or hallucinations (perceptions without a cause). A number of services with treatment approaches that combine pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial treatments, developed worldwide, are now focusing on prevention of psychosis in people at risk by giving treatments during this prodromal period. This review assesses the evidence available concerning the effects of different treatment approaches for people not yet diagnosed with a non affective psychosis but who are in the prodromal stage of psychosis. Searching for evidence On 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017 we ran electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of studies in order to find clinical studies that randomly allocated individuals at risk of developing psychosis to receive various treatments for preventing development of psychosis. Evidence found We were able to include 20 studies with 2151 participants. These studies analysed a wide range of treatments. All the review findings are of, at very best, low quality. There is some suggestion from one small study that people at risk of psychosis may benefit from taking omega‐3 fatty acids in terms of reduced transition to psychosis. Other studies found adding antipsychotic drugs to supportive‐care packages did not seem to make much difference in terms of transition to full illness. When cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants treated allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy transitioned to psychosis during follow‐up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in people who just received supportive therapy. This could be important but these data are of very low quality. All other testing of CBT and other packages of care found no clear difference between treatments for transition to psychosis. Conclusions There has been considerable effort and expense invested testing treatment approaches for prevention of the first episode of schizophrenia. Currently, there is some low‐quality evidence suggesting that omega‐3 fatty acids may be effective, but there is no high‐quality evidence to suggest that any type of treatment is effective, and no firm conclusions can be made.

AB: Abstract - Background It is estimated that up to 75% of cancer survivors may experience cognitive impairment as a result of cancer treatment and given the increasing size of the cancer survivor population, the number of affected people is set to rise considerably in coming years. There is a need, therefore, to identify effective, non‐pharmacological interventions for maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment among people with a previous cancer diagnosis. Objectives To evaluate the cognitive effects, non‐cognitive effects, duration and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions among cancer patients targeted at maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment as a result of cancer or receipt of systemic cancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy or hormonal therapies in isolation or combination with other treatments). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PUBMED, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO databases. We also searched registries of ongoing trials and grey literature including theses, dissertations and conference proceedings. Searches were conducted for articles published from 1980 to 29 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non‐pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive functioning among survivors of adult‐onset cancers who have completed systemic cancer therapy (in isolation or combination with other treatments) were eligible. Studies among individuals continuing to receive hormonal therapy were included. We excluded interventions targeted at cancer survivors with central nervous system (CNS) tumours or metastases, non‐melanoma skin cancer or those who had received cranial radiation or, were from nursing or care home settings. Language restrictions were not applied. Data collection and analysis Author pairs independently screened, selected, extracted data and rated the risk of bias of studies. We were unable to conduct planned meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity in the type of interventions and outcomes, with the exception of compensatory strategy training interventions for which we pooled data for mental and physical well‐being outcomes. We report a narrative synthesis of intervention effectiveness for other outcomes. Main results Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review. Two trials of computer‐assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed‐ and immediate‐ memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well‐being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed‐, immediate‐ and verbal‐memory, self‐reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta‐analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well‐being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.59 to 0.83; I 2 = 67%) or two months post‐intervention (SMD ‐ 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.89 to 0.47; I 2  = 63%) or on mental well‐being two months post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐1.10 to 0.34; I 2  = 67%). Lower mental well‐being immediately post‐intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait‐list controls (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.16; I 2  = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be  low quality  and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear. Authors' conclusions Overall, the, albeit l ow‐quality evidence  may be interpreted to suggest that non‐pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment. Larger, multi‐site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach. There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment among cancer patient groups other than women with breast cancer. Plain language summary Interventions for cognitive impairment due to non‐localised cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy The issue An increasing number of people are surviving and living longer with cancer due to earlier diagnosis, better treatments and an aging population. In turn, there is an increasing number of people with long‐term or long‐lasting effects of cancer and its treatment. For example, up to seven in 10 cancer survivors experience changes in ability regarding memory, learning new things, concentrating, planning and making decisions about their everyday life, as a result of cancer treatment. This is known as cognitive impairment and has a significant impact on the daily activities of cancer survivors. These changes may be caused by non‐localised, systemic cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and is often called 'chemo‐fog' or 'chemobrain'. The aim of the review We reviewed studies that have tested interventions intended to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive function among people who have been treated with systemic cancer treatments. What are the main findings? We identified five eligible studies that described six interventions. These included two studies of computerised cognitive skills practice, two cognitive coping skills training programmes, one meditation intervention and one exercise intervention. All five studies included a total of 235 women who had been treated for breast cancer. The findings suggest that cognitive skills practice and cognitive coping skills training may be useful in improving patient reports and formal assessments of cognition, as well as quality of life. There was insufficient evidence to know if meditation and exercise interventions had any effect on cognition. What is the quality of the evidence? The quality of the evidence was low. There were problems with study designs and, so, we need to be cautious about our conclusions. What are the conclusions? There is not enough good quality evidence to know if any interventions improve cognitive impairment or maintain cognitive functioning among people who have received systemic treatment for cancer. There are several ongoing trials in the field, which may provide the necessary evidence in the future.

AB: Abstract - Background Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression. Objectives 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies. 2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)‐Europe E‐theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the "Awaiting classification" section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic. Main results We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta‐analysis examining short‐term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate‐quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician‐rated depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.69 to ‐0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.85, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low‐quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate‐quality evidence). Findings of the present meta‐analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short‐term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician‐rated depression (SMD ‐0.78, 95% CI ‐2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low‐quality evidence), patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐1.28, 95% CI ‐3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low‐quality evidence), quality of life (SMD ‐1.31, 95% CI ‐ 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low‐quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate‐quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician‐rated depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), quality of life (SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety. Authors' conclusions Findings of the present meta‐analysis indicate that music therapy provides short‐term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression. It is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes. Plain language summary Music therapy for depression Why is this review important? Depression is a common problem that causes changes in mood and loss of interest and pleasure. Music therapy, an intervention that involves regular meetings with a qualified music therapist, may help in improving mood through emotional expression. This review might add new information about effects of music therapy in depressed individuals. Who will be interested in this review? Our review will be of interest for the following people: people with depression and their families, friends, and carers; general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other professionals working in mental health; music therapists working in mental health; and mental health policy makers. What questions does this review aim to answer? 1. Is music therapy more effective than treatment as usual alone or psychological therapy? 2. Is any form of music therapy better than another form of music therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We included nine studies with a total of 421 people of any age group (from adolescents to older people). Studies compared effects of music therapy versus treatment as usual, and versus psychological therapy. Additionally, we examined the differences between two different forms of music therapy: active (where people sing or play music) and receptive (where people listen to music). What does evidence from the review tell us? We found that music therapy plus treatment as usual is more effective than treatment as usual alone. Music therapy seems to reduce depressive symptoms and anxiety and helps to improve functioning (e.g. maintaining involvement in job, activities, and relationships). We are not sure whether music therapy is better than psychological therapy. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another. The small numbers of identified studies and participants make it hard to be confident about these comparisons. What should happen next? Music therapy for depression is likely to be effective for people in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Music therapy also helps people to function in their everyday life. However, our findings are not complete and need to be clarified through additional research. Future trials should study depression in children and adolescents, and future trial reports should thoroughly describe music therapy interventions, other interventions, and the person who delivers these interventions.

AB: Abstract - Background Infant massage is increasingly being used in the community with babies and their primary caregivers. Anecdotal reports suggest benefits for sleep, respiration and elimination, the reduction of colic and wind, and improved growth. Infant massage is also thought to reduce infant stress and promote positive parent‐infant interaction. Objectives The aim of this review was to assess whether infant massage is effective in promoting infant physical and mental health in low‐risk, population samples. Search methods Relevant studies were identified by searching the following electronic databases up to June 2011: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Maternity and Infant Care; LILACS; WorldCat (dissertations); ClinicalTrials.gov; China Masters' Theses; China Academic Journals; China Doctoral Dissertations; China Proceedings of Conference. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. Selection criteria We included studies that randomised healthy parent‐infant dyads (where the infant was under the age of six months) to an infant massage group or a 'no‐treatment' control group. Studies had to have used a standardised outcome measure of infant mental or physical development. Data collection and analysis Mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. Where appropriate, the results have been combined in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Main results We included 34 studies, which includes one that was a follow‐up study and 20 that were rated as being at high risk of bias. We conducted 14 meta‐analyses assessing physical outcomes post‐intervention. Nine meta‐analyses showed significant findings favouring the intervention group for weight (MD ‐965.25 g; 95% CI ‐1360.52 to ‐569.98), length (MD ‐1.30 cm; 95% CI ‐1.60 to ‐1.00), head circumference (MD ‐0.81 cm; 95% CI ‐1.18 to ‐0.45), arm circumference (MD ‐0.47 cm; 95% CI ‐0.80 to ‐0.13), leg circumference (MD ‐0.31 cm; 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.13), 24‐hour sleep duration (MD ‐0.91 hr; 95% CI ‐1.51 to ‐0.30), time spent crying/fussing (MD ‐0.36; 95% CI ‐0.52 to ‐0.19), deceased levels of blood bilirubin (MD ‐38.11 mmol/L; 95% CI ‐50.61 to ‐25.61), and there were fewer cases of diarrhoea, RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.76). Non‐significant results were obtained for cortisol levels, mean increase in duration of night sleep, mean increase in 24‐hour sleep and for number of cases of upper respiratory tract disease and anaemia. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for weight, length and head circumference, and only the finding for length remained significant following removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias. These three outcomes were the only ones that could also be meta‐analysed at follow‐up; although both weight and head circumference continued to be significant at 6‐month follow‐up, these findings were obtained from studies conducted in Eastern countries only. No sensitivity analyses were possible. We conducted 18 meta‐analyses measuring aspects of mental health and development. A significant effect favouring the intervention group was found for gross motor skills (SMD ‐0.44; 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.18), fine motor skills (SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.35), personal and social behaviour (SMD ‐0.90; 95% CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.18) and psychomotor development (SMD ‐0.35; 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.15); although the first three findings were obtained from only two studies, one of which was rated as being at high risk of bias, and the finding for psychomotor development was not maintained following following removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias in a sensitivity analysis. No significant differences were found for a range of aspects of infant temperament, parent‐infant interaction and mental development. Only parent‐infant interaction could be meta‐analysed at follow‐up, and the result was again not significant. Authors' conclusions These findings do not currently support the use of infant massage with low‐risk groups of parents and infants. Available evidence is of poor quality, and many studies do not address the biological plausibility of the outcomes being measured, or the mechanisms by which change might be achieved. Future research should focus on the impact of infant massage in higher‐risk groups (for example, demographically and socially deprived parent‐infant dyads), where there may be more potential for change. Plain language summary Massage for promoting mental and physical health in infants under the age of six months This review aimed to assess the impact of infant massage on mental and physical outcomes for healthy mother‐infant dyads in the first six months of life. A total of 34 randomised trials were included. Twenty of these had significant problems with their design and the way they were carried out. This means that the we are not as confident as we would otherwise be that the findings are valid. That is to say, the findings of these 20 included studies may over‐ or under‐estimate the true effect of massage therapy.  We combined the data for 14 outcomes measured physical health and 18 outcomes measured aspects of mental health or development. The results show limited statistically significant benefits for a number of aspects of physical health (for example, weight, length, head/arm/leg circumference, 24‐hour sleep duration; time spent crying or fussing; blood bilirubin and number of episodes of illness) and mental health/development (for example, fine/gross motor skills personal and social behaviour and psychomotor development). However, all significant results were lost either at later follow‐up points or when we removed the large number of studies regarded to be at high risk of bias. These findings do not currently support the use of infant massage with low‐risk population groups of parents and infants. The results obtained from this review may be due to the poor quality of many of the included studies, the failure to address the mechanisms by which infant massage could have an impact on the outcomes being assessed, and the inclusion of inappropriate outcomes for population groups (such as weight gain). Future research should focus on the benefits of infant massage for higher‐risk population groups (for example, socially deprived parent‐infant dyads), the duration of massage programmes, and could address differences between babies being massaged by parents or healthcare professionals.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with severe mental illness (SMI) have siblings. Siblings are often both natural agents to promote service users’ recovery and vulnerable to mental ill health due to the negative impact of psychosis within the family. Despite a wealth of research evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychoeducation for service users with SMI and their family members, in reducing relapse and promoting compliance with treatment, siblings remain relatively invisible in clinical service settings as well as in research studies. If psychoeducational interventions target siblings and improve siblings' knowledge, coping with caring and overall wellbeing, they could potentially provide a cost‐effective option for supporting siblings with resulting benefits for service users' outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychoeducation compared with usual care or any other intervention in promoting wellbeing and reducing distress of siblings of people affected by SMI. The secondary objective was, if possible, to determine which type of psychoeducation is most effective. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and screened the reference lists of relevant reports and reviews (12th November 2013). We contacted trial authors for unpublished and specific data on siblings' outcomes. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on psychoeducational interventions targeting siblings of all ages (on their own or amongst other family members including service users) of individuals with SMI, using any means and formats of delivery, i.e. individual (family), groups, computer‐based. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data and two other authors independently checked the screening and extraction process. We contacted authors of trials to ascertain siblings' participation in the trials and seek sibling‐specific data in those studies where siblings' data were grouped together with other participants' (most commonly other family members'/carers') outcomes. We calculated the risk difference (RD), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We presented continuous data using the mean difference statistic (MD) and 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and rated quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Main results We found 14 studies that included siblings amongst other family members in receipt of psychoeducational interventions. However, we were only able to include one small trial with relevant and available data (n = 9 siblings out of n = 84 family member/carer‐participants) comparing psychoeducational intervention with standard care in a community care setting, over a duration of 21 months. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on 'siblings' quality of life' (n = 9, MD score 3.80 95% CI ‐0.26 to 7.86,  low quality of evidence ), coping with (family) burden (n = 9, MD ‐8.80 95% CI ‐15.22 to ‐2.34,  low quality of evidence ). No sibling left the study early by one year (n = 9, RD 0.00 CI ‐0.34 to 0.34,  low quality of evidence ). Low quality and insufficient evidence meant we were unable to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on service users' global mental state (n = 9, MD ‐0.60 CI ‐3.54 to 2.38,  low quality of evidence ), their frequency of re‐hospitalisation (n = 9, MD ‐0.70 CI ‐2.46 to 1.06,  low quality of evidence ) or duration of inpatient stay (n = 9, MD ‐2.60 CI ‐6.34 to 1.14,  low quality of evidence ), whether their siblings received psychoeducation or not. No study data were available to address the other primary outcomes: 'siblings' psychosocial wellbeing', 'siblings' distress' and adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Most studies evaluating psychoeducational interventions recruited siblings along with other family members. However, the proportion of siblings in these studies was low and outcomes for siblings were not reported independently from those of other types of family members. Indeed, only data from one study with nine siblings were available for the review. The limited study data we obtained provides no clear good quality evidence to indicate psychoeducation is beneficial for siblings' wellbeing or for clinical outcomes of people affected by SMI. More randomised studies are justified and needed to understand the role of psychoeducation in addressing siblings' needs for information and support. Plain language summary Psychoeducation for brothers and/or sisters of people with severe mental illness (SMI) Review question . This review compares psychoeducation for siblings of people with severe mental illness versus standard care or any other intervention as a means of improving their own wellbeing and quality of life as well as coping with the care‐giving for their mentally ill siblings. Background . Psychoeducation programmes aim to improve knowledge and understanding of mental health. Family members, inlcuding siblings, of people with severe mental illness are often offered psychoeducation. It is supposed that increased knowledge will help the brother or sister to cope more effectively with providing care for their mentally ill sibling and enhance their own wellbeing. Psychoeducational interventions involve an interaction between the information provider and the sibling of the mentally ill person. This can be delivered in different ways, such as face‐to‐face or via online forums or by a mixture of these methods. Study characteristics . A search for randomised trials investigating psychoeducation for the siblings of people with severe mental illness was run in 2013. Results of the search suggest that brothers and sisters form a small proportion of family members participating in studies of this kind. Only one study meeting the review criteria was found. This study included nine siblings and compared a psychoeducational intervention with standard care in a community care setting, over a period of 21 months. Key results . Better outcomes in terms of coping were identified for those siblings who received psychoeducation. However, the number of participants was small and the quality of evidence low, and there is no conclusive evidence that psychoeducation is of benefit for brothers/sisters in this and other important areas (such as wellbeing, quality of life) or for the outcomes of people with mental illness (such as mental state, hospital admission or length of hospital stay). Quality of the evidence . Further studies are needed to understand the role of psychoeducation in specifically helping brothers and/or sisters to cope with providing care for their mentally ill siblings. The scarcity of good quality studies means that it is not possible to assess which type of psychoeducation is the most effective, although interventions using a group format that brings many family members together to receive education and share their experiences seem well‐received by the participants.

AB: Abstract - Background Intensive Case Management (ICM) is a community‐based package of care aiming to provide long‐term care for severely mentally ill people who do not require immediate admission. Intensive Case Management evolved from two original community models of care, Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Case Management (CM), where ICM emphasises the importance of small caseload (fewer than 20) and high‐intensity input. Objectives To assess the effects of ICM as a means of caring for severely mentally ill people in the community in comparison with non‐ICM (caseload greater than 20) and with standard community care. We did not distinguish between models of ICM. In addition, to assess whether the effect of ICM on hospitalisation (mean number of days per month in hospital) is influenced by the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and by the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted (baseline level of hospital use). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (last update search 10 April 2015). Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, aged 18 to 65 years and treated in the community care setting, where ICM is compared to non‐ICM or standard care. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We performed a random‐effects meta‐regression analysis to examine the association of the intervention's fidelity to the ACT model and the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted with the treatment effect. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach and investigated possible risk of bias within included trials. Main results The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies. The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non‐ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. 1. ICM versus standard care When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.34, low‐quality evidence ). Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79,  low‐quality evidence ). For the outcome adverse events, the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51,  low‐quality evidence ). In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low‐quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0,  very low‐quality evidence ). 2. ICM versus non‐ICM When ICM was compared with non‐ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate‐quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.21,  moderate‐quality evidence ) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.05,  moderate‐quality evidence ) compared to non‐ICM. Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, low‐quality evidence ) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84,  low‐quality evidence ). Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non‐ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74,  very low‐quality evidence ). 3. Fidelity to ACT Within the meta‐regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline hospital use' variable coefficient ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.32 to ‐0.10). Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient ‐0.18, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.07, P = 0.0027). Authors' conclusions Based on very low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness. Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care. It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illnesses in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years). Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital. However, it is unclear what overall gain ICM provides on top of a less formal non‐ICM approach. We do not think that more trials comparing current ICM with standard care or non‐ICM are justified, however we currently know of no review comparing non‐ICM with standard care, and this should be undertaken. Plain language summary Intensive case management for people with severe mental illness Background Severe mental illnesses are defined by diagnosis, degree of disability and the presence of some abnormal behaviour. Including schizophrenia and psychosis, severe mood problems, and personality disorder, severe mental illness can cause considerable distress over a long period of time to both the person affected and his or her family and friends.  Until the 1970s, it was common for those suffering from these disorders to remain in an institution for most of their lives, but in most of the countries of the world, they are now managed in the community with one of several different types of intervention. Intensive Case Management (ICM) is one such intervention. It consists of management of the mental health problem and the rehabilitation and social support needs of the person concerned, over an indefinite period of time, by a team of people who have a fairly small group of clients (fewer than 20). Twenty‐four‐hour help is offered and clients are seen in a non‐clinical setting.    Aims of the review To find and present good‐quality evidence concerning the effectiveness of ICM compared with non‐ICM (where people receive the same package of care, but the professionals have caseloads of more than 20 people) and standard care (where people are seen as outpatients, but their support needs are less clearly defined) for people with severe mental illness.  Searching for evidence We carried out electronic searches for randomised controlled trials comparing ICM with non‐ICM or standard care in 2009, 2012, and 2015. Results We included 40 trials involving 7524 people. The trials took place in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and the USA. When ICM was compared to standard care, those in the ICM group were more likely to stay with the service, have improved general functioning, get a job, not be homeless, and have shorter stays in hospital (especially when they had had very long stays in hospital previously). When ICM was compared to non‐ICM, the only clear difference was that those in the ICM group were more likely to be kept in care.  Conclusions None of the evidence for the main outcomes of interest was high quality; at best the evidence was of moderate quality. In addition, the healthcare and social support systems of the countries where the studies took place were quite different, so it was difficult to make valid overall conclusions. Furthermore, we were unable to use much of the data on quality of life and patient and carer satisfaction because the trials used many different scales to measure these outcomes, some of which were not validated.  The development of an overall scale and its validation would be very beneficial in producing services that people favour.

AB: Abstract - Background Non‐compliance is a significant problem among people with serious mental disorders, presenting a challenge for mental health professionals. Prompts such as telephone calls, visits, and a posted referral letter to patients are currently used to encourage patient attendance at clinics and/or compliance with medication. More recently, the use of information and communication technology (ICT)‐based prompting methods have increased. Methods include mobile text message (SMS ‐ short message service), e‐mail or use of any other electronic device with the stated purpose of encouraging compliance. Objectives To investigate the effects of ICT‐based prompting to support treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness compared with standard care. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (31 st  May 2011 and 9 th  July 2012) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. Also, we inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria Relevant randomised controlled trials involving adults with serious mental illness, comparing any ICT‐based prompt or combination of prompts by automatic or semi‐automatic system compared with standard care. Data collection and analysis Review authors reliably assessed trial quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups, again with 95% confidence intervals. A 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE was created, and we assessed included studies for risk of bias. Main results The search identified 35 references, with 25 studies, but we could only include two studies with a total of 358 participants. The studies had a moderate risk of bias, and therefore risk overestimating any positive effects of ICT‐based prompting. Both included studies compared semi‐automatised ICT‐based prompting intervention with standard care groups in mental health outpatient care. The interventions were SMS‐message and an electronic assistant device. One included study reported our primary outcome, compliance. There was not any clear evidence that ICT‐based prompts increase improvement in compliance (stop taking medication within six months n = 320, RR 1.11 CI 0.96 to 1.29,  moderate quality evidence ). There was some low quality evidence that ICT‐based prompts have small effects for: mental state (average change in specific symptom scores within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.30 CI ‐0.53 to ‐0.07; severity of illness within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.07 and six months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.07; average change in depressive scores within six months n = 251, RR 0.00 CI ‐0.28 to 0.28; global symptoms within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.07; negative symptoms within three months n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.38 to 0.18 and six months n = 251, MD ‐0.30 CI ‐0.58 to 0.02,  low quality evidence).  Level of insight improved more among people receiving ICT‐based prompt compared with those in the control group at six months (n = 251, MD ‐0.10 CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.07). ICT‐based prompts also increased quality of life (average change in quality of life within six months n = 251, RR 0.50 CI 0.19 to 0.81,  moderate quality evidence ). Based on the existing data, there is no evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other (n = 347, 2 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.70 to 3.05,  low quality evidence ). Included studies did not report outcomes of service utilisation, behaviour, costs or adverse events. Authors' conclusions The evidence base on the effects of ICT‐based prompts is still inconclusive. Data to clarify ICT‐based prompting effects are awaited from an ongoing trial, but further well‐conducted trials considering the different ICT‐based prompts are warranted. Plain language summary Using information and communication‐based prompting for patients with serious mental illness Recently there has been an increase in the use of ICT (Information Communication Technology) for the delivery of information to people with severe mental illness. ICT is considered to be any technical means of delivering information and communication and can include use of telephones, television, radio, computers and hand‐held devices. People with severe mental health problems often have difficulties with 'treatment compliance' i.e. following their treatment programme. They can have difficulty remembering to take medication or appointment times. Unpleasant side effects of medication can also lead to people stopping medication, and a lack of insight into their illness can mean they do not see the need to follow treatments. Non‐compliance with treatment can lead to poor health outcomes and even relapses and hospitalisation. There are several methods healthcare professionals use to help people with serious mental illness improve compliance; once such method is prompting. The purpose of prompting is to help patients to follow the treatment instructions and keep the treatment appointment times by using reminders via telephone calls, personal visits or posted referral letter. More recently, Information and technology‐based prompts are being used. This review investigates the effectiveness of ICT‐based prompts in order to support treatment compliance among patients with serious mental illness. A search for randomised controlled trials was run in 2012. Two trials that compared the use of ICT prompting compared with standard care could be included. Review authors rated the quality of data in these as 'moderate' or 'low'. Because of the small amount of data, it is impossible to say whether ICT‐based prompts are effective. Only one trial measured medication compliance. The study suggested that ICT‐based prompts may help people take their medication, but clear evidence of a benefit is missing. There were some positive effects for patient insight. However, insight was only better in the medium term and appeared to show no difference in the short term. Further, some positive effect was found in patient satisfaction with treatment, although the results for the analyses were imprecise. Also, mental state and quality of life showed minor improvement. There were no clear evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other. Outcomes such as service use, behaviour, costs or adverse effects were not presented in the studies. There is an ongoing trial, but additional well‐conducted trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background The teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work‐related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational‐level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work‐related stress in teachers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and controlled before‐and‐after studies of organisational‐level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster‐randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped‐wedge design. Changing task characteristics One study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task‐based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from ‐3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low‐quality evidence). Changing organisational characteristics Two studies compared teacher training combined with school‐wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job‐related anxiety (MD ‐0.25 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.11, very low‐quality evidence) or depression (MD ‐0.26 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.05, very low‐quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD ‐0.05 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.42, low‐quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.33, low‐quality evidence) after six months. Multi‐component intervention One study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi‐component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched‐comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow‐up, very low‐quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias. Authors' conclusions We found low‐quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex‐interventions framework, use a cluster‐randomised design and have large sample sizes. Plain language summary Work changes to prevent and decrease stress in teachers Background Teachers often experience stress at work, which can lead to physical and mental health problems, increased sickness absence, teacher resignations, and decline in children's performance and health. Individual stress management and counselling programmes directed at teachers only target stress symptoms, while interventions directed at the school organisation target the causes of stress. We searched for studies until January 2015 to assess the evidence on work changes to improve wellbeing and reduce work‐related stress in teachers. Study Characteristics We found four studies that included a total of 2199 teachers. They evaluated three types of work changes. One intervention consisted of changes in teachers' tasks such as redesigning work, establishing flexible work schedules and redesigning the work environment. Another intervention consisted of a school‐wide coaching support network alongside individual training for teachers, in order to deliver a child development programme. The third intervention consisted of several components: performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. Results Changes in tasks of teachers In one study with 961 teachers in eight schools, changes in tasks of teachers combined with stress management training resulted in a small reduction in work stress levels after one year follow‐up compared to no intervention. There was also a small increase in work ability, meaning how well a worker is able to perform his or her work. However, the authors did not report how they changed teachers' tasks, limiting the results' usefulness elsewhere. Changing organisational features There were two studies of school‐wide coaching support combined with teacher training. In one study with 43 schools and 59 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on anxiety or depression after two years follow‐up compared to no intervention. In the other study with 18 schools and 77 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on burnout or emotional ability after six months follow‐up compared to no intervention. Burnout is a state of prolonged severe stress. Emotional ability means understanding other people’s emotions, and understanding and controlling ones own emotions. Both studies had a small number of participants. Multicomponent programme In one study with 34 schools and 1102 teachers, the intervention included performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. After three years follow‐up and compared to 300 similar schools, there was a moderate reduction in resignation of teachers in the intervention schools. However, authors reported results only for eight schools. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low for all interventions because the authors did not report all the results and lost many participants for follow‐up. All included studies also had interventions directed at individual teachers combined with changes at schools. Therefore, new and better quality studies directed at schools will probably change the conclusions of this review. Conclusion Changing the way teachers' work is organised at schools may improve the teachers' wellbeing and may reduce teacher resignations. We need better‐designed research in the development and testing of work changes in schools. In future studies, whether work at schools is changed or not should be determined according to chance. These studies should also have several hundred participants.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a collective name for different degenerative brain syndromes which, according to Alzheimer's Disease International, affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide. The latest NICE guideline for dementia highlights the value of diverse treatment options for the different stages and symptoms of dementia including non‐pharmacological treatments. Relevant literature also argues for the value of interventions that acknowledge the complexity of the condition and address the person as a whole, including their physical, emotional, social and cognitive processes. At the same time, there is growing literature that highlights the capacity of the arts and embodied practices to address this complexity. Dance movement therapy is an embodied psychological intervention that can address complexity and thus, may be useful for people with dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of dance movement therapy on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms of people with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. Also, to compare different forms of dance movement therapy (e.g. Laban‐based dance movement therapy, Chacian dance movement therapy or Authentic Movement). Search methods Searches took place up to March 2016 through ALOIS, Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement’s Specialized Register, which covers CENTRAL, a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers, and grey literature sources. We checked bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, and contacted professional associations, educational programmes and experts from around the world. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, including cross‐over design and cluster‐RCTs for inclusion. Studies considered had to include people with dementia, in any age group and in any setting, with interventions delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted. Data collection and analysis The two review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality. Main results Of the 102 studies identified through electronic searches and personal communication, after de‐duplication we screened 80 at title/abstract level. We then reviewed 19 full papers, none of which met the inclusion criteria. Although three studies mentioned dance movement therapy as their intervention, they were excluded because they were not delivered by a qualified dance movement therapy practitioner. As a result, no studies were included in this review. Authors' conclusions Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia. Plain language summary Is dance movement therapy an effective intervention for dementia? A review of the evidence Why is this review important? Dementia currently affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide and there is an expectation that, as people are growing older, there will be a substantial increase in the number of people affected. Dementia literature argues for the need to address the complexity of the symptoms and work with the person as a whole. It is possible that dance movement therapy, an embodied psychological intervention that uses movement and dance to express and explore emotions, may be useful for people with dementia. However, its effectiveness remains unclear. This is the first review of the effectiveness of dance movement therapy for dementia and will add to the evidence base regarding available non‐pharmacological interventions for dementia. Who might be interested in this review? It is expected that this review will be of interest to people affected by dementia and their carers as well as general practitioners, mental health professionals and psychological therapists. What questions does this review aim to answer? We asked the following questions. Is dance movement therapy more effective than no treatment or standard care? Is dance movement therapy more effective than any other treatment? How effective are different types of dance movement therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of dance movement therapy for dementia up to March 2016, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity. No study met the inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was no evidence for or against dance movement therapy as a useful intervention for dementia. What should happen next? Well‐designed studies with a large number of participants and well‐defined interventions are needed before we are clear on whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia or not.

AB: Abstract - Background Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder. It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long‐term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care settings. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) ’s Specialised Register of dementia trials ( dementia.cochrane.org/our‐trials‐register ), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost‐related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time‐to‐event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster‐RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non‐pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary. It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration‐based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12‐month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant‐months; low‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness). Authors' conclusions Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC. A software‐based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist‐led medication review, probably reduces incidence of delirium in older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the US and may not be practical in other countries or settings which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. In the educational intervention aimed at identifying risk factors for delirium and developing bespoke solutions within care homes, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence, prevalence or mortality. This evidence is based on a small feasibility trial. Our review identified three ongoing trials of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. We identified no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of multicomponent non‐pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence‐based care for this vulnerable group. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care (LTC) Review question How effective are treatments to prevent delirium in older people living in long‐term care (LTC)? Background LTC is the name used for residential homes, which provide personal care, supervision with medications and help with day‐to‐day activities, and nursing homes, which provide 24‐hour nursing care. Delirium is a common and serious illness for older people living in LTC. Delirium is a condition that causes confusion, usually over a few hours or days. Some people with delirium become quiet and sleepy while others become agitated and disorientated, so it can be a very distressing condition. Delirium can increase the chances of being admitted to hospital, developing dementia and can increase the risk of death. Importantly, studies of people in hospital have shown that it is possible to prevent around a third of cases of delirium by providing an environment and care plan that target the main delirium risk factors, including, providing better lighting and signs to avoid disorientation; avoiding unnecessary use of catheters to help prevent infection; and avoiding certain medications which increase the risk of delirium. This review has searched for and assessed research on preventing delirium in older people living in LTC. Study characteristics The evidence is current to February 2019. We found three studies that included 3851 participants. Two studies took place in the US and one study in the UK. One study tested whether delirium could be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring hydration was maintained. There were 98 people in the study, which lasted four weeks. One study tested the effect of a computer program which searched for prescriptions of medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium, to enable a pharmacist to adjust or stop them. There were 3538 people in the study, which lasted 12 months. One study tested an enhanced educational intervention which included learning sessions on delirium with care home staff and group meetings to identity targets for preventing delirium. There were 215 people in the study, which lasted 16 months. Key findings It was not possible to determine if the hydration intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium. This was a small study of short duration with serious design problems. The study of a computerised medication search programme probably reduced delirium, but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls. A potential problem is that it might not be possible to use this computer program in different countries that do not have similar computer systems available. It was not possible to determine if the enhanced education intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium and there was no clear reduction in the number of deaths. The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions. This is based on findings from a small study. Quality of the evidence There is very low‐quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme may reduce the incidence of delirium. There is no clear evidence for reducing hospitalisations, mortality or falls. There is very low‐quality evidence of the effectiveness of an enhanced educational intervention for reducing delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence for reducing hospital admissions. As this review only found a small number of research studies, we recommend that further research be conducted, testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people in LTC.

AB: Abstract - Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non‐randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of psychological therapy, light therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence. Main results We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full‐text review for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of blinding. The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45‐ to 60‐minute sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology‐Self‐Report (IDS‐SR, range 0‐90) from September 2011 to mid‐April 2012. The incidence of a new depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS‐SR ≥ 20), compared to 74% of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality‐evidence). For participants with depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups. Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS‐SR, and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI ‐3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality‐evidence). The overall discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low quality‐evidence). Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors' conclusions The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes a depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who might be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced SAD or who has relatives and friends who have experienced SAD, as well as researchers working in this field might be interested in this review. What questions does this review aim to answer? The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. However, little is known about the efficacy and potential harms of interventions for preventing SAD. This is one of four reviews conducted to examine the efficacy and side effects of interventions used to prevent SAD; this review focuses on psychological therapy as a preventive intervention in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms at the time the preventive intervention was started. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to 19 June 2018 for studies on psychological therapies to prevent SAD. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received a form of psychological therapy ‐ the so called mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) or treatment as usual. Treatment as usual meant that participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. All individuals in these studies had a history of winter depression and were free of depressive symptoms when the study started. What does evidence from this review reveal? The proportion of participants developing a depression in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups as well as the severity of these depressive episodes. However, the quality of the evidence was very low, so we can draw no valid conclusion if MBCT is really ineffective in preventing SAD or not. The included study reported no information on side effects of the intervention. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of MBCT and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as other psychological therapies, drug treatments, or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, treatment selection should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of different psychological therapies in preventing SAD in larger study samples and should directly compare these interventions versus other preventive treatments, such as light therapy, antidepressants and agomelatine, to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.

AB: Abstract - Background Nidotherapy is a therapeutic method that principally aims to modify the environment of people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses, whilst working in conjunction with, or alongside other treatments. Rather than focusing on direct treatments or interventions, the aim is to help the individual identify the need for, and work to effect environmental change with the aim of minimising the impact of any form of mental disorder on the individual and society. Objectives To review the effects of nidotherapy added to standard care, compared with standard care or no treatment for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2011) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching nidotherapy articles and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared nidotherapy with standard care or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We independently selected and quality assessed potential trials. We reliably extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data. Scale data were only extracted from valid scales. For non‐skewed continuous endpoint data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. Skewed data have been presented in the Data and analyses as 'other data', with acknowledged means and standard deviations. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We included only one study that compared nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care with standard care alone (total 52 participants); this study was classified by its authors as a 'pilot study'. The duration of the included study was 18 months in total. The single study examined the short‐term (up to six months) and medium‐term (between six and 12 months) effects of nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care versus standard care. Nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care was favoured over standard care for social functioning in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐4.66 to 0.46) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD ‐1.70, 95% CI ‐4.60 to 1.20,  Very low quality ); however, these results did not reach statistical significance. Results concerning engagement with non‐inpatient services favoured the intervention group in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.87) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD 1.70, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 3.49), with statistical significance evident in the short term, but not in the medium term. Results of people leaving the study early favoured the intervention in the short term (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.98), with slight favour of the control group at medium term (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.54); again, these results did not reach statistical significance. Results for the adverse effects/events of death (measured by 12 months) favoured the intervention (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.74,  Very low quality ) but with no statistical significance. Skewed results were available for mental state, service use, and economic outcomes, and present a mixed picture of the benefits of nidotherapy. Authors' conclusions Further research is needed into the possible benefits or harms of this newly‐formulated therapy. Until such research is available, patients, clinicians, managers and policymakers should consider it an experimental approach. Plain language summary Nidotherapy for schizophrenia Nidotherapy (from the Latin ‘ nidus ’ or ‘nest’) aims at identifying the need for and making changes to a person’s environment and surroundings. It works alongside other treatments to make improvements to a person’s well being, housing, money management, personal relationships, work and other factors. The aim of nidotherapy is not to change the person (whereas other psychological therapies often aim to make changes in an individual’s behaviour, emotions and thinking) but to create a better ‘fit’ between the environment and the individual. As a consequence the individual may improve, but this is not a direct result of treatment but because a more harmonious relationship has been created with the environment. Benefits of nidotherapy may include improvements in people’s relationships, self‐esteem, taking their medication, mental health and generally creating a better life situation. If environmental factors or someone’s surroundings are at all responsible for causing illness and relapse, then nidotherapists and people with schizophrenia can identify these factors together to try and reduce the number and severity of relapses. This review includes one small pilot study with 52 participants. The study compared nidotherapy with standard care versus standard care alone and lasted 18 months. Findings suggest some limited evidence that those who received nidotherapy might experience a slight improvement in social functioning or personal relationships, mental state and may spend less time as inpatients in hospital over the course of 12 months, but there is no information concerning the appropriateness of this for the individual. However, these limited findings need to be treated with considerable caution. The degree of any possible improvements that come from taking part in nidotherapy remain unclear due to the single study’s small sample size, incomplete evidence and risk of bias. No evidence is available on the effect of nidotherapy on general functioning, quality of life, taking medication, satisfaction with treatment, employment status or adverse effects. Further research is required to fill this gap in knowledge about the effectiveness, benefits and possible hazards of nidotherapy. Until such a time, people with mental health problems, health professionals, managers and policymakers should consider this new therapy an experimental one.

AB: Abstract - Background A large proportion of patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to first‐line medication interventions, despite evidence of the effectiveness of these agents. Objectives To assess the effects of medication versus placebo augmentation in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders who have failed to respond adequately to first‐line drug therapies. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) specialised registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched on 3/8/2005, , MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2005) and PsycINFO (1966 to 2005, Part A). Unpublished trials were identified through the Controlled Trials database and the National Institute of Health's Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) service (1972 to 2005). Additional studies in any language were sought in reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the medication augmentation of pharmacotherapy for treatment resistant anxiety disorders. Data collection and analysis Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by class of augmentation agent and anxiety disorder. Overall effect estimates were calculated using a random‐effects model, heterogeneity was assessed and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Main results Twenty eight short‐term (average of seven weeks) randomised controlled trials (740 participants) were included in the review, 20 of which investigated augmentation of medication for treatment‐resistant obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Summary statistics for responder status from nine trials demonstrate overall superiority of a variety of medication agents to placebo (relative risk of non‐response (RR) 3.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.23). Similarly, symptom severity was significantly reduced in the medication groups, relative to placebo (number of trials (N) = 14 ,  standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.36). There is no evidence of a difference between medication and placebo in total dropout rate, or in the number of dropouts due to adverse events. Authors' conclusions Medication augmentation can be an effective and well‐tolerated short‐term treatment strategy for non‐responders to first‐line pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders. However, any conclusions must be tentative in view of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, and the fact that much of the relevant database is based on antipsychotic augmentation trials in OCD patients resistant to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Additional data are needed to address several areas, including the efficacy of augmentation over the longer‐term, and the value of medication augmentation in comparison to other strategies (eg switching medication, adding psychotherapy). Plain language summary Medication augmentation for treatment‐resistant anxiety disorders Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and result in substantial socio‐economic and personal costs. A significant proportion of patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to first‐line medication interventions. This was a systematic review of 28 short‐term randomised controlled trials of medication augmentation for the treatment of such individuals (740 participants). A significantly larger proportion of patients responded to medication (31.8%) than to placebo (13.6%), (nine trials, 250 participants). Symptom severity was also significantly reduced (14 trials, 337 participants). A substantial proportion of the efficacy evidence base was for the augmentation with antipsychotics of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for obsessive compulsive disorder.

AB: Abstract - Background An advance directive is a document specifying a person's preferences for treatment, should he or she lose capacity to make such decisions in the future. They have been used in end‐of‐life settings to direct care but should be well suited to the mental health setting. Objectives To examine the effects of advance treatment directives for people with severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2008), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1 2008), BIOSIS (1985 to February 2008), CINAHL (1982 to February 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), PsycINFO (1872 to February 2008), as well as SCISEARCH and Google ‐ Internet search engine (February 2008). We inspected relevant references and contacted first authors of included studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving adults with severe mental illness, comparing any form of advance directive with standard care for health service and clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence interval again using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We were able to include two trials involving 321 people with severe mental illnesses. There was no significant difference in hospital admission (n=160, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 0.5 to 1.0), or number of psychiatric outpatient attendances between participants given advanced treatment directives or usual care. Similarly, no significant differences were found for compliance with treatment, self harm or number of arrests. Participants given advanced treatment directives needed less use of social workers time (n=160, 1 RCT, WMD ‐106.00 CI ‐156.2 to ‐55.8) than the usual care group, and violent acts were also lower in the advanced directives group (n=160, 1 RCT, RR 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 8 CI 6 to 92). The number of people leaving the study early were not different between groups (n=321, 2 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.6 to 1.6). The addition of 11 studies to awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Authors' conclusions There are too few data available to make definitive recommendations. More intensive forms of advance directive appear to show promise, but currently practice must be guided by evidence other than that derived from randomised trials. More trials are indicated to determine whether higher intensity interventions, such as joint crisis planning, have an effect on outcomes of clinical relevance. Plain language summary Advance treatment directives for people with severe mental illness An advance treatment directive is a document that specifies a person’s future preferences for treatment, should he or she lose the mental ability to make treatment decisions (lose capacity). They have traditionally been used to stipulate treatment in end‐of‐life situations. However, people with mental health problems can also have periods where they are unable to make treatment decisions, and an advance statement could help with choosing suitable medication, saying who should look after children and specifying choices in other areas of their life and treatment. This review looks at whether having an advance statement leads to less hospitalisation (either voluntary or involuntary), less contact with mental health services and whether there is an improvement in general functioning. Two studies were found, involving 321 people. Both took place in England. One trial involved the person concerned making a joint crisis plan in collaboration with the psychiatrist, care coordinator and project worker (high intensity), while the other required filling in a booklet called ‘preferences for care’ (low intensity). Both studies were compared to the usual care in the area concerned. Since the interventions were quite different, and not all outcomes were measured by both studies, it is quite difficult to compare the trials. Those who filled in the booklet showed no decrease in admission to hospital (voluntary or involuntary) or contact with out‐patient services, when compared to usual care. The high intensity group showed no differences in voluntary admissions compared to those in usual care, but were less likely to be hospitalised involuntarily, or assessed under the Mental Health Act. They were also less likely to be violent. There was no difference in use of psychiatric out‐patient services by those in the intervention groups. These are small studies and more research is needed, but it is suggested that using an advance treatment directive could be an alternative to community treatment orders.     (Plain language summary prepared for this review by Janey Antoniou of RETHINK, UK  www.rethink.org )

AB: Abstract - Background Childhood and adolescent mental health problems are a serious and growing concern worldwide. Research suggests that psychotherapy can have a significant and positive impact on children and adolescents with mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders, depression and conduct disorders. Client feedback tools serve as a method of monitoring clients' progress and providing feedback from clients to therapists during the therapeutic process. These tools may help to enhance clinicians' decision‐making by allowing them to adapt their treatment plans as the therapy progresses, resulting in a reduction of treatment failures. Research has shown that client feedback tools have a positive effect on adults' psychotherapy. This review addresses whether feedback tools in child and adolescent therapy could help therapists to better treat their young clients. Objectives To assess the effects of client feedback in psychological therapy on child and adolescent mental health outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR, Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (1946‐), Embase (1974‐) and PsycINFO (1967‐) to 3 April 2018. We did not apply any restriction on date, language or publication status to the search. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared client feedback to no client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed references for inclusion eligibility and extracted outcome, risk of bias and study characteristics data into customised forms. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and calculated their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs), or standardised mean differences (SMDs) if different scales were used to measure the same outcome. We used a random‐effects model for all analyses. Main results We included six published RCTs, conducted in the USA (5 RCTs) and Israel (1 RCT), with 1097 children and adolescents (11 to 18 years old), in the review. We are very uncertain about the effect of client feedback on improvement of symptoms, as reported by youth in the short term because we considered evidence to be of very low‐certainty due to high risk of bias and very serious inconsistency in the effect estimates from the different studies. Similarly, we are very uncertain about the effect of client feedback on treatment acceptability, due to high risk of bias, imprecision in the results, and indirectness of measuring the outcome (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.61; 2 studies, 237 participants; very low‐certainty). Overall, most studies reported and carried out randomisation and allocation concealment adequately. None of the studies were blinded or attempted to blind participants and personnel and were at high risk of performance bias, and only one study had blind outcome assessors. All of the studies were at high or unclear risk of attrition bias mainly due to poor, non‐transparent reporting of participants' flow through the studies. Authors' conclusions Due to the paucity of high‐quality data and considerable inconsistency in results from different studies, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach any firm conclusions regarding the role of client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents with mental health problems, and further research on this important topic is needed. Future studies should avoid risks of performance, detection and attrition biases, as seen in the studies included in this review. Studies from countries other than the USA are needed, as well as studies including children younger than 10 years. Plain language summary Client feedback in psychological therapy for children and adolescents with mental health problems Why is this review important? Systematic feedback from clients to psychotherapists may improve outcomes of psychological therapy. Typically, client feedback is provided regularly throughout the course of therapy. Clients fill in a questionnaire about how they feel about the therapy and how they are feeling in general. The questionnaire is then scored and reviewed by the therapist. The idea is that the therapist will use the feedback to adjust the therapy process, aiming to improve the client‐therapist and client‐therapy fit and, ultimately, client involvement, treatment response and outcomes. There is empirical evidence for the use of client feedback in adult psychotherapy to improve outcomes and response, but there is limited knowledge about this practice in children and adolescents. This review can provide a better understanding of the current role of client feedback in psychotherapy for children and adolescents, as well as future directions that promote evidence‐based practice in child and adolescent psychotherapy. Who will be interested in this review? Psychotherapists working with children and adolescents, policy makers, children and adolescents with mental health problems, and their caregivers and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? Some research suggests that client feedback has a positive impact on outcomes of psychotherapy with adults. We do not know whether client feedback works with children and adolescents. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials, where children and adolescents with mental health problems were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive either psychotherapy with client feedback or standard psychotherapy. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 3 April 2018, and found six (with a total of 1097 children and adolescents) that met our inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have been few investigations of client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents with mental health problems. Most of them were carried out in the USA with older children and adolescents (11 to 18 years old). There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of client feedback in psychological therapy for children and adolescents. What should happen next? It cannot be ruled out that client feedback has positive effects on psychotherapy outcomes in children and adolescents. High‐quality studies are needed to provide sufficient evidence. Future studies should also include younger children, and should take place in countries other than the USA.

AB: Abstract - Background The number of people living with dementia is increasing rapidly. Clinical dementia does not develop suddenly, but rather is preceded by a period of cognitive decline beyond normal age‐related change. People at this intermediate stage between normal cognitive function and clinical dementia are often described as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Considerable research and clinical efforts have been directed toward finding disease‐modifying interventions that may prevent or delay progression from MCI to clinical dementia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of at least 12 weeks of computerised cognitive training (CCT) on maintaining or improving cognitive function and preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched to 31 May 2018 in ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ) and ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO portal/ICTRP ( www.apps.who.int/trialsearch ) to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in which cognitive training via interactive computerised technology was compared with an active or inactive control intervention. Experimental computerised cognitive training (CCT) interventions had to adhere to the following criteria: minimum intervention duration of 12 weeks; any form of interactive computerised cognitive training, including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality. Participants were adults with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), or otherwise at high risk of cognitive decline. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included RCTs. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to describe the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results Eight RCTs with a total of 660 participants met review inclusion criteria. Duration of the included trials varied from 12 weeks to 18 months. Only one trial used an inactive control. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in several domains. Overall, our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by very low‐quality evidence. Almost all results were very imprecise; there were also problems related to risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and indirectness of the evidence. No trial provided data on incident dementia. For comparisons of CCT with both active and inactive controls, the quality of evidence on our other primary outcome of global cognitive function immediately after the intervention period was very low. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about this outcome. Due to very low quality of evidence, we were also unable to determine whether there was any effect of CCT compared to active control on our secondary outcomes of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, depression, functional performance, and mortality. We found low‐quality evidence suggesting that there is probably no effect on speed of processing (SMD 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies; 119 participants), verbal fluency (SMD ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.76 to 0.44; 3 studies; 150 participants), or quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI ‐1.85 to 2.65; 1 study; 19 participants). When CCT was compared with inactive control, we obtained data on five secondary outcomes, including episodic memory, executive function, verbal fluency, depression, and functional performance. We found very low‐quality evidence; therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about these outcomes. Authors' conclusions Currently available evidence does not allow us to determine whether or not computerised cognitive training will prevent clinical dementia or improve or maintain cognitive function in those who already have evidence of cognitive impairment. Small numbers of trials, small samples, risk of bias, inconsistency between trials, and highly imprecise results mean that it is not possible to derive any implications for clinical practice, despite some observed large effect sizes from individual studies. Direct adverse events are unlikely to occur, although the time and sometimes the money involved in computerised cognitive training programmes may represent significant burdens. Further research is necessary and should concentrate on improving methodological rigour, selecting suitable outcomes measures, and assessing generalisability and persistence of any effects. Trials with long‐term follow‐up are needed to determine the potential of this intervention to reduce the risk of dementia. Plain language summary Computerised cognitive training for preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment Background The terms 'cognition' and 'cognitive function' describe all of the mental activities related to thinking, learning, remembering, and communicating. There are normal changes in cognition with age, There are also diseases that affect cognition, principally dementia, in which cognition is impaired to the point of affecting a person's ability to manage daily activities. More common than dementia is a condition often described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in which mild impairment of cognition, more than expected from age alone, can be detected on testing, but by which daily functioning is largely unaffected. For some people, MCI is a stage on the way to developing dementia. There is a lot of interest in anything that might prevent further decline in cognition in people with MCI. One thing that has been suggested as a means of doing this is computerised cognitive training (CCT). Cognitive training consists of a set of standardised tasks intended to 'exercise the brain' in various ways. These days, cognitive training exercises are often delivered via computers or mobile technology, so that people can do them on their own at home. We wanted to know whether CCT is an effective way for people with MCI to maintain their cognitive function and reduce their risk of going on to develop dementia. What we did We searched the medical literature up to 15 March 2018 for trials in which a group of people with MCI had participated in CCT for at least 12 weeks and had been compared with another group that had not received any CCT. This 'control' group could have taken part in an alternative activity instead, or group members could have received no intervention at all. For the comparison to be as fair as possible, it should have been decided at random whether people were in the CCT or control group. We were primarily interested in whether study participants developed dementia and in their overall cognitive function, but we also looked for evidence on particular cognitive skills, daily activities, quality of life, mood, or mental well‐being, and any harmful effects. What we found We found eight trials with 660 participants to include in the review. Seven of the trials (623 participants) compared CCT to an alternative activity. None of the included trials examined development of dementia, so this review presents no evidence on whether taking part in computerised cognitive training will help to prevent dementia. Our main finding in relation to all of the other outcomes in which we were interested was that the overall quality of the evidence was very low. This very low quality was mainly due to small sample sizes, problems with study methods, and differences between trials. Therefore, although we found some evidence for a few benefits of CCT for cognition, we were highly uncertain about study results and consider it likely that future research might lead to different results. Our conclusions Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to answer our review question with any certainty. We think it remains an important area for further study. We would like to see larger studies, which would be more able to detect effects of CCT, and longer studies, which are needed to show whether there are any benefits, whether benefits are long‐lasting, and whether there is a chance of preventing or delaying the development of dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Horticultural therapy is defined as the process of utilising fruits, vegetables, flowers and plants facilitated by a trained therapist or healthcare provider, to achieve specific treatment goals or to simply improve a person's well‐being. It can be used for therapy or rehabilitation programs for cognitive, physical, social, emotional, and recreational benefits, thus improving the person's body, mind and spirit. Between 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication, and may also develop undesirable adverse effects, horticultural therapy may be of value for these people. Objectives To evaluate the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared with standard care or other additional psychosocial interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (Janurary 2013) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing horticultural therapy plus standard care with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) and for binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results We included one single blind study (total n = 24). The overall risk of bias in the study was considered to be unclear although the randomisation was adequate. It compared a package of horticultural therapy which consisted of one hour per day of horticultural activity plus standard care with standard care alone over two weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. Only two people were lost to follow‐up in the study, both in the horticultural therapy group (1 RCT n = 24,RR 5.00 95% CI 0.27 to 94.34,  very low quality evidence ). There was no clear evidence of a difference in Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI‐C) change scores between groups, however confidence intervals were wide (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐0.90 95% CI ‐10.35 to 8.55,  very low quality evidence ). At the end of treatment, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) change scores in horticultural therapy group were greater than that in the control group (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐23.70 CI ‐35.37 to ‐ 12.03, very low quality evidence). The only included study did not report on adverse effects of interventions. Authors' conclusions Based on the current very low quality data, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. This therapy remains unproven and more and larger randomised trials are needed to increase high quality evidence in this area. Plain language summary Gardening activity as a therapy for schizophrenia Horticultural therapy is based on the therapeutic value of participating in garden activities such as growing fruit or vegetables and/or flowers. Gardening is thought to improve people's well‐being through being a recreational and sociable activity which may lead to improvements in people's thinking, new friendships and more positive emotions. The benefits of gardening can also apply to people with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. Gardening reduces stress, which is important because stress can often lead to mental illness. Gardening is also hard work and a physical activity, and so motivates people with mental illness who often feel tired and apathetic. Weight gain is common for people with mental illness and gardening is good physical exercise. Since 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia experience symptoms in spite of taking antipsychotic drugs and also because these drugs have debilitating side effects, horticultural therapy may be of value to these people. This review focuses on the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. An electronic search for relevant randomised trials was run in January 2013. Only one trial was included, it randomised a total of 24 people with schizophrenia to received either their standard care plus horticultural therapy or standard care only. The trial only lasted 2 weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. There are few results and the quality of evidence was rated by the review authors to be  very low quality.  Some of the information from this one study favoured horticultural therapy but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. More large, better conducted and reported trials are required to determine the effectiveness and benefits of horticultural therapy.

AB: Abstract - Background Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine its efficacy as an adjunct to standard‐care treatment. Objectives To examine the effects of yoga versus standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2012 and January 29, 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga to standard‐care control. Data collection and analysis The review team independently selected studies, quality rated these, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed mixed‐effect and fixed‐effect models for analyses. We examined data for heterogeneity (I 2  technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results We included eight studies in the review. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There were clear differences in a number of outcomes in favour of the yoga group, although these were based on one study each, with the exception of leaving the study early. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 to 0.88, medium‐quality evidence), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 to 1, medium‐quality evidence), quality of life (average change 36‐Item Short Form Survey (SF‐36) quality‐of‐life subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 to 26.73, low‐quality evidence), and leaving the study early (8 RCTs, n = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 to 1.37, medium‐quality evidence ) . For the outcome of physical health, there was not a clear difference between groups (average change SF‐36 physical‐health subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI ‐2.44 to 15.64, low‐quality evidence). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. This review was subject to a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included global state, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions Even though we found some positive evidence in favour of yoga over standard‐care control, this should be interpreted cautiously in view of outcomes largely based each on one study with limited sample sizes and short‐term follow‐up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality ‐ ‐too weak to indicate that yoga is superior to standard‐care control for the management of schizophrenia. Plain language summary Yoga versus standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga effective as an add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia? Background Yoga comes from ancient India and involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise, improving strength, flexibility, co‐ordination, endurance, and breathing control and concentration. Yoga has also been shown to reduce stress and promote health and feelings of well‐being. Yoga has been used as a complementary therapy for many health conditions, including improving blood pressure control as well as mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Some research suggests that yoga could also be of benefit as an add‐on treatment to reduce the complex symptoms of schizophrenia (such as hearing voices, seeing things, lack of interest in people and activities, tiredness, loss of emotions and withdrawal) and improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga and its use specifically for people with schizophrenia is under‐researched. Study characteristics We included eight short‐term studies (less than six months) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga or standard care in this review. The yoga programmes described varied from 45 minutes to 1 hour in length, and from 8 sessions to a maximum of 36 sessions. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register in January 2015. All studies continued prescribed antipsychotic treatment for the participants. Key results Some results suggest that yoga may be beneficial for people with schizophrenia. Yoga may be beneficial to mental state, social functioning and quality of life but the available evidence is weak and needs to be treated with a good degree of caution. No adverse effects were found by the one trial that reported this outcome. Several other important outcomes were not addressed by the studies, including changes in cognition, economic considerations, and daily living activities. There was not enough good‐quality evidence in this review to claim that yoga should be prescribed as an add‐on to standard care for schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short‐term follow‐up was reported. More, larger, and long‐term trials that focus on important outcomes are therefore necessary. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation. http://mcpin.org/

AB: Abstract - Background Delirium is defined as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition with reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention, and reduced orientation to the environment. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long‐term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society. Objectives To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in‐hospital mortality, the number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days, ventilator‐free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018). Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. Data collection and analysis We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta‐analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively. Main results The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non‐pharmacologic intervention. Haloperidol versus placebo (two RCTs, 1580 participants) The event rate of ICU delirium was measured in one study including 1439 participants. No difference was identified between groups, (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.17) (moderate‐quality evidence). Haloperidol versus placebo neither reduced or increased in‐hospital mortality, (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 2 studies; 1580 participants (moderate‐quality evidence)); the number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days, (mean difference (MD) ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.37 to 0.17; 2 studies, 1580 participants (moderate‐quality of evidence)); number of ventilator‐free days (mean 23.8 (MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.93 to 0.33) 1 study; 1439 participants, (high‐quality evidence)); length of ICU stay, (MD 0.18, 95% CI ­0.60 to 0.97); 2 studies, 1580 participants; high‐quality evidence). None of the studies measured cognitive impairment. In one study there were three serious adverse events in the intervention group and five in the placebo group; in the other there were five serious adverse events and three patients died, one in each group. None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to interventions received (moderate‐quality evidence). Physical and cognitive therapy interventions (one study, 65 participants) The study did not measure the event rate of ICU delirium. A physical and cognitive therapy intervention versus standard care neither reduced nor increased in‐hospital mortality, (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.20, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence); the number of delirium‐ and coma‐free days, (MD ‐2.8, 95% CI ‐10.1 to 4.6, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence); the number of ventilator‐free days (within the first 28/30 days) was median 27.4 (IQR 0 to 29.2) and 25 (IQR 0 to 28.9); 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence, length of ICU stay, (MD 1.23, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 3.14, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low‐quality evidence); cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE: Mini‐Mental State Examination with higher scores indicating better function, (MD 0.97, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 2.13, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low‐quality evidence); or measured by the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) with lower scores indicating better function (MD ‐8.76, 95% CI ‐19.06 to 1.54, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low‐quality evidence). One patient experienced acute back pain accompanied by hypotensive urgency during physical therapy. Authors' conclusions There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future. Plain language summary Intervention to prevent delirium for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) Background Delirium is an acutely disturbed state of mind that occurs in critically ill adults in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated with a prolonged time on mechanical ventilation to assist breathing, longer stay in the ICU and hospital, and higher risk of death. ICU delirium is also linked with cognitive problems such as loss of memory and attention, difficulty in concentrating and reduced awareness. The risk factors for delirium include old age, alcoholism, vision/hearing impairment and, for critically ill patients, the use of restraints, prolonged pain and some medications. Review question Our aim was to assess the existing evidence on the effect of interventions for preventing ICU delirium, reducing in‐hospital death, reducing length of coma/delirium, the need for mechanical ventilation to assist breathing, the length of stay in the ICU and mental problems Study characteristics We included 12 randomized controlled trials (3885 participants) in our review. The studies included adults aged 48 to 70 years from surgical and medical ICUs. The studies compared different drugs (three studies) various approaches to sedation (five studies), physical or cognitive therapy or both (one study), noise and light reduction in the ICU (two studies), and preventive nursing care (one study). The studies had mostly small numbers of participants and did not blind the researchers who assessed effects on outcomes. We report the findings regarding the effect of the two most commonly explored approaches for preventing delirium, drug and non‐drug interventions, haloperidol versus a sham drug, and early physical and cognitive therapy versus usual care. Key results Our findings suggest that there may be little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium, but further studies are needed to reduce imprecision and increase our confidence in the findings. More studies of physical and cognitive therapy are needed as there is insufficient evidence to determine whether these non‐pharmacological approaches can prevent delirium in the ICU. Additional research is required to explore the benefits and harms of other approaches to prevent delirium in the ICU such as sedation and changes in the ICU environment, and nursing care tailored to prevent delirium. Quality of the evidence We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate to very low. Several studies had quality shortcomings, including their use of small numbers of participants, and lack of blinding of those assessing effects of interventions for preventing delirium and other outcomes. For the interventions testing sedation approaches, physical and cognitive therapy, and changes in the environment, additional research is required to clarify their effectiveness. The five studies in ‘Studies awaiting classification’ and 15 ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once they are completed and assessed.

AB: Abstract - Background Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that originated in India and is currently accepted in the Western world as a form of relaxation and exercise. It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia as an alternative or adjunctive treatment. Objectives To systematically assess the effects of yoga versus non‐standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialised Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia and comparing yoga with non‐standard care. We included trials that met our selection criteria and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis The review team independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect models for analyses. We examined data for heterogeneity (I 2  technique), assessed risk of bias for included studies, and created a 'Summary of findings’ table for seven main outcomes of interest using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results We were able to include six studies (586 participants). Non‐standard care consisted solely of another type of exercise programme. All outcomes were short term (less than six months). There was a clear difference in the outcome leaving the study early (6 RCTs, n=586, RR 0.64 CI 0.49 to 0.83,  medium quality evidence ) in favour of the yoga group. There were no clear differences between groups for the remaining outcomes. These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.81 CI 0.62 to 1.07,  low quality evidence ), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n=84, RR 0.90 CI 0.78 to 1.04,  low quality evidence ), quality of life (mental health) (average change 36‐Item Short Form Survey (SF‐36) quality‐of‐life sub‐scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD ‐5.30 CI ‐17.78 to 7.18,  low quality evidence ), physical health, (average change WHOQOL‐BREF physical‐health sub‐scale, 1 RCT, n=69, MD 9.22 CI ‐0.42 to 18.86,  low quality evidence ). Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. There were a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included relapse, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living. Authors' conclusions We found minimal differences between yoga and non‐standard care, the latter consisting of another exercise comparator, which could be broadly considered aerobic exercise. Outcomes were largely based on single studies with limited sample sizes and short‐term follow‐up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality ‐ too weak to indicate that yoga is superior or inferior to non‐standard care control for management of people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Yoga versus non‐standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga an effective add‐on treatment compared to other add‐on treatments for people with schizophrenia? Background Yoga comes from ancient India and involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise, improving strength, flexibility, co‐ordination, endurance, and breathing control and concentration. Yoga has also been shown to reduce stress and promote health and feelings of well‐being.

The effectiveness of yoga versus other available (non‐drug and non‐talking therapy) add‐on treatments is under‐researched. Searching for evidence We ran electronic searches for trials (latest search was in March 2017) for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive yoga or another add‐on treatment. One thousand and thirty four records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found Six trials with 586 participants met the review requirements and provided useable data. Other add‐on treatments consisted of other forms of exercise only. There is little evidence currently available, is low quality, and suggests that yoga is no more effective than other add‐on treatments for schizophrenia. Conclusions Current evidence from randomised controlled trials shows yoga is no more effective than other add on treatments for schizophrenia, but the only available comparators to yoga were other forms of exercise. The evidence is weak as the number of studies available was small, and only short‐term follow‐up was reported. More, larger, and long‐term trials that compare yoga with other alternatives to exercise are therefore necessary.

AB: Abstract - Background Panic disorder is characterised by repeated, unexpected panic attacks, which represent a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes, and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. It is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology consider antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as the first‐line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Several classes of antidepressants have been studied and compared, but it is still unclear which antidepressants have a more or less favourable profile in terms of effectiveness and acceptability in the treatment of this condition. Objectives To assess the effects of antidepressants for panic disorder in adults, specifically: 1. to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison to placebo; 2. to review the acceptability of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with placebo; and 3. to investigate the adverse effects of antidepressants in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, including the general prevalence of adverse effects, compared to placebo. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders' (CCMD) Specialised Register, and CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to May 2017. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. Selection criteria All double‐blind, randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) allocating adults with panic disorder to antidepressants or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. We entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double‐check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and settings. Primary outcomes included failure to respond, measured by a range of response scales, and treatment acceptability, measured by total number of dropouts for any reason. Secondary outcomes included failure to remit, panic symptom scales, frequency of panic attacks, agoraphobia, general anxiety, depression, social functioning, quality of life and patient satisfaction, measured by various scales as defined in individual studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome Main results Forty‐one unique RCTs including 9377 participants overall, of whom we included 8252 in the 49 placebo‐controlled arms of interest (antidepressant as monotherapy and placebo alone) in this review. The majority of studies were of moderate to low quality due to inconsistency, imprecision and unclear risk of selection and performance bias. We found low‐quality evidence that revealed a benefit for antidepressants as a group in comparison with placebo in terms of efficacy measured as failure to respond (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.79; participants = 6500; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 6 to 9): that means seven people would need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. We observed the same finding when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo. Moderate‐quality evidence suggested a benefit for antidepressants compared to placebo when looking at number of dropouts due to any cause (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; participants = 7850; studies = 30). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a NNTB of 27 (95% CI 17 to 105); treating 27 people will result in one person fewer dropping out. Considering antidepressant classes, TCAs showed a benefit over placebo, while for SSRIs and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) we observed no difference. When looking at dropouts due to adverse effects, which can be considered as a measure of tolerability, we found moderate‐quality evidence showing that antidepressants as a whole are less well tolerated than placebo. In particular, TCAs and SSRIs produced more dropouts due to adverse effects in comparison with placebo, while the confidence interval for SNRI, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (NRI) and other antidepressants were wide and included the possibility of no difference. Authors' conclusions The identified studies comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. Based on these results, antidepressants may be more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder. Efficacy can be quantified as a NNTB of 7, implying that seven people need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit. Antidepressants may also have benefit in comparison with placebo in terms of number of dropouts, but a less favourable profile in terms of dropout due to adverse effects. However, the tolerability profile varied between different classes of antidepressants. The choice of whether antidepressants should be prescribed in clinical practice cannot be made on the basis of this review. Limitations in results include funding of some studies by pharmaceutical companies, and only assessing short‐term outcomes. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta‐analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue. Plain language summary Antidepressants for panic disorder in adults Why is this review important? Panic disorder is common in the general population. It is characterised by panic attacks, periods of fear or anxiety with a rapid onset in which other characteristic symptoms are experienced (involving bodily systems and fearful thoughts). The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Among pharmacological interventions, the standard treatment suggested by guidelines is different classes of antidepressants. Evidence for their effectiveness and acceptability is unclear. Who will be interested in this review? People with panic disorder and general practitioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? How effective are antidepressants compared to a sham treatment (known as placebo) in treating panic disorder? What is the acceptability of antidepressants compared to placebo in treating panic disorder? How many unintended and untoward effects (adverse effects) do antidepressants have compared to placebo in people with panic disorder? Which studies were included in the review? We searched electronic databases to find all relevant studies. The medical studies included in the review compared treatment with antidepressants or placebo in adults with a diagnosis of panic disorder. The studies also had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which means adults were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive the treatment or placebo. We included 41 RCTs for a total of 9377 people in the review. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We found evidence showing that antidepressants are better than placebo in terms of effectiveness and number of people leaving the study early. However, our findings also showed that antidepressants are less well tolerated than placebo, producing more dropouts due to adverse effects. Results are limited in the following ways: some studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and only short‐term outcomes were assessed. We found almost no data on other clinically relevant outcomes, such as functioning and quality of life. The quality of the available evidence ranged from very low to high. What should happen next? Studies with outcomes assessed at longer‐term follow‐up visits should be carried out to establish whether the effect is transient or maintained. Trials should better report any harms experienced by participants during the trial. In addition, a further analysis with an approach called 'network meta‐analysis' will include all psychopharmacological treatments available for panic disorder, and will likely shed further light on this compelling issue, also being able to provide more information with regard to comparative efficacy of different available interventions.

AB: Abstract - Background Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems. They are chronic and unremitting. Effective treatments are available, but access to services is limited. Media‐delivered behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions (self‐help) aim to deliver treatment with less input from professionals compared with traditional therapies. Objectives To assess the effects of media‐delivered behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapies for anxiety disorders in adults. Search methods Published and unpublished studies were considered without restriction by language or date. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR) was searched all years to 1 January 2013. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases:  The Cochrane Library  (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Complementary searches were carried out on Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 23 February 2013) and PsycINFO (1987 to February, Week 2, 2013), together with International trial registries (the trials portal of the World Health Organization ( ICTRP ) and  ClinicalTrials.gov ). Reference lists from previous meta‐analyses and reports of randomised controlled trials were checked, and authors were contacted for unpublished data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of media‐delivered behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapy in adults with anxiety disorders (other than post‐traumatic stress disorder) compared with no intervention (including attention/relaxation controls) or compared with face‐to‐face therapy. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted in duplicate. Outcomes were combined using random‐effects models, and tests for heterogeneity and for small study bias were conducted. We examined subgroup differences by type of disorder, type of intervention provided, type of media, and recruitment methods used. Main results One hundred and one studies with 8403 participants were included; 92 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. These trials compared several types of media‐delivered interventions (with varying levels of support) with no treatment and with face‐to‐face interventions. Inconsistency and risk of bias reduced our confidence in the overall results. For the primary outcome of symptoms of anxiety, moderate‐quality evidence showed medium effects compared with no intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.80; 72 studies, 4537 participants), and low‐quality evidence of small effects favoured face‐to‐face therapy (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐0.36 to ‐0.09; 24 studies, 1360 participants). The intervention was associated with greater response than was seen with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.34, 95% CI 1.81 to 3.03; 21 studies, 1547 participants) and was not significantly inferior to face‐to‐face therapy in these studies (RR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.56 to 1.09; 10 studies, 575 participants), but the latter comparison included versions of therapies that were not as comprehensive as those provided in routine clinical practice. Evidence suggested benefit for secondary outcome measures (depression, mental‐health related disability, quality of life and dropout), but this evidence was of low to moderate quality. Evidence regarding harm was lacking. Authors' conclusions Self‐help may be useful for people who are not able or are not willing to use other services for people with anxiety disorders; for people who can access it, face‐to‐face cognitive behavioural therapy is probably clinically superior. Economic analyses were beyond the scope of this review. Important heterogeneity was noted across trials. Recent interventions for specific problems that incorporate clinician support may be more effective than transdiagnostic interventions (i.e. interventions for multiple disorders) provided with no guidance, but these issues are confounded in the available trials. Although many small trials have been conducted, the generalisability of their findings is limited. Most interventions tested are not available to consumers. Self‐help has been recommended as the first step in the treatment of some anxiety disorders, but the short‐term and long‐term effectiveness of media‐delivered interventions has not been established. Large, pragmatic trials are needed to evaluate and to maximise the benefits of self‐help interventions. Plain language summary Self‐help for anxiety disorders Anxiety disorders are common. They interfere with normal living, and they tend not to go away without treatment. Effective treatments are available, including cognitive behavioural therapy. These are known to work when delivered in person, but many people cannot access face‐to‐face treatment. This review examined 101 clinical trials of self‐help and statistically analysed 92 of them. In these trials, 8403 people received self‐help or were assigned to a control condition.  Overall, self‐help with some support from a professional appears to be more effective than no treatment. Only half of the people who used self‐help were better at the end of treatment, but self‐help may still be considered effective because people with anxiety do not tend to get better without treatment. Self‐help may be less effective than normal face‐to‐face therapy. Some results were difficult to interpret because the effects of treatments varied and the risk of overestimating the results was serious because of limitations in the study methods. We conclude that self‐help is probably better than no treatment, but many people with an anxiety disorder would get better results from treatment provided by a skilled psychologist. Furthermore, most of the self‐help materials used in these studies are intended for research and are not available to the public, so the results reported here may not apply to commercially available products.

AB: Abstract - Background The amelioration of psychological distress following traumatic events is a major concern. Systematic reviews suggest that interventions targeted at all of those exposed to such events are not effective at preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently other forms of intervention have been developed with the aim of treating acute traumatic stress problems. Objectives To perform a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of all psychological treatments and interventions commenced within three months of a traumatic event aimed at treating acute traumatic stress reactions. The review followed the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Search methods Systematic searches were performed of of CCDAN Registers up to August 2008. Editions of key journals were searched by hand over a period of two years; personal communication was undertaken with key experts in the field; online discussion fora were searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of any psychological intervention or treatment designed to reduce acute traumatic stress symptoms, with the exception of single session interventions. Data collection and analysis Data were entered and analysed for summary effects using Review Manager 5.0 software. Standardised mean differences were calculated for continuous variable outcome data. Relative risks were calculated for dichotomous outcome data. When statistical heterogeneity was present a random effects model was applied. Main results Fifteen studies (two with long term follow‐up studies) were identified examining a range of interventions. In terms of main findings, twelve studies evaluated brief trauma focused cognitive behavioural interventions (TF‐CBT). TF‐CBT was more effective than a waiting list intervention (6 studies, 471 participants; SMD ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐1.06, ‐0.23) and supportive counselling (4 studies, 198 participants; SMD ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐1.12, ‐0.23). Effects against supportive counselling were still present at 6 month follow‐up (4 studies, 170 participants; SMD ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐1.02, ‐0.25). There was no evidence of the effectiveness of a structured writing intervention when compared against minimal intervention (2 studies, 149 participants; SMD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.48, 0.17). Authors' conclusions There was evidence that individual TF‐CBT was effective for individuals with acute traumatic stress symptoms compared to both waiting list and supportive counselling interventions. The quality of trials included was variable and sample sizes were often small. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity in the included studies and unexplained statistical heterogeneity observed in some comparisons. This suggests the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review. Additional high quality trials with longer follow up periods are required to further test TF‐CBT and other forms of psychological intervention. Plain language summary Early psychological interventions to treat acute traumatic stress symptoms Traumatic events can have a significant impact on individuals', families' and communities' abilities to cope. In the past, single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were widely used with the aim of preventing continuing psychological difficulties. However, previous reviews have found that single session individual interventions and interventions provided to all have not been effective at preventing PTSD. A range of other forms of intervention have been developed to try to reduce psychological distress for individuals exposed to trauma. This review evaluated the results of 15 studies that tested a diverse range of psychological interventions aimed at treating acute traumatic stress problems. There was evidence to support the use of trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy with such individuals, although there were a number of potential biases in identified studies which means the results should be treated with some caution. Further research is required to evaluate longer terms effects of TF‐CBT, to explore potential benefits of other forms of intervention and to identify the most effective ways of providing psychological help in the early stages after a traumatic event.

AB: Abstract - Background Treatment of schizophrenia depends heavily on neuroleptic drugs. Hypersalivation is a common side effect when people with schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs. Hypersalivation can be an embarrassing and stigmatising problem, can affect quality of life and can result in discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment. It can also be difficult to treat. Objectives To summarise the best available evidence of the effects of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of non‐clozapine neuroleptic‐induced hypersalivation in people with schizophrenia. Clozapine‐induced hypersalivation has been addressed in another Cochrane review. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (15 November 2012) and inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant studies. We were to contact the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing an anticholinergic drug with placebo, no treatment, another anticholinergic drug or any other intervention. Data collection and analysis We inspected the results of the search to identify relevant studies. We were to extract data onto standard, simple forms. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane risk assessment tool. For binary outcomes, we were to calculate a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we were to estimate the mean difference between groups. Main results The search resulted in four potential studies; after inspection, all were excluded. Three studies were excluded because they involved people with clozapine‐induced hypersalivation ‐ a topic covered in another Cochrane review. The fourth study was excluded because it involved people with schizophrenia, mood disorders or other mental disorders who were suffering from clozapine‐ and non‐clozapine induced hypersalivation and were treated with Chinese medicines with unknown anticholinergic properties. People in the control group received an anticholinergic drug (artane) or an antihistamine (phenergan). It was not possible to separate clozapine‐ from non‐clozapine‐treated people in the intervention group, or to separate artane‐treated people from phenergan‐treated people in the control group. Authors' conclusions We have been unable to locate any studies addressing the question raised in this review. Accordingly, this empty review points out an important clinical problem that needs to be investigated via well‐designed and well‐conducted randomised trials. Clinicians and patients are likely to continue with their current dependence on clinical judgement and personal experience. Policy makers have no trial‐based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of hypersalivation induced by neuroleptics other than clozapine. They are likely to continue to rely on opinion and habit when making recommendations. Funders of studies may wish to make this important subgroup of people a priority in future research. Plain language summary Anticholinergic medication for excessive salivation caused by use of antipsychotics other than clozapine The first line of treatment of schizophrenia is usually antipsychotic drugs. These drugs help in the treatment of the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, these drugs often have serious side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, tiredness, apathy and lack of drive. Dribbling or drooling (hypersalivation) is another common side effect, which frequently occurs at night when asleep. This can be an embarrassing and stigmatising problem that can affect quality of life and cause people to stop their medication, which may result in relapse and going back into hospital. Dribbling and drooling can be difficult to treat; however, anticholinergic drugs can decrease production of saliva and dribbling. This review assessed the evidence for the benefit or harm of anticholinergic drugs used in treating hypersalivation caused by antipsychotic or neuroleptic medication. The review excluded the antipsychotic clozapine, as its role in causing hypersalivation has been the subject of another Cochrane review. The search was carried out 15 November 2012 and resulted in identification of four potential studies, but none could be included. Three of these were excluded because they involved clozapine‐related hypersalivation. The fourth study was excluded because it involved people with mood or other mental disorders and Chinese medicines. Dribbling or hypersalivation is an important problem that needs to be investigated via well‐designed research and randomised trials. Until such time, psychiatrists and patients are likely to continue their treatment of hypersalivation on the basis of daily clinical judgement and personal experience rather than hard evidence. Treatment of hypersalivation caused by antipsychotics or neuroleptics other than clozapine does not seem to have received adequate research attention to help guide practice. The review authors conclude that using anticholinergics to treat dribbling or hypersalivation caused by antipsychotic drugs other than clozapine cannot be justified without further study.

AB: Abstract - Background Penfluridol, available since 1970, is an unusual long acting oral antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. It may be considered a depot medication as it is administered once a week. Objectives To review the effects of penfluridol for treatment of those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses in comparison to placebo, other antipsychotic medication or no intervention. Search methods We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2003‐5) and LILACS (1982‐2005). We hand searched references of all identified studies and sought citations of these studies in the Science Citation Index. We contacted the authors of trials and the manufacturer of penfluridol. We updated this search September 2012 and added eight new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria We reliably selected all randomised clinical trials comparing penfluridol to placebo or typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia or serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted and analysed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data using a random effects model, and where possible calculated the number needed to treat. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data. Main results We included twenty‐five studies with a total of 1024 participants. Most of these studies were undertaken in the 1970s when penfluridol was launched. Ten studies, with 365 patients, compared penfluridol to placebo. In the meta‐analysis of medium‐term lasting studies, penfluridol was superior to placebo in the main efficacy measures: 'improvement in global state' (n=159, 4 RCTs, RR 0.69 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 10) and 'needing additional antipsychotic' (n=138, 5 RCTs, RR 0.43 CI 0.2 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 1.8 to 20). A total of 449 patients from eleven studies were randomised to penfluridol or oral typical antipsychotics. There were no particular differences between penfluridol versus chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, thioridazine, or thiothixene for the main outcome measures in medium‐term trials: 'improvement on global state' (N=2 studies), 'leaving the study early' (N=6), 'needing additional antipsychotic' (N=3), needing antiparkinsonian medication (N=2), and side‐effects. Six studies, with 274 patients, compared penfluridol to depot typical antipsychotics. In general, for the efficacy and safety measures, no differences were established, but penfluridol was superior in keeping the patients in treatment; 'leaving the study early' (n=218, 5RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.3 to 0.97, NNT 6 CI 3.4 to 50). Authors' conclusions Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. The efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. Furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. One of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. It is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. An additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low‐cost intervention. Note: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.

AB: Abstract - Background Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) are common and disabling disorders. Many patients experience difficulties accessing specialist psychological treatments. Pure self‐help (PSH: self‐help material only) or guided self‐help (GSH: self‐help material with therapist guidance), may bridge this gap. Objectives Main objective:   Evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) / controlled clinical trials (CCTs) for the efficacy of PSH/GSH with respect to eating disorder symptoms, compared with waiting list or placebo/attention control, other psychological or pharmacological treatments (or combinations/augmentations) in people with eating disorders. Secondary objective:   Evaluate evidence for the efficacy of PSH/GSH regarding comorbid symptomatology and costs. Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched in November 2005, other electronic databases were searched, relevant journals and grey literature were checked, and personal approaches were made to authors. Selection criteria Published/unpublished RCTs/CCTs evaluating PSH/GSH for any eating disorder. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted using a customized spreadsheet. Relative Risks (RR) were calculated from dichotomous data and weighted/standardized mean differences (WMD/SMD) from continuous data, using a random effects model. Main results Twelve RCTs and three CCTs were identified, all focusing on BN, BED, EDNOS or combinations of these, in adults, using manual‐based PSH/GSH across various settings. Primary comparisons:   At end of treatment, PSH/GSH did not significantly differ from waiting list in abstinence from bingeing (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09), or purging (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08), although these treatments produced greater improvement on other eating disorder symptoms, psychiatric symptomatology and interpersonal functioning but not depression. Compared to other formal psychological therapies, PSH/GSH did not differ significantly at end of treatment or follow‐up in improvement on bingeing and purging (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31), other eating disorder symptoms, level of interpersonal functioning or depression. There were no significant differences in treatment dropout. Secondary comparisons:   One small study in BED found that cognitive‐behavioural GSH compared to a non‐specific control treatment produced significantly greater improvements in abstinence from bingeing and other eating disorder symptoms. Studies comparing PSH with GSH found no significant differences between treatment groups at end of treatment or follow‐up. Comparison between different types of PSH/GSH found significant differences on eating disorder symptoms but not on bingeing/purging abstinence rates. Authors' conclusions PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment and may have potential as an alternative to formal therapist‐delivered psychological therapy. Future research should focus on producing large well‐conducted studies of self‐help treatments in eating disorders including health economic evaluations, different types and modes of delivering self‐help (e.g. computerised versus manual‐based) and different populations and settings. Plain language summary Self‐help and guided self‐help for eating disorders The eating disorders (anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)) are disabling conditions and specialist treatment is not always easily accessible. Self‐help may bridge the gap. This review aimed to evaluate pure self‐help (PSH) and guided self‐help (GSH) interventions for eating disorders for all ages and genders, compared to psychological, pharmacological or control treatments and waiting list. Fifteen trials were identified, all focused on BN, BED or EDNOS, using manual‐based self‐help. There is some evidence that PSH/GSH reduce eating disorder and other symptoms in comparison to waiting list or control treatment and may produce comparable outcomes to formal therapist‐delivered psychological therapies. PSH/GSH may have some utility as a first step in treatment. In the future there need to be large well‐conducted effectiveness studies of self‐help treatments with or without guidance incorporating cost evaluations and investigation of different types of self‐help in different populations and settings.

AB: Abstract - Background Procaine is a controversial substance which has been used for "antiageing" effects including cognitive improvement for more than 50 years. Preparations which contain procaine as a component are claimed to prevent, reverse and interrupt dementia. Several products are widely promoted and can be purchased "over the counter" outside the US and via the Internet. Procaine preparations are said to be readily available in over 70 countries and to be used by more than 100 million people. Objectives To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of procaine (and preparations containing procaine as a component) on cognitive function in the treatment of people with dementia as well as healthy elderly people. Search methods References regarding trials with people with dementia or cognitive impairment were identified from a search  ALOIS : the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 16 April 2010 using the search term: procaine.  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 16 April 2010 to find references to ensure the search was as up‐to‐date and as comprehensive as possible. For more details on what ALOIS contains see  About ALOIS . Selection criteria All human, unconfounded, randomized double‐blind trials in which treatment with procaine was administered for its effects on cognitive function and behavioural symptoms in demented or healthy elderly participants in parallel group comparison with placebo. Data collection and analysis The two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, extracted data, and performed the data analysis. Main results Pooling data from two studies with a total of 415 participants showed a detrimental effect of procaine in terms of causing side effects (20/208 active versus 3/207 placebo, OR 7.30, 95% CI 2.13 to 25.02, P = 0.002). In patients with dementia, a single small study of 12 participants (all women) also suggested a detrimental effect. Two trials referring to healthy elderly persons suggested a positive effect of procaine preparation on cognitive function.  Meta‐analysis of beneficial outcomes was not appropriate due to the different preparations, durations and poor quality of trials. Most trials were performed before the 1990s and none reported any criteria for cognitive decline and dementia. Authors' conclusions This review suggests that the evidence for detrimental effects of procaine and its preparations is stronger than the evidence for benefit in preventing and/or treating dementia or cognitive impairment. There is some evidence from older studies that procaine preparations might improve memory in persons without cognitive impairment. However, the clear evidence of side effects suggests that the risks might outweigh the benefits. In the light of this, the strong marketing claims for procaine preparations should be withdrawn until trials of adequate size, duration and quality have been conducted. Plain language summary Procaine is a controversial substance that has been used for "antiageing" effects including cognitive improvement for more than 50 years Preparations which contain procaine as a component are widely promoted and used in several countries. In analysing the effect of procaine and its preparations from 3 studies with a total of 427 participants, there was no evidence for benefit in the prevention or treatment of dementia or cognitive impairment. There were a few but some serious adverse events related to long‐term use of procaine.

AB: Abstract - Background Jet lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day‐night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re‐align them with the outside world. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet lag after air travel across several time zones. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals 'Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine' and 'Sleep' by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in 'Side Effects of Drugs' (SED) and SED Annuals, 'Reactions Weekly', MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food & Drug Administration. An updating search was carried out on 12/2/2008 but no new studies were identified. Selection criteria Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet lag or related components, such as subjective well being, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms. Data collection and analysis Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment.   Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, 'Reactions Weekly', and in the WHO UMC database. Main results Eight of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet‐lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow‐release melatonin suggests that a short‐lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) is 2, based on the only two trials that gave the necessary data. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important: if it is taken at the wrong time, early in the day, it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local time. The incidence of other side effects is low. Case reports suggest that people with epilepsy, and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatonin. Authors' conclusions Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short‐term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2‐4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation. Plain language summary Melatonin for the prevention and treatment of jet lag Jet lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day‐night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re‐align them with the outside world.

AB: Abstract - Background Collaborative care for severe mental illness (SMI) is a community‐based intervention, which typically consists of a number of components. The intervention aims to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care for people with SMI who are living in the community. The primary outcome of interest was psychiatric admissions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised register in April 2011. The register is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also contacted 51 experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) described as collaborative care by the trialists comparing any form of collaborative care with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI, defined as schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis (e.g. schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders), bipolar affective disorder or other types of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently to extract and quality assess data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed. Main results We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review. We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia. The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care. All results are ' low or very low quality evidence'. Data indicated that collaborative care reduced psychiatric admissions at year two in comparison to standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). The sensitivity analysis showed that the proportion of participants psychiatrically hospitalised was lower in the intervention group than the standard care group in year three: 28% compared to 38% (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99). In comparison to the standard care group, collaborative care significantly improved the Mental Health Component (MHC) of quality of life at the three‐year follow‐up, (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 3.50, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.20). The Physical Health Component (PHC) of the quality of life measure at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.91). Direct intervention (all‐treatment) costs of collaborative care at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly from standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD ‐$2981.00, 95% CI $16934.93 to $10972.93). The proportion of participants leaving the study early did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.79). There is no trial‐based information regarding the effect of collaborative care for people with schizophrenia. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of deaths by suicide at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32), or the number of participants that died from all other causes at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.66). Authors' conclusions The review did not identify any studies relevant to care of people with schizophrenia and hence there is no evidence available to determine if collaborative care is effective for people suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders. There was however one trial at high risk of bias that suggests that collaborative care for US veterans with bipolar disorder may reduce psychiatric admissions at two years and improves quality of life (mental health component) at three years, however, on its own it is not sufficient for us to make any recommendations regarding its effectiveness. More large, well designed, conducted and reported trials are required before any clinical or policy making decisions can be made. Plain language summary Collaborative care approaches for people with severe mental illness Collaborative care aims to improve the physical and mental health of people with severe mental illness (SMI). Common to all definitions is that collaborative care aims to develop closer working relationships between primary care (family doctors or GPs and practice nurses) and specialist health care (such as Community Mental Health Teams). There are different ways in which this can be achieved, making collaborative care very complex. Integrating or joining‐up primary care and mental health services, so that they work better together, is intended to increase communication and joint working between health professionals (e.g. GPs, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists). This is meant to provide a person with severe mental illness with better care, based in the community, which is often a less stigmatised setting than hospital, and that promotion of good practice helps consumers maintain contact with services. A major issue is that many GPs still feel that physical health problems (such as diabetes, heart disease, smoking cessation) are more their concern and see treatment of severe mental illness as the job of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Collaborative care aims to improve overall quality of care by ensuring that healthcare professionals work together, trying to meet the physical and mental health needs of people. The aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in comparison to standard or usual care. An electronic search for trials was carried out in April 2011. The primary focus of interest was admissions to hospital. According to the one included study in this review, collaborative care may be effective in reducing going into hospital (less psychiatric admissions and other admissions). It also helps improve people’s quality of life and mental health. However, all evidence was either low or very low quality and further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with SMI in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better as well as its cost effectiveness.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not respond to an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, one treatment strategy could be to increase the antipsychotic dose; and another strategy could be to switch to a different antipsychotic drug. Objectives To examine the efficacy of increasing the antipsychotic dose versus switching the antipsychotic drug in the treatment of non‐responsive people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose versus switching to a different antipsychotic drug for people with schizophrenia who have not responded to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We include one RCT with relevant data on 29 participants in this review. The trial had a parallel design and was double‐blind, but blinding procedures were not described. The trial included people who were non‐responsive to fluphenazine 20 mg/day administered for 4 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to continuing treatment with fluphenazine 20 mg/day, increasing the dose to fluphenazine 80 mg/day or switching to haloperidol 20 mg/day for four additional weeks. Data were reported only for 47 out of 58 initially randomised participants. The trial was published in 1993. The fact that only one RCT with a small sample size (N = 29) was included in the analysis limits the quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the three available outcomes: global state (number of participants with clinically relevant response (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.17 to 15.99,  very low quality evidence ); general mental state (endpoint score, BPRS total) (MD 2.00, 95% CI −4.20 to 8.20,  very low quality evidence ); and negative symptoms (endpoint score, SANS) (MD 3.40, 95% CI −12.56 to 19.36). No data were reported for leaving the study early, adverse effects, time in hospital, quality of life, satisfaction with care and functioning. Authors' conclusions There is extremely limited evidence and no clear conclusions can be drawn. There is an urgent need for further trials in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Plain language summary Increasing antipsychotic dose versus switching to a different antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to initial treatment Review question If a person with schizophrenia does not initially respond to an antipsychotic, is increasing the dose of this antipsychotic more effective, and safer, compared with switching to another antipsychotic? Background Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia do not respond fully (i.e. symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations still remain) with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians can consider increasing the antipsychotic dose beyond regular thresholds or switching to a different antipsychotic drug in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. The evidence surrounding the optimal treatment strategy is scarce. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia ran an electronic search (up to 30 March 2017) for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia who were not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment to receive either an increased antipsychotic dose or switch to a different antipsychotic drug. Nine hundred and two records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found Only one trial met the review requirements and provided usable data. Data were reported for the number of participants who responded to treatment, the general mental state of participants at endpoint of the trial and the presence of negative symptoms at endpoint. There were no data available for any other outcome. No clear difference between increasing the dose of the antipsychotic drug and switching to a different antipsychotic was shown. The available evidence was extremely limited and of very low quality. Conclusions The results of the present review show that there is no good‐quality evidence to help clinicians decide between increasing the antipsychotic dose or switching to a different antipsychotic drug for people not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Therefore, no clear conclusions can be drawn. Larger, well‐designed trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Poor compliance with treatment often means that many people with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness relapse and may need frequent and repeated hospitalisation. Information and communication technology (ICT) is increasingly being used to deliver information, treatment or both for people with severe mental disorders. Objectives To evaluate the effects of psychoeducational interventions using ICT as a means of educating and supporting people with schizophrenia or related psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (2008, 2009 and September 2010), inspected references of identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICT as a psychoeducational and supportive tool with any other type of psychoeducation and supportive intervention or standard care. Data collection and analysis We selected trials and extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias using the criteria described in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Main results We included six trials with a total of 1063 participants. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes (patient compliance and global state) between psychoeducational interventions using ICT and standard care. Technology‐mediated psychoeducation improved mental state in the short term (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.00; n = 30, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.90 to ‐0.12) but not global state (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.42). Knowledge and insight were not effected (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.15; n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.03). People allocated to technology‐mediated psychoeducation perceived that they received more social support than people allocated to the standard care group (n = 30, 1 RCT, MD 0.42, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.80). When technology‐mediated psychoeducation was used as an adjunct to standard care it did not improve general compliance in the short term (n = 291, 3 RCTs, RR for leaving the study early 0.81, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.19) or in the long term (n = 434, 2 RCTs, RR for leaving the study early 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.25). However, it did improve compliance with medication in the long term (n = 71, 1 RCT, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Adding technology‐mediated psychoeducation on top of standard care did not clearly improve either general mental state, negative or positive symptoms, global state, level of knowledge or quality of life. However, the results were not consistent regarding level of knowledge and satisfaction with treatment. When technology‐mediated psychoeducation plus standard care was compared with patient education not using technology the only outcome reported was satisfaction with treatment. There were no differences between groups. Authors' conclusions Using ICT to deliver psychoeducational interventions has no clear effects compared with standard care, other methods of delivering psychoeducation and support, or both. Researchers used a variety of methods of delivery and outcomes, and studies were few and underpowered. ICT remains a promising method of delivering psychoeducation; the equivocal findings of this review should not postpone high‐quality research in this area. Plain language summary Patient education and support for people with schizophrenia by using information and communication technology Information and Communication Technology (ICT) includes the use of computers, telephones, television and radio, video and audio recordings. It consists of all technical means used to handle information and communication. During the last twenty years there has been a growing trend towards the use of ICT for the delivery of education, treatment and social support for people with mental illness.  Education about illness and treatment has been found to be a good way to increase a person's awareness of their health. ICT has the potential to improve many aspects of overall care, including: better education and social support; improved information and management of illness; increased access to health services; improved quality of care; better contact and continuity with services and cut costs. Recent studies show that ICT and the web may also support people in their working lives and social relationships plus help cope with depression and anxiety. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the specific effectiveness of ICT for helping people with severe mental health problems such as schizophrenia. This review includes six studies with a total of 1063 people. Although education and support using ICT shows great promise, there was no clear benefit of using ICT (when compared with standard or usual care and/or other methods of education and support) for people with severe mental illness. However, the authors of the review suggest that this should not put off or postpone future high quality research on ICT, which is a promising and growing area of much importance.

AB: Abstract - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not reach a satisfactory clinical response with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians face the dilemma of increasing the antipsychotic dose in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. Objectives To examine the efficacy of increasing antipsychotic dose compared to keeping the same dose in the treatment of people with schizophrenia who have not responded (as defined in the individual studies) to an initial antipsychotic drug trial. We also examine the adverse effects associated with such a procedure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting useable data, comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose rather than maintaining the original dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data . We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results Ten relevant RCTs with 675 participants are included in this review. All trials were double blind except one single blind. All studies had a run‐in phase to confirm they did not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. The trials were published between 1980 and 2016. In most studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. In addition sample sizes were often small, limiting the overall quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the number of participants who showed clinically relevant response (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.40, 9 RCTs, N = 533,  low‐quality evidence ), or left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.07,  very low quality evidence ), or due to any reason (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90, 5 RCTs, N = 353,  low‐quality evidence ). Similarly, no clear difference was found in general mental state as measured by PANSS total score change (MD −1.44, 95% CI −6.85 to 3.97, 3 RCTs, N = 258,  very low quality evidence ). At least one adverse effect was equivocal between groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.50, 2 RCTs, N = 191,  very low quality evidence ). Data were not reported for time in hospital or quality‐of‐life outcomes. Finally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not show any effect on the primary outcome but these analyses were clearly underpowered. Authors' conclusions Current data do not show any clear differences between increasing or maintaining the antipsychotic dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Adverse effect reporting was limited and poor. There is an urgent need for further trials in order to determine the optional treatment strategy in such cases. Plain language summary Increasing versus maintaining the dose of antipsychotic medication for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to treatment Review question If a person with schizophrenia does not initially respond to an antipsychotic medication, is increasing the dose of this antipsychotic effective and safe? Background Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia do not respond fully (i.e. symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations still remain) with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians can consider increasing the antipsychotic dose beyond regular thresholds or switching to a different antipsychotic drug in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. The evidence surrounding the optimal treatment strategy is scarce. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia ran an electronic search of their specialised register up to 30 March 2017 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia who were not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment to receive either an increased antipsychotic dose or continue on the same dose. The search returned 1919 records, which were checked for eligibility by the review authors. Evidence found Ten trials met the review requirements and provided usable data. No clear difference between increasing the dose of the antipsychotic drug and continuing antipsychotic treatment at the same dose was shown for any efficacy (clinical response) or safety (incidence of adverse effects) outcomes. The evidence currently available is limited and of low or very low quality. In particular, very few studies reported adverse effects adequately. Conclusions The results of the present review show that there is no good‐quality evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that increasing the antipsychotic dose for patients not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment differs from continuing antipsychotic treatment at the same dose. No clear evidence regarding safety is available. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be made. Larger, well‐designed trials are needed.

AB: Abstract - Background People with schizophrenia and severe mental illness may require considerable support from health care professionals, in most cases over a long period of time. Research on the effects of psychotherapy for schizophrenia has shown mixed results. Although pharmacological interventions remain the treatment of choice, the effects of treatments focusing on psychosocial factors affecting schizophrenia are important. Objectives To review the effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, or both, for people with schizophrenia or severe mental illness. Search methods For the updated review, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2008) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria We sought all randomised trials of individual psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis for people with schizophrenia or severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a fixed‐effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and weighted mean differences (WMD) using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We included four randomised trials (total 528 participants, 5 comparisons). All used a psychodynamic approach and reported limited data. For individual psychodynamic therapy versus medication alone we found significantly more participants in the therapy group were unable to be discharged (n=92, RR 8.35 CI 2.0 to 34.3, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6). We found no significant difference between groups in the number of participants who were re‐hospitalised (n=24, RR 0.63 CI 0.3 to 1.4) during long‐term analyses. At 12 months, fewer participants in the psychotherapy groups needed additional medications compared with those who did receive medication (n=74, RR 0.64 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 3 to 6), and also at three years follow up (n=87, RR 0.85 CI 0.8 to 1.0, NNT 7 CI 5 to 26). For individual psychodynamic therapy plus medication versus medication alone we found no significant difference in suicide (n=92, RR 0.16 CI 0.01 to 2.9) or suitability for discharge (n=92, RR 1.09 CI 0.2 to 7.4). Also, we found re‐hospitalisation rates in long‐term analyses were equivocal (n=24, RR 1.00 CI 0.4 to 2.6). For insight‐orientated psychodynamic psychotherapy versus reality adaptive psychotherapy we found no significant difference in re‐hospitalisation rates (n=164, RR 1.20 CI 0.9 to 1.6), but we found study attrition favoured the insight‐orientated psychodynamic psychotherapy group at 12 months (n=164, RR 0.46 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). For individual psychodynamic psychotherapy versus group psychotherapy we found no significant difference in global state 'not improved' (n=100, RR 1.27 CI 1.0 to 1.7). For individual psychodynamic therapy plus medication versus individual psychodynamic therapy we found rates of re‐hospitalisation during long‐term analyses were equivocal (n=24, RR 1.00 CI 0.4 to 2.6). There is no clear evidence of any positive effect of psychodynamic therapy and the possibility of adverse effects seems never to have been considered. We did not identify any trials using a psychoanalytic approach. Authors' conclusions Current data do not support the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy techniques for hospitalised people with schizophrenia. If psychoanalytic therapy is being used for people with schizophrenia there is an urgent need for trials. Plain language summary Individual psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis for schizophrenia and severe mental illness Psychodynamic treatment is an intervention that can be classed as one of the 'talking' therapies. The relationship between the person seeking therapy and the therapist form the main component of the therapy. Its use for people with schizophrenia as a sole treatment, without medication, has not been evaluated very well, apart from four studies in the early 1970s and 1980s. It is clear from the limited studies available that medication is an important part of any treatment for people with psychotic illnesses and should be used in conjunction with any talking treatments.

AB: Abstract - Background Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non‐randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second‐generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model, but included only one study. Main results We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH‐SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin. Authors' conclusions Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. Plain language summary Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who might be interested in this review? General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. What questions does this review aim to answer? Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. What does evidence from the review reveal? The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples' preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD.

AB: Abstract - Background Transcranial magnetic stimulation can either excite or inhibit cortical areas of the brain, depending on whether the speed of the repetitive stimulation is applied at high or low frequencies. It has been used for physiological studies and it has also been proposed as a treatment for depression. Objectives To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulationfor treating depression. Search methods An electronic search was performed including the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group trials register (last searched June 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1966‐2001), EMBASE (1974‐2001), PsycLIT (1980‐2001), and bibliographies from reviewed articles. Unpublished data and grey literature were searched through personal communications with researchers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression. Data collection and analysis All reviewers independently extracted the information and verified it by cross‐checking. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.   Continuous data: When similar studies were grouped, the overall standardised mean difference was calculated under a fixed effect model weighted by the inverse variance method with 95% confidence intervals. (In the presence of statistical heterogeneity, a random effects model was to be used.) Main results Sixteen trials were included in the review and fourteen contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. Most comparisons did not show differences between rTMS and other interventions. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, except for one time period (after two weeks of treatment) for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency; and also for right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low frequency, both in favour of rTMS and both using the Hamilton scale. Comparison of rTMS (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high frequency) with electroconvulsive therapy showed no difference except for psychotic patients after two weeks treatment, using the Hamilton scale, which indicated that electroconvulsive therapy was more effective than rTMS. Authors' conclusions The information in this review suggests that there is no strong evidence for benefit from using transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat depression, although the small sample sizes do not exclude the possibility of benefit.

AB: Abstract - Background Tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains a troublesome adverse effect of conventional antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication. It has been proposed that TD could have a component of central cholinergic deficiency. Cholinergic drugs have been used to treat TD. Objectives To determine the effects of cholinergic drugs (arecoline, choline, deanol, lecithin, meclofenoxate, physostigmine, RS 86, tacrine, metoxytacrine, galantamine, ipidacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, xanomeline, cevimeline) for treating antipsychotic‐induced TD in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness. Search methods An electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (16 July 2015 and April 2017) was undertaken. This register is assembled by extensive searches for randomised controlled trials in many electronic databases, registers of trials, conference proceedings and dissertations. References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Selection criteria We included reports identified by the search if they were of controlled trials involving people with antipsychotic‐induced TD and chronic mental illness, who had been randomly allocated to either a cholinergic agent or to a placebo or no intervention. Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data and, where possible, estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis, with the assumption that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results We included 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo published between 1976 and 2014. All studies involved small numbers of participants (five to 60 people). Three studies that investigated the new cholinergic Alzheimer drugs for the treatment of TD are new to this update. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, we are unsure if data are incomplete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported. We are uncertain about the effect of new or old cholinergic drugs on no clinically important improvement in TD symptoms when compared with placebo; the quality of evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.23; 27 people, 4 RCTs). Eight trials found that cholinergic drugs may make little or no difference to deterioration of TD symptoms (low‐quality evidence, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.24; 147 people). Again, due to very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects on mental state (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.61; 77 people, 5 RCTs), adverse events (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.14; 106 people, 4 RCTs), and leaving the study early (RR 1.09,95% CI 0.56 to 2.10; 288 people 12 RCTs). No study reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life. Authors' conclusions TD remains a major public health problem. The clinical effects of both older cholinergic drugs and new cholinergic agents, now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, are unclear, as too few, too small studies leave many questions unanswered. Cholinergic drugs should remain of interest to researchers and currently have little place in routine clinical work. However, with the advent of new cholinergic agents now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, scope exists for more informative trials. If these new cholinergic agents are to be investigated for treating people with TD, their effects should be demonstrated in large well‐designed, conducted and reported randomised trials. Plain language summary Cholinergic medication for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question . Are cholinergic drugs useful for treating the unpleasant side‐effect ‐ tardive dyskinesia ‐ in people with schizophrenia or other similar mental health problems who are taking antipsychotics. Background . People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side‐effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high dose of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. It has been proposed that tardive dyskinesia could be due to cholinergic deficiency. Older cholinergic drugs, such as deanol, lecithin and meclofenoxate, have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia. New cholinergic drugs, such as donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and may also be promising in the treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Study characteristics . We searched for trials in July 2015 and April 2017, using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials. The review includes 14 studies investigating the use of cholinergic drugs compared with placebo. All studies randomised small numbers of participants (five to 60 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Key results . We found the effects of both older and newer cholinergic drugs to be unclear as too few and too small studies are available and do not yield great evidence and leave many questions unanswered. Quality of the evidence . The available evidence is weak, limited, and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia based on our findings. To fully investigate whether the use of cholinergic drugs have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be well‐designed, larger, longer‐term studies, particularly on new cholinergic drugs currently being used for treating Alzheimer’s disease.

AB: Abstract - Background Dementia is a widespread condition characterized by acquired global impairment of intellect, memory and personality, but without impairment of consciousness. There is no definitive treatment for vascular dementia. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese method that has been used for the prevention and treatment of diseases over three‐thousand years. Many kinds of acupuncture methods such as body acupuncture, scalp acupuncture and electroacupuncture are in use for the treatment of vascular dementia in hospitals in China. Body acupuncture and electroacupuncture are the most commonly used. Objectives To assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of acupuncture therapy for treating vascular dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 24 January 2011 using the terms and tags created for records of studies in dementia using acupuncture. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database was searched and the web was searched using the search engine Copernic. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing acupuncture therapy in the treatment of vascular dementia were eligible for inclusion, regardless of language and publication type. Studies with inadequate randomisation were excluded. Studies were excluded if participants were receiving any treatment for their vascular dementia other than the acupuncture intervention or control treatment. Data collection and analysis Studies were selected for inclusion and data were extracted by two review authors working independently.   Comparisons were made between patients treated with acupuncture and controls, on an intention‐to‐treat basis where possible. If possible, data from different trials were pooled and overall estimates of the treatment difference were calculated. Weighted or standardised mean differences or odds ratios were used, as appropriate. Main results In the absence of any suitable randomized placebo‐controlled trials in this area, we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions The effectiveness of acupuncture for vascular dementia is uncertain. More evidence is required to show that vascular dementia can be treated effectively by acupuncture. There are no RCTs and high quality trials are few. Randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials are urgently needed. Plain language summary Acupuncture to treat vascular dementia There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether acupuncture provides any effect when treating people with vascular dementia. Acupuncture is used to treat vascular dementia, but because no randomized controlled trials of acupuncture versus placebo were found its efficacy and safety could not be analysed in this review. There is a need for randomized placebo‐controlled trials of acupuncture for people with vascular dementia.

AB: Abstract - Background Fluphenazine is one of the first drugs to be classed as an 'antipsychotic' and has been widely available for five decades. Objectives To compare the effects of oral fluphenazine with placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. To evaluate any available economic studies and value outcome data. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (23 July 2013, 23 December 2014, 9 November 2016 and 28 December 2017 ) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We sought all randomised controlled trials comparing oral fluphenazine with placebo relevant to people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were global state and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis For the effects of interventions, a review team inspected citations and abstracts independently, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed trials. We extracted data independently. Dichotomous data were analysed using fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were excluded if more than 50% of people were lost to follow‐up, but, where possible, mean differences (MD) were calculated. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by an economic review team to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already‐included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary. Main results From over 1200 electronic records of 415 studies identified by our initial search and this updated search, we excluded 48 potentially relevant studies and included seven trials published between 1964 and 1999 that randomised 439 (mostly adult participants). No new included trials were identified for this review update. Compared with placebo, global state outcomes of 'not improved or worsened' were not significantly different in the medium term in one small study (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 1.12 CI 0.79 to 1.58,  very low quality of evidence ). The risk of relapse in the long term was greater in two small studies in people receiving placebo (n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.05 to 3.31,  very low quality of evidence ), however with high degree of heterogeneity in the results. Only one person allocated fluphenazine was reported in the same small study to have died on long‐term follow‐up (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 2.38 CI 0.10 to 55.72,  low quality of evidence ). Short‐term extrapyramidal adverse effects were significantly more frequent with fluphenazine compared to placebo in two other studies for the outcomes of akathisia (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.43 CI 1.23 to 9.56,  moderate quality of evidence ) and rigidity (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.54 CI 1.76 to 7.14,  moderate quality of evidence ). For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes for relapse and presented them in additional tables. Authors' conclusions The findings in this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know, but they provide quantification to support clinical impression. Fluphenazine's global position as an effective treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the outcome of this review. However, fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment and if accessible, other inexpensive drugs less associated with adverse effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Fluphenazine versus Placebo for Schizophrenia Review question:  Is sluphenazine effective for the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo? Background Fluphenazine is one of the first drugs to be classed as an 'antipsychotic' and has been widely available for decades. Searching for evidence We updated the electronic search in December 2017 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive oral fluphenazine or placebo. No new studies were found to be added in this update. Evidence found Seven trials met the review requirements and provided useable data.The evidence currently available is of poor quality and suggests that whilst fluphenazine is a potent and effective antipsychotic, it has considerable side effects. Conclusions Antipsychotic drugs are the first line and mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. They help to effectively treat psychotic symptoms such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations) and having strange beliefs (delusions). Fluphenazine was one of the first antipsychotics and has been available for around 50 years. Fluphenazine is inexpensive and in developing countries, may be one of the only drug treatments available. In most of Europe and North America, despite still being available, the arrival of newer antipsychotic drugs has reduced the use of fluphenazine and its market share. Fluphenazine has debilitating side effects, including: dizziness; movement disorders such as involuntary movements or spasms; shaking and tremors; inner restlessness and the inability to sit still; and problems with blood pressure, fever and muscle stiffness. This review included seven studies and compared the effects of fluphenazine taken by mouth with placebo (‘dummy’ treatment).  In the main, the findings of the review support the widespread view that fluphenazine is a potent and effective antipsychotic but has considerable side effects, other antipsychotic drugs may well be preferable. Fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment with serious side effects, so other inexpensive antipsychotic drugs with fewer side effects may be better for people with schizophrenia. Despite this, fluphenazine has a low cost and is widely available, so is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. However, some of fluphenazine's side effects could be expensive in terms of human suffering and personal cost of treatment. Even though fluphenazine has been used as an antipsychotic drug for decades, there are still a surprisingly small number of well‐conducted studies measuring its effectiveness and potential to cause side effects. Future large‐scale research should report on important outcomes such as improvement in mental health, relapse, hospital discharge and admission, levels of satisfaction with treatment and quality of life. This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray from RETHINK.

AB: Abstract - Background Prompts to encourage attendance at clinics are often used in day‐to‐day practice by diligent carers of people with mental health problems. These may take the form of telephone prompting, financial incentives or issuing a copy of the referral letter to the appointee. Objectives To estimate the effects of simple prompting by professional carers to encourage attendance at clinics for those with suspected serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2009) and reference lists, as well as contacting authors of studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria All relevant randomised (or quasi‐randomised) studies comparing the addition of 'prompts' to standard care for those with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Prompts had the stated purpose of encouraging attendance or contact with mental health teams and could be text‐based, (for example in the form of a letter), electronic, by telephone call, by personal visit, or could employ financial or other rewards. Data collection and analysis Studies and data were independently selected and extracted. For homogeneous dichotomous data the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data the reviewers calculated weighted mean differences. Main results Only four relevant trials were identified (total n=789). It is not clear whether there is any real difference between attendance of those prompted by telephone one or two days before the appointment, and those given the standard appointment management system (2 RCTs, n=457, RR missed appointment 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.1). Text‐based prompts in the form of a letter, a few days before the appointment day, may increase clinic attendance when compared with no prompt (3 RCTs, n=326, RR missed appointment 0.76 CI 0.43 to 1.32). Only one small study (n=61) reported data on the combination of telephone and text‐based prompts versus no prompt, no real difference between groups was apparent (RR missed appointment 0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.2). When telephone prompts were compared with text‐based prompts (1 RCT, n=75), the latter, in the form of an 'orientation statement' (a short paragraph, taking about 30 seconds to read, explaining the programme of care, the fee system, and providing gentle encouragement) may be somewhat more effective than the telephone prompt (RR missed appointment 1.9 CI 0.98 to 3.8). One study (n=120) compared a standard letter prompt with a letter 'orientation statement'. Overall, results tended to favour the orientation statement approach rather than the simple letter prompting attendance but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (RR missed appointment 1.6 CI 0.9 to 2.9). When prompts were considered regardless of their type, the results were of greater significance and suggested an effect to increase the rate of attendance (RR missed appointments 0.80 CI 0.65 to 0.98). The inclusion of five new studies to the awaiting classification section may affect results when assessed. Authors' conclusions There is evidence that a simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment may encourage attendance, and a simple orientation‐type letter may be more effective than a telephone prompt. This simple intervention could be a more cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance, but supplementing these data with the results of large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies would be desirable. Plain language summary Prompts to encourage appointment attendance for people with serious mental illness First appointments at a mental health clinic can be a daunting prospect. Failure to attend is common, wastes time, and can result in important delays in getting proper care. A gentle prompt, near to the time of appointment, would, if effective, seem a cost effective way of encouraging attendance. This review sought evidence for the effects of telephoning or sending a letter, in the days just before the appointment. Relevant studies were found, and although none were conclusive, all suggested that a simple prompt could indeed encourage attendance.

AB: Abstract - Background Most people with schizophrenia have a cyclical pattern of illness characterised by remission and relapses. The illness can reduce the ability of self‐care and functioning and can lead to the illness becoming disabling. Life skills programmes, emphasising the needs associated with independent functioning, are often a part of the rehabilitation process. These programmes have been developed to enhance independent living and quality of life for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of life skills programmes compared with standard care or other comparable therapies for people with chronic mental health problems. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010). We supplemented this process with handsearching and scrutiny of references. We inspected references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials for life skills programmes versus other comparable therapies or standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 483 participants. These evaluated life skills programmes versus standard care, or support group. We found no significant difference in life skills performance between people given life skills training and standard care (1 RCT, n = 32, MD ‐1.10; 95% CI ‐7.82 to 5.62). Life skills training did not improve or worsen study retention (5 RCTs, n = 345, RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.40 to 3.36). We found no significant difference in PANSS positive, negative or total scores between life skills intervention and standard care. We found quality of life scores to be equivocal between participants given life skills training (1 RCT, n = 32, MD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.03) and standard care. Life skills compared with support groups also did not reveal any significant differences in PANSS scores, quality of life, or social performance skills (1 RCT, n = 158, MD ‐0.90; 95% CI ‐3.39 to 1.59). Authors' conclusions Currently there is no good evidence to suggest life skills programmes are effective for people with chronic mental illnesses. More robust data are needed from studies that are adequately powered to determine whether life skills training is beneficial for people with chronic mental health problems. Plain language summary Life skills programmes for chronic mental illnesses Having a mental health problem can cause difficulties and obstacles in all areas of life, even those as simple as washing, shopping, talking openly with other people, brushing teeth, cleaning the house, managing money, making friends, shaving and being independent. Having a mental health problem, combined with the sleep‐like haze of many antipsychotic medications, limits people’s ability to look after themselves, socialise with other people, take part in education or career development and find work.  Life skills programmes attempt to remedy some of these difficulties by encouraging independent living, so enhancing quality of life. Life skills often have several components: communication and talking; financial awareness and money management; domestic tasks (such as cooking, washing‐ up dishes, hoovering, doing the laundry and running a home); and personal self‐care (such as washing, bathing, cleaning teeth, shaving, combing hair and getting dressed). Other life skills include training on coping with stress, shopping for and eating healthy food, knowing the time, taking medication, improving social skills, using transport and forward planning.   Rehabilitation or getting better is slow, complex and difficult. There are many ways of engaging with people during this process, including: creative therapies (art, drama, music, poetry, education, dancing, singing); life skills (as described above); work‐based therapy to enhance employment; and recreational activities (such as group walks, swimming, sport, reading, writing a diary, watching television, going to parties, events and day trips).  This review looks at different types of rehabilitation therapy for people with mental health problems. It compares life skills training with occupational therapy and peer support (where a group of people with mental health problems were encouraged to help each other). Comparison was also made with standard or usual care. Life skills, occupational therapy and peer support all aim to promote health by enabling people to perform meaningful and purposeful activities. In the main, the authors of the review conclude that there is no great difference between those that receive life skills, occupational therapy, peer support and standard care. It is questionable if people should be put under pressure to attend life skills and not known whether life skills are a benefit or perhaps even harmful. Professionals and service users invest much time in life skills and this may cost both time and money. However, the quality of scientific evidence is low and uncertain. The authors note that life skills are still a simple and easy way that has the potential to make great benefits for people who are almost disabled by mental health problems.

AB: Abstract - Background The prevalence of mental health and psychosocial problems in primary care is high. Counselling is a potential treatment for these patients, but there is a lack of consensus over the effectiveness of this treatment in primary care. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of counselling for patients with mental health and psychosocial problems in primary care. Search methods To update the review, the following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis (CCDAN) trials registers (to December 2010), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to May 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of counselling for mental health and psychosocial problems in primary care. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction sheet by two reviewers. Trials were rated for quality by two reviewers using Cochrane risk of bias criteria, to assess the extent to which their design and conduct were likely to have prevented systematic error. Continuous measures of outcome were combined using standardised mean differences. An overall effect size was calculated for each outcome with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data from different measuring instruments were transformed into a standard effect size by dividing mean values by standard deviations. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of the results. Economic analyses were summarised in narrative form. There was no assessment of adverse events. Main results Nine trials were included in the review, involving 1384 randomised participants. Studies varied in risk of bias, although two studies were identified as being at high risk of selection bias because of problems with concealment of allocation. All studies were from primary care in the United Kingdom and thus comparability was high. The analysis found significantly greater clinical effectiveness in the counselling group compared with usual care in terms of mental health outcomes in the short‐term (standardised mean difference ‐0.28, 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.13, n = 772, 6 trials) but not in the long‐term (standardised mean difference ‐0.09, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.10, n = 475, 4 trials), nor on measures of social function (standardised mean difference ‐0.09, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.11, n = 386, 3 trials). Levels of satisfaction with counselling were high. There was some evidence that the overall costs of counselling and usual care were similar. There were limited comparisons between counselling and other psychological therapies, medication, or other psychosocial interventions. Authors' conclusions Counselling is associated with significantly greater clinical effectiveness in short‐term mental health outcomes compared to usual care, but provides no additional advantages in the long‐term. Participants were satisfied with counselling. Although some types of health care utilisation may be reduced, counselling does not seem to reduce overall healthcare costs. The generalisability of these findings to settings outside the United Kingdom is unclear. Plain language summary Counselling for mental health and psychosocial problems in primary care Many patients in primary care suffer from mental health and psychosocial problems. These problems often involve feelings of sadness, nerves or stress. Many of these problems may be due to personal and social problems or reactions to life events such as physical illness or unemployment. ‘Counselling’ is a recognised psychological therapy that is often provided to such patients. In the United Kingdom, counsellors have often been employed to deliver psychological therapy to patients in primary care settings. Providing counselling alongside other treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy means that patients have greater choice, and that alternatives can be found for patients who either do not benefit from standard treatments or who do not find them acceptable. However, recent clinical guidelines in the United Kingdom have highlighted the lack of evidence for counselling compared to other treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy, and have not been able to clearly recommend the use of counselling in primary care. In this review we found nine studies involving counselling in primary care for 1384 participants. There were some problems with the methods in some studies. The evidence suggested that counselling is better than usual general practitioner care in improving mental health outcomes in the short term, although the advantages are modest. People who receive counselling in primary care from a trained counsellor are more likely to feel better immediately after treatment and be more satisfied than those who receive care from their general practitioner. However, in the long term, counselling does not seem to be any better than GP care. Although some types of healthcare utilisation may be reduced, counselling does not seem to reduce overall healthcare costs. There is very limited evidence comparing counselling with other psychological therapies (2 studies with 272 participants) or with antidepressant medication (1 study with 83 participants).

AB: Abstract - Background Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first‐line treatment in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer antidepressive agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug‐approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand‐searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active antidepressive agents (including non‐conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials. Main results A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in the meta‐analysis.Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95% confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs. Authors' conclusions Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost‐effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression. Plain language summary Milnacipran versus other antidepressive agents for depression Major depression, also known as major depressive disorder or unipolar depression, is a common mental disorder characterised by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy pleasurable activities. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life. Antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first‐line treatment for major depression in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care in some countries. This systematic review investigated the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran compared to that of other antidepressive agents in the acute phase treatment of major depression. A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (2277 participants) were included in this review. When we brought together the results of approximately 2000 patients, we were unable to say whether milnacipran is better, worse or the same when compared to other antidepressive agents used in practice in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. However, there is some evidence that fewer people taking milnacipran stop taking the drug ('drop out') due to side effects and fewer people taking milnacipran experience side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth or constipation than do people who take tricyclic antidepressants.

AB: Abstract - Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that is characterised by positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions; negative symptoms, such as flattened affect, thought disorder (disrupted speech), and lack of motivation; and cognitive symptoms, such as problems with memory and attention. Schizophrenia can occur as an isolated episode, or as a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, and is associated with impairment in psychosocial and occupational functioning. Although antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for people with schizophrenia, in most countries mental health services usually provide a range of add‐on interventions, including occupational therapy. This is a complex intervention designed to support and enable continued participation in daily life through engagement in activities and occupations meaningful to the individual. Occupational therapists are professionals trained to deliver therapy where the emphasis is on improving occupational function and participation rather than treating symptoms, and uses a wide range of methods based on the needs of individuals. However, similar interventions may also be delivered by staff not trained as occupational therapists. Objectives To examine the effects of occupational therapy delivered by occupational therapists compared to occupational therapy delivered by any other person for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers) on 4 November 2016 and 26 July 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials evaluating the functional or clinical outcomes of occupational therapy, or both, for people with schizophrenia delivered by occupational therapists compared with occupational therapy for people with schizophrenia delivered by anyone other than occupational therapists. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. Main results The search yielded 1633 records. Of these, we retrieved 17 full‐text reports (14 studies) for further scrutiny, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Currently there are no randomised controlled trials comparing delivery of occupational therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia by occupational therapists with delivery of similar interventions by anyone other than occupational therapists. Research studies employing methodologically robust trial designs are needed to establish whether or not there are better outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with occupational therapy that is delivered by trained occupational therapists. Plain language summary Occupational therapy for schizophrenia provided by occupational therapists compared to others Review question Is there good‐quality evidence that occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists rather than anyone else? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition with a range of symptoms including hearing voices, unusual beliefs, paranoia, disorganised thinking or speech, and loss of motivation. In addition to people diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving medical treatments, services that support such individuals often provide further therapies such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help improve the functioning and ability to take part in meaningful activities of people with schizophrenia, rather than focusing on reducing symptoms. Occupational therapy may be provided by specialist professionals trained as occupational therapists. However, similar therapy may be provided by other people who are not trained occupational therapists (e.g. doctors, nurses, other allied health professionals, or support staff). We wanted to find out whether there were any differences between the effectiveness of occupational therapy provided by occupational therapists and similar therapy provided by people not trained as occupational therapists. Searching for evidence On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. Evidence found We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full‐text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies. Conclusions At present there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to permit a judgement as to whether occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists compared to anyone else. Research is needed to answer this question and to help service providers plan future services that include occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

AB: Abstract - Background Panic disorder is characterised by the presence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks, discrete periods of fear or anxiety that have a rapid onset and include symptoms such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating and shaking. Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. A previous Cochrane meta‐analysis suggested that psychological therapy (either alone or combined with pharmacotherapy) can be chosen as a first‐line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However, it is not yet clear whether certain psychological therapies can be considered superior to others. In order to answer this question, in this review we performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA), in which we compared eight different forms of psychological therapy and three forms of a control condition. Objectives To assess the comparative efficacy and acceptability of different psychological therapies and different control conditions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. Search methods We conducted the main searches in the CCDANCTR electronic databases (studies and references registers), all years to 16 March 2015. We conducted complementary searches in PubMed and trials registries. Supplementary searches included reference lists of included studies, citation indexes, personal communication to the authors of all included studies and grey literature searches in OpenSIGLE. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on adults with a formal diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We considered the following psychological therapies: psychoeducation (PE), supportive psychotherapy (SP), physiological therapies (PT), behaviour therapy (BT), cognitive therapy (CT), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT (3W) and psychodynamic therapies (PD). We included both individual and group formats. Therapies had to be administered face‐to‐face. The comparator interventions considered for this review were: no treatment (NT), wait list (WL) and attention/psychological placebo (APP). For this review we considered four short‐term (ST) outcomes (ST‐remission, ST‐response, ST‐dropouts, ST‐improvement on a continuous scale) and one long‐term (LT) outcome (LT‐remission/response). Data collection and analysis As a first step, we conducted a systematic search of all relevant papers according to the inclusion criteria. For each outcome, we then constructed a treatment network in order to clarify the extent to which each type of therapy and each comparison had been investigated in the available literature. Then, for each available comparison, we conducted a random‐effects meta‐analysis. Subsequently, we performed a network meta‐analysis in order to synthesise the available direct evidence with indirect evidence, and to obtain an overall effect size estimate for each possible pair of therapies in the network. Finally, we calculated a probabilistic ranking of the different psychological therapies and control conditions for each outcome. Main results We identified 1432 references; after screening, we included 60 studies in the final qualitative analyses. Among these, 54 (including 3021 patients) were also included in the quantitative analyses. With respect to the analyses for the first of our primary outcomes, (short‐term remission), the most studied of the included psychological therapies was CBT (32 studies), followed by BT (12 studies), PT (10 studies), CT (three studies), SP (three studies) and PD (two studies). The quality of the evidence for the entire network was found to be low for all outcomes. The quality of the evidence for CBT vs NT, CBT vs SP and CBT vs PD was low to very low, depending on the outcome. The majority of the included studies were at unclear risk of bias with regard to the randomisation process. We found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and detection bias. We also found selective outcome reporting bias to be present and we strongly suspected publication bias. Finally, we found almost half of the included studies to be at high risk of researcher allegiance bias. Overall the networks appeared to be well connected, but were generally underpowered to detect any important disagreement between direct and indirect evidence. The results showed the superiority of psychological therapies over the WL condition, although this finding was amplified by evident small study effects (SSE). The NMAs for ST‐remission, ST‐response and ST‐improvement on a continuous scale showed well‐replicated evidence in favour of CBT, as well as some sparse but relevant evidence in favour of PD and SP, over other therapies. In terms of ST‐dropouts, PD and 3W showed better tolerability over other psychological therapies in the short term. In the long term, CBT and PD showed the highest level of remission/response, suggesting that the effects of these two treatments may be more stable with respect to other psychological therapies. However, all the mentioned differences among active treatments must be interpreted while taking into account that in most cases the effect sizes were small and/or results were imprecise. Authors' conclusions There is no high‐quality, unequivocal evidence to support one psychological therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, the results show that CBT ‐ the most extensively studied among the included psychological therapies ‐ was often superior to other therapies, although the effect size was small and the level of precision was often insufficient or clinically irrelevant. In the only two studies available that explored PD, this treatment showed promising results, although further research is needed in order to better explore the relative efficacy of PD with respect to CBT. Furthermore, PD appeared to be the best tolerated (in terms of ST‐dropouts) among psychological treatments. Unexpectedly, we found some evidence in support of the possible viability of non‐specific supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder; however, the results concerning SP should be interpreted cautiously because of the sparsity of evidence regarding this treatment and, as in the case of PD, further research is needed to explore this issue. Behaviour therapy did not appear to be a valid alternative to CBT as a first‐line treatment for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia Why is this review important? Many people suffer from panic disorder. Panic disorder can occur on its own or with agoraphobia. People with panic disorder experience recurring panic attacks. During a panic attack people feel the sudden onset of intense fear alongside a series of bodily symptoms such as a racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. People with agoraphobia feel an intense fear of developing a panic attack in situations where escape might be difficult or embarrassing. This fear often leads to the avoidance of such situations. There are many different types of talking therapies that are used to treat panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However it is not clear whether certain talking therapies are more effective than others at treating panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In this review we compared the effectiveness of different types of talking therapy. Who will be interested in this review? People with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Friends and family of people with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. General practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists. Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? Are any of the included psychological therapies more effective and better tolerated than others in the rapid reduction of panic/agoraphobia symptoms? Can any of the included psychological therapies guarantee better results one year after termination? Which studies were included in the review? We searched medical databases up to 16 March 2015 to find all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) of talking therapies in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. To be included in the review studies had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. We included 60 studies in the review. Fifty‐four of the included studies (involving 3021 participants) were used in numerical analyses. The review authors rated the overall quality of the studies as low to very low. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The results of the review show that in general talking therapies are more effective than no treatment. There was no strong evidence to support one talking therapy over the others for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. However, there was some low‐quality evidence in favour of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy over other talking therapies for short‐term remission and short‐term reduction in symptoms. The results concerning supportive psychotherapy should, however, be treated with caution because of the small amount of evidence available about this treatment. On the other hand, beyond the evidence regarding its efficacy, psychodynamic therapy also showed promising results in terms of tolerability: as a way of assessing how well people tolerated the talking therapies, we assessed short‐term dropout rates. We found that there were fewer dropouts in psychodynamic therapy and third‐wave CBT, suggesting that people tolerate these therapies better than other therapies. What should happen next? More high‐quality research is needed to be able to fully compare the effectiveness of different talking therapies. In particular, more new studies are needed that compare the specific talking therapies CBT, psychodynamic therapy and supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

AB: Abstract - Background Anxiety frequently coexists with depression and adding benzodiazepines to antidepressant treatment is common practice to treat people with major depression. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether this combined treatment is more effective and not any more harmful than antidepressants alone. It has been suggested that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long‐term administration and their chronic use carries risks of dependence. This is the 2019 updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2005. This update follows a new protocol to conform with the most recent Cochrane methodology guidelines, with the inclusion of 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE evaluations for quality of evidence. Objectives To assess the effects of combining antidepressants with benzodiazepines compared with antidepressants alone for major depression in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to May 2019. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressants alone for adults with major depression. We excluded studies administering psychosocial therapies targeted at depression and anxiety disorders concurrently. Antidepressants had to be prescribed, on average, at or above the minimum effective dose as presented by  Hansen 2009  or according to the North American or European regulations. The combination therapy had to last at least four weeks. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We entered data into Review Manager 5. We used intention‐to‐treat data. We combined continuous outcome variables of depressive and anxiety severity using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Regarding the primary outcome of acceptability, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies. Main results We identified 10 studies published between 1978 to 2002 involving 731 participants. Six studies used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), two studies used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one study used another heterocyclic antidepressant and one study used TCA or heterocyclic antidepressant. Combined therapy of benzodiazepines plus antidepressants was more effective than antidepressants alone for depressive severity in the early phase (four weeks) (SMD –0.25, 95% CI –0.46 to –0.03; 10 studies, 598 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), but there was no difference between treatments in the acute phase (five to 12 weeks) (SMD –0.18, 95% CI –0.40 to 0.03; 7 studies, 347 participants; low‐quality evidence) or in the continuous phase (more than 12 weeks) (SMD –0.21, 95% CI –0.76 to 0.35; 1 study, 50 participants; low‐quality evidence). For acceptability of treatment, there was no difference in the dropouts due to any reason between combined therapy and antidepressants alone (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). For response in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.35; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 1 study, 52 participants). For remission in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90, 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.16; 1 study, 52 participants). There was no evidence of a difference between combined therapy and antidepressants alone for anxiety severity in the early phase (SMD –0.76, 95% CI –1.67 to 0.14; 3 studies, 129 participants) or in the acute phase (SMD –0.48, 95% CI –1.06 to 0.10; 3 studies, 129 participants). No studies measured severity of insomnia. In terms of adverse effects, the dropout rates due to adverse events were lower for combined therapy than for antidepressants alone (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). However, participants in the combined therapy group reported at least one adverse effect more often than participants who received antidepressants alone (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23; 7 studies, 510 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Most domains of risk of bias in the majority of the included studies were unclear. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting were problematic due to insufficient details reported in most of the included studies and lack of availability of the study protocols. The greatest limitation in the quality of evidence was issues with attrition. Authors' conclusions Combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in improving depression severity, response in depression and remission in depression in the early phase. However, these effects were not maintained in the acute or the continuous phase. Combined therapy resulted in fewer dropouts due to adverse events than antidepressants alone, but combined therapy was associated with a greater proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. The moderate quality evidence of benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in the early phase must be balanced judiciously against possible harms and consideration given to other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant monotherapy may be considered inadequate. We need long‐term, pragmatic randomised controlled trials to compare combination therapy against the monotherapy of antidepressant in major depression. Plain language summary Antidepressants plus benzodiazepines for major depression Why is this review important? Major depression is characterised by depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, diminished energy, fatigue, difficulties with concentration, changes in appetite, sleep disturbances and morbid thoughts of death. Depression often presents with anxiety. Depression and anxiety have negative impacts on the person and on society, often over the long term. Who will be interested in this review? Health professionals, including general practitioners and psychiatrists; people with major depression and the people around them. What question does this review aim to answer? Major depression is often treated by combining antidepressant drugs with benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a family of anxiety‐reducing and hypnotic drugs. This review asked if combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine treatment, compared with antidepressants treatment alone, had an effect on depressive symptoms, rates of recovery and the acceptability of these treatments based on the number of people who left the study early (called the dropout rate), in adults with major depression. Which studies were included in the review? We searched electronic databases to find all relevant studies in adults with major depression. To be included, the studies had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which means adults were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive either antidepressants plus benzodiazepines or antidepressants alone (last search date 23 May 2019). We found 10 relevant studies involving 731 people comparing combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine therapy with treatment with antidepressants alone. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Combining antidepressants and benzodiazepines was more effective than antidepressants alone in improving depression and reducing symptoms in the early phase of treatment (one to four weeks), but there was no evidence of a difference at later time points. There was no evidence of a difference in acceptability (based on dropouts) between the combination treatment compared with antidepressants alone. Dropout rates due to unintended and untoward effects (side effects) were lower for antidepressants plus benzodiazepines compared with antidepressants alone, although at least one side effect was reported more frequently by those treated with a combination of antidepressants plus benzodiazepines. What should happen next? Due to the potential for people to become dependent on benzodiazepines, new longer‐term studies need to compare what happens when the combined treatment involves withdrawing the benzodiazepine after a short period (for example, one month).

AB: Abstract - Background Catatonia is a debilitating disorder of movement and volition associated with schizophrenia and some other mental illnesses. People with catatonia are more likely to require hospitalisation and highly supervised care than those without the disorder. They also have an increased risk of secondary complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration. The mainstay of treatment has been drug therapies and electroconvulsive therapy. Objectives To compare the effects of benzodiazepines with other drugs, placebo or electroconvulsive therapy for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses (SMIs). Search methods We updated our previous search (28 February 2007) by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (9 November 2016; 6 February 2019). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. We also manually searched reference lists from studies selected by the search. Selection criteria All controlled clinical trials that randomised people who have schizophrenia or other similar SMI and experiencing catatonia to receive benzodiazepines or another relevant treatment. We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported usable data. We excluded those not meeting our inclusion criteria or those not reporting usable data. We contacted authors when we required further information; and if we received no response, we put those studies aside as 'awaiting assessment'. Data collection and analysis Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a fixed‐effect model. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included study and generated a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results The searches found 130 citations, from which we could identify 22 possibly relevant studies. From these, we could only include one study. This study had a relatively small sample size of 17 participants who received lorazepam or oxazepam and were drug free for one week before the trial started. The only usable data reported by this study were clinically important change in symptoms of catatonia measured as 50% improvement on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). There was no difference in the numbers of participants showing a clinically important change in their catatonic symptoms (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.16; participants = 17; studies = 1; very low quality evidence). No data were reported for other important outcomes of hospital stay, clinically important change in satisfaction with care, global state, adverse effects or general functioning We did find a few studies meeting our inclusion criteria but they reported no usable data. We had to exclude these. Although poorly reported, these studies do illustrate that relevant studies have been undertaken — they are not impossible to design and conduct. Authors' conclusions Analysis of the results from this review, which was a head‐to‐head comparison of two benzodiazepine monotherapies, does not show a clear difference in effect. No data were available for benzodiazepines compared to placebo or standard care. The lack of usable data and very low quality of data available makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions and further studies with a high‐quality methodology and reporting are required in order to determine more definitively the outcomes associated with benzodiazepine use in the clinical management of catatonia in persons with schizophrenia and other SMI. Plain language summary Benzodiazepines for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or similar serious mental illness Review question   Are the group of drugs called benzodiazepines an effective and tolerable treatment for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses? Background   Catatonia is a debilitating condition that is characterised by diminished, excessive or peculiar movement and activity as well as diminished engagement with the social and physical environment. It can occur when a person has a number of different psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (an enduring mental illness whose hallmark is an altered perception of reality); and less frequently with medical conditions. Some of the other serious mental disorders that are associated with catatonia include bipolar disorder (an illness in which there are extremes of disturbed mood) and depression (another mood disorder characterized by low mood). Benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of catatonia, but there is no good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning their effectiveness. Searching for evidence   The Information Specialist from Cochrane Schizophrenia ran electronic searches of the group's specialised register (the most recent in February 2019) for trials that randomised people with catatonia occurring in conjunction with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses to receive either benzodiazepines or any of the following: other drugs, placebo, or electroconvulsive therapy. One hundred and thirty records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found   One trial was found in the search which met the review requirements and provided limited, very low quality usable data for one outcome only. This trial compared two benzodiazepines (lorazepam vs oxazepam) and found no clear difference between these two treatments for improvement in the symptoms of catatonia for people who have catatonia and schizophrenia or similar serious mental illness. Conclusions   There is insufficient high quality evidence available to answer the review question. More high quality research is needed.

AB: Abstract - Background Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder affecting a person's mind, behaviour and body. It is expressed as a variety of symptoms and is associated with substantial impairment. Despite a range of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment options, there is still room for improvement of the pharmacological treatment of depression in terms of efficacy and tolerability. The latest available antidepressant is vortioxetine. It is assumed that vortioxetine's antidepressant action is related to a direct modulation of serotonergic receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin transporter. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is claimed to be novel. Vortioxetine was placed in the category of "Other" antidepressants and may therefore provide an alternative to existing antidepressant drugs. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of vortioxetine compared with placebo and other antidepressant drugs in the treatment of acute depression in adults. Search methods We searched Cochrane's Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register to May 2016 without applying any restrictions to date, language or publication status. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, regulatory agency reports and trial databases. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy, tolerability, or both of vortioxetine versus placebo or any other antidepressant agent in the treatment of acute depression in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected the studies and extracted data. We extracted data on study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. We analysed intention‐to‐treat (ITT) data only and used risk ratios (RR) as effect sizes for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta‐analyses used random‐effects models. Main results We included 15 studies (7746 participants) in this review. Seven studies were placebo controlled; eight studies compared vortioxetine to serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We were unable to identify any study that compared vortioxetine to antidepressant drugs from other classes, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Vortioxetine may be more effective than placebo across the three efficacy outcomes: response (Mantel‐Haenszel RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49; 14 studies, 6220 participants), remission (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.53; 14 studies, 6220 participants) and depressive symptoms measured using the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Scale (MADRS) (score range: 0 to 34; higher score means worse outcome: MD ‐2.94, 95% CI ‐4.07 to ‐1.80; 14 studies, 5566 participants). The quality of the evidence was low for response and remission and very low for depressive symptoms. We found no evidence of a difference in total dropout rates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19; 14 studies, 6220 participants). More participants discontinued vortioxetine than placebo because of adverse effects (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81; 14 studies, 6220 participants) but fewer discontinued due to inefficacy (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.90, P = 0.02; 14 studies, 6220 participants). The quality of the evidence for dropouts was moderate.The subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not reveal factors that significantly influenced the results. In comparison with other antidepressants, very low‐quality evidence from eight studies showed no clinically significant difference between vortioxetine and SNRIs as a class for response (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00; 3159 participants) or remission (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03; 3155 participants). There was a small difference favouring SNRIs for depressive symptom scores on the MADRS (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.53; 8 studies, 2807 participants). Very low quality evidence from eight studies (3159 participants) showed no significant differences between vortioxetine and the SNRIs as a class for total dropout rates (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.08), dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) and dropouts due to inefficacy (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.30). Against individual antidepressants, analyses suggested that vortioxetine may be less effective than duloxetine in terms of response rates (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94; 6 studies, 2392 participants) and depressive symptoms scores on the MADRS scale (MD 1.99, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.83; 6 studies; 2106 participants). Against venlafaxine, meta‐analysis of two studies found no statistically significant differences (response: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 767 participants; depressive symptom scores: MD 0.02, 95% CI ‐2.49 to 2.54; 701 participants). In terms of number of participants reporting at least one adverse effect (tolerability), vortioxetine was better than the SNRIs as a class (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.94; 8 studies, 3134 participants) and duloxetine (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.95; 6 studies; 2376 participants). However, the sensitivity analysis casts some doubts on this result, as only two studies used comparable dosing. We judged none of the studies to have a high risk of bias for any domain, but we rated all studies to have an unclear risk of bias of selective reporting and other biases. Authors' conclusions The place of vortioxetine in the treatment of acute depression is unclear. Our analyses showed vortioxetine may be more effective than placebo in terms of response, remission and depressive symptoms, but the clinical relevance of these effects is uncertain. Furthermore, the quality of evidence to support these findings was generally low. In comparison to SNRIs, we found no advantage for vortioxetine. Vortioxetine was less effective than duloxetine, but fewer people reported adverse effects when treated with vortioxetine compared to duloxetine. However, these findings are uncertain and not well supported by evidence. A major limitation of the current evidence is the lack of comparisons with the SSRIs, which are usually recommended as first‐line treatments for acute depression. Studies with direct comparisons to SSRIs are needed to address this gap and may be supplemented by network meta‐analyses to define the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of depression. Plain language summary Vortioxetine for the treatment of depression in adults Why is this review important? Many people suffer from major depression. Major depression is a serious illness that can cause significant distress both to patients and their families. Major depression affects people's work and relationships, but can also affect people physically, for example by changing concentration or appetite. Available antidepressant medicines are not always effective in treating major depression and may also have unpleasant side effects. This review compares a new antidepressant, vortioxetine, to placebo (a pretend treatment, e.g. sugar tablet) and other antidepressants. It is assumed that vortioxetine works differently from other available antidepressants and it is important to know if it is an effective treatment and a possible alternative for already available treatments. Who will be interested in this review? People affected by major depression and their families, general practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists, and pharmacists and other professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? Is vortioxetine more effective than placebo in treating individual with an episode of major depression?  Is vortioxetine more or less effective than other available antidepressant treatments?  Do more or fewer people stay in treatment when treated with vortioxetine compared to placebo or other antidepressants?  Do more or fewer people have side effects when treated with vortioxetine compared to other antidepressants? Which studies were included in the review? In May 2016, we searched electronic medical databases to find trials that compared vortioxetine to placebo or other antidepressants. We included only studies that used a randomised controlled design (where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and had adults (aged over 18 years) with a diagnosis of major depression. We included 15 trials, involving 7746 participants in the review. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, depending on the outcome (what symptom or effect was measured) and the comparison. Vortioxetine was more effective than placebo, but it was not more effective than other commonly used antidepressants. The studies found no difference in people stopping their treatment compared to placebo or other antidepressants. Vortioxetine was only compared to one type of medicine (called SNRIs) and not compared to the most frequently prescribed antidepressants. The outcomes varied markedly across studies. What should happen next? No firm conclusion on vortioxetine can be made. Vortioxetine was effective in treating acute major depression, but did not show a clear advantage in comparison with some treatments which are already available. Conclusions are also made difficult because comparisons to the most frequently prescribed antidepressants (called SSRIs) are lacking. Furthermore, it is unclear if vortioxetine has an advantage in specific side effects associated with commonly prescribed antidepressants, for example sexual problems. These questions should be addressed in future studies.

AB: Abstract - Background Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non‐affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re‐inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed‐effect model. Main results We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow‐up (n=512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n=1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early ( n=1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n=1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n=942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n=1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n=1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n=165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43). Authors' conclusions The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well‐established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence‐based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia For previous plain language summary please see  Appendix 3 . People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, being an older drug (‘typical’ or first generation) it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in treating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (‘dummy’ treatment or placebo). Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality. There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people’s mental health, symptoms and functioning. However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating. Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation. It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness. Chlorpromazine is low‐cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods. Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents.

AB: Abstract - Background Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of communicating hydrocephalus also known as non‐obstructive hydrocephalus. This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim‐Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts. To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting. Search methods We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim‐Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data. Main results Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non‐programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results. Authors' conclusions The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non‐programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence. There is a need for more robust research on this topic to be able to determine the effectiveness of ETV in patients with iNPH. Plain language summary Endoscopic third ventriculostomy for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus Background Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid which circulates around the brain and spinal cord and through spaces called ventricles within the brain. It protects the brain, supplies nutrients and removes waste products. Normally, its production and reabsorption are tightly controlled. In idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), there is an increase in the volume of CSF for unknown reasons. This causes the ventricles to enlarge and eventually leads to damage to surrounding brain tissue. It usually occurs in older people. Its characteristic symptoms are deterioration in balance and gait, urinary incontinence and cognitive decline. It is one of the less common causes of dementia. It is thought that the symptoms of some patients with iNPH can be improved by an operation to drain away the excess CSF. This has usually been done by inserting a tube (a shunt) to drain fluid into the chest or abdomen (ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunts). However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of this approach and a significant number of patients develop complications or need further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a newer and less invasive surgical approach which involves making a small hole in the floor of one of the ventricles. Review question We undertook this review to try to determine how safe and effective ETV is for treating iNPH. We did this by looking for any randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) which compared ETV to no surgery or to insertion of a shunt. Results We searched for trials which had been reported by August 2014. We were able to include only one RCT with 42 participants in the review. It compared ETV to insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, but unfortunately a type of shunt which is not often used in standard practice. We compared the numbers of patients whose symptoms improved with each treatment, but the result was too imprecise to allow us to draw a conclusion. In the shunting group, 19% of the patients had a surgical complication, while there were no complications in the ETV group. Due to the small number of participants, we could not be sure whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of the evidence to be very low because there was a high risk of bias in the trial results, because the results were so imprecise, and because several outcomes measured in the trial were not fully reported. Conclusions Doctors and patients should be aware of the limitations of the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of this operation for iNPH. There should be more and larger trials to compare the different treatment options.

AB: Abstract - Background Hip fracture is a major injury that causes significant problems for affected individuals and their family and carers. Over 40% of people with hip fracture have dementia or cognitive impairment. The outcomes of these individuals after surgery are poorer than for those without dementia. It is unclear which care and rehabilitation interventions achieve the best outcomes for these people. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013. Objectives (a) To assess the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies designed specifically for people with dementia following hip fracture surgery compared to usual care. (b) To assess for people with dementia the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies that are designed for all older people, regardless of cognitive status, following hip fracture surgery, compared to usual care. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 16 October 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of any model of enhanced care and rehabilitation for people with dementia after hip fracture surgery compared to usual care. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We synthesised data only if we considered the trials to be sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, and outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included seven trials with a total of 555 participants. Three trials compared models of enhanced care in the inpatient setting with conventional care. Two trials compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with conventional care. Two trials compared geriatrician‐led care in‐hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia, therefore the data included in the review were from subgroups of people with dementia or cognitive impairment participating in randomised controlled trials investigating models of care for all older people following hip fracture. The end of follow‐up in the trials ranged from the point of acute hospital discharge to 24 months after discharge. We considered all trials to be at high risk of bias in more than one domain. As subgroups of larger trials, the analyses lacked power to detect differences between the intervention groups. Furthermore, there were some important differences in baseline characteristics of participants between the experimental and control groups. Using the GRADE approach, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to low or very low. The effect estimates for almost all comparisons were very imprecise, and the overall certainty for most results was very low. There were no data from any study for our primary outcome of health‐related quality of life. There was only very low certainty for our other primary outcome, activities of daily living and functional performance, therefore we were unable to draw any conclusions with confidence. There was low‐certainty that enhanced care and rehabilitation in‐hospital may reduce rates of postoperative delirium (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.22, 2 trials, n = 141) and very low‐certainty associating it with lower rates of some other complications. There was also low‐certainty that, compared to orthopaedic‐led management, geriatrician‐led management may lead to shorter hospital stays (mean difference 4.00 days, 95% CI 3.61 to 4.39, 1 trial, n = 162). Authors' conclusions We found limited evidence that some of the models of enhanced rehabilitation and care used in the included trials may show benefits over usual care for preventing delirium and reducing length of stay for people with dementia who have been treated for hip fracture. However, the certainty of these results is low. Data were available from only a small number of trials, and the certainty for all other results is very low. Determining the optimal strategies to improve outcomes for this growing population of patients should be a research priority. Plain language summary Rehabilitation for people with dementia following a hip fracture operation Background Hip fracture is an injury primarily of elderly people, which is usually caused by a fall. It can affect a person's ability to walk, perform activities of daily living, and remain independent. Hip fracture is more common in people with dementia, and these individuals can find it more difficult to recover because they are at greater risk of becoming more confused and developing additional complications such as pressure sores and chest infections after surgery. They may also find it more difficult to express pain and discomfort. Review question We wanted to learn whether different ways of treating people with dementia following hip fracture might affect how well they recover and what the associated costs of their recovery might be. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review. Study characteristics We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that compared any model of enhanced care and rehabilitation for people with dementia after hip fracture versus the usual care provided in the trial setting. The latest search was performed on 16 October 2019. We identified seven trials that studied a total of 555 people with dementia following hip fracture. Five trials compared an enhanced interdisciplinary rehabilitation and care programme where the various healthcare professionals worked collaboratively across hospital and community settings or just in hospital, to usual hospital care. Two trials compared care in‐hospital led by a geriatrician versus care led by an orthopaedic surgeon. Key findings People with dementia who receive enhanced care and rehabilitation in hospital after a hip fracture may be less likely to develop delirium. When care is led by a geriatrician, they may have stays in hospital that are three to four days shorter than if care is led by an orthopaedic surgeon. There was no information on the effect of any of the care models on quality of life, and we could not be certain about their effects on other important outcomes such as an individual's ability to manage their daily activities, regaining mobility, cognitive function, pain, death rates, or the likelihood of the person returning to the same place they had been living before the fracture. Quality of the evidence The main issues with the evidence were that most of the studies were small and their results may have been subject to bias. Most of the results of the review are very uncertain. None of the care models had been designed specifically for people with dementia. All of the data included in the review came from people with dementia who had been included in larger trials for all older people with hip fractures, although people with dementia may have particular needs. Conclusions There may be some benefits from the care models studied, but the currently available research is insufficient to determine the best ways to care for people with dementia after a hip fracture operation.

AB: Abstract - Background Bipolar disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder and is amongst the top thirty causes of worldwide disability. Mood stabilisers are the primary pharmacological intervention, both in the treatment of acute episodes and in prophylaxis. There is, however, mounting evidence that dietary supplementation with omega‐3 fatty acids may be beneficial in psychiatric conditions, particularly those involving disturbances of mood. Objectives To review the efficacy of omega‐3 fatty acids as either a monotherapy or an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. Search methods Electronic searches of the following databases were performed: CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 12/2/2008, Supplementary searches were carried out on Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, CCDAN Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. The search strategy also included cited reference searching, personal contact with all authors of studies initially included and contact with the omega‐3 producing pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Studies involving males and females of all ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder qualified for inclusion. Studies using any type or dose of omega‐3 fatty acid treatment as monotherapy or in addition to standard pharmacotherapy were eligible. The primary outcome was symptom severity; and secondary outcomes were adverse effects, dropout and satisfaction with treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. All relevant data were extracted. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcome data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Five studies met inclusion criteria for the review, however, methodological quality was highly variable. Only one study, involving 75 participants, provided data for analysis, and showed a benefit of active treatment over control for depression symptom levels (WMD ‐3.93, 95% CI ‐7.00 to ‐0.86)and Clinical Global Impression scores (WMD ‐0.75, 95% CI ‐1.33 to ‐0.17) but not for mania (WMD ‐2.81, 95% CI ‐7.68 to 1.90). No serious adverse effects were reported in the five studies. The pattern of dropout was highly variable between studies. Authors' conclusions Results from one study showed positive effects of omega‐3 as an adjunctive treatment for depressive but not manic symptoms in bipolar disorder. These findings must be regarded with caution owing to the limited data available. There is an acute need for well‐designed and executed randomised controlled trials in this field. Plain language summary Omega‐3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder This systematic review investigated the efficacy of omega‐3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder. Five randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the review. Only one trial provided data that could be analysed, investigating ethyl‐EPA as an adjunctive treatment in a mixed outpatient population. Some positive benefits were found for depressive symptoms but not for mania, and no adverse events were reported. There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base any clear recommendations concerning omega‐3 fatty acids for bipolar disorder. However, given the general health benefits and safety of omega‐3, the preliminary evidence from this review provides a strong case for well‐powered, high‐quality trials in specific index populations.

AB: Abstract - Background Depressive symptoms, often of substantial severity, are found in 50% of newly diagnosed suffers of schizophrenia and 33% of people with chronic schizophrenia who have relapsed. Depression is associated with dysphoria, disability, reduction of motivation to accomplish tasks and the activities of daily living, an increased duration of illness and more frequent relapses. Objectives To determine the clinical effects of antidepressant medication for the treatment of depression in people who also suffer with schizophrenia. Search methods We undertook electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2000), ClinPsych (1988‐2000), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2000), EMBASE (1980‐2000) and MEDLINE (1966‐2000). This was supplemented by citation searching, personal contact with authors and pharmaceutical companies. We updated this search January 2013 and added 71 new trials to the awaiting assessment section. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials that compared antidepressant medication with placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were also suffering from depression. Data collection and analysis Data were independently selected and extracted. For homogeneous dichotomous data the fixed effects risk difference (RD), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences. Statistical tests for heterogeneity were also undertaken. Main results Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All were small, and randomised fewer than 30 people to each group. Most included people after the most acute phase of psychosis and investigated a wide range of antidepressants. The quality of reporting varied a great deal. For the outcome of 'no important clinical response' antidepressants were significantly better than placebo (n=209, 5 RCTs, summary risk difference fixed effects ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.13, NNT 4 95% CI 3 to 8). The depression score at the end of the trial, as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale (HAM‐D), seemed to suggest that using antidepressants was beneficial, but this was only statistically significant when a fixed effects model was used (n=261, 6 RCTs, WMD fixed effects ‐2.2 95% CI ‐3.8 to ‐0.6; WMD random effects ‐2.1 95% CI ‐5.04 to 0.84). There was no evidence that antidepressant treatment led to a deterioration of psychotic symptoms in the included trials. Heterogeneous data on 'any adverse effect' are equivocal (n=110, 2 RCTs, RD fixed 0.11 CI ‐0.03 to 0.25, Chi square 7.5, df=1, p=0.0062). In one small study extrapyramidal adverse effects were reported less often by those allocated to antidepressant (n=52, 1 RCT, RD fixed ‐0.28 CI ‐0.5 to ‐0.04). Only about 10% of people left these studies by 12 weeks. There was no apparent difference between those allocated placebo and those given an antidepressant (n=426, 10 RCTs, RD fixed 0.04 CI ‐0.02 to 0.1). Authors' conclusions Overall, the literature was of poor quality, and only a small number of trials made useful contributions. Though our results provide some evidence to indicate that antidepressants may be beneficial for people with depression and schizophrenia, the results, at best, are likely to overestimate the treatment effect, and, at worst, could merely reflect selective reporting of statistically significant results and publication bias. At present, there is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of antidepressants in treating depression in people with schizophrenia. We need further well‐designed, conducted and reported research to determine the best approach towards treating depression in people with schizophrenia. Note: the 71 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Antidepressants for people with both schizophrenia and depression Depression is common in people with schizophrenia and is associated with substantial problems including an increased risk of suicide. Many clinicians use antidepressant drugs in addition to anti‐psychotics in order to treat depression. This review identified eleven randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressants with a placebo in people with schizophrenia who also had depression. There was some evidence that antidepressants did lead to an improvement in global outcome, but the small number of studies providing usable data and their poor quality, suggest that this evidence should be interpreted with caution. At present, there is no convincing evidence either to support or refute the use of antidepressants in treating depression in people with schizophrenia. Further well‐designed, conducted and reported research is needed in this area.

AB: Abstract - Background Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Newer generation antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often used, however evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Objectives To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Search methods For this update of the review, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 ‐), MEDLINE (1950 ‐) and PsycINFO (1967 ‐). We searched clinical trial registries and pharmaceutical company websites. We checked reference lists of included trials and other reviews, and sent letters to key researchers and the pharmaceutical companies of included trials from January to August 2011. Selection criteria Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over trials and cluster trials comparing a newer generation antidepressant with a placebo in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old and diagnosed with a depressive disorder were eligible for inclusion. In this update, we amended the selection criteria to include newer generation antidepressants rather than SSRIs only. Data collection and analysis Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a random‐effects meta‐analysis. We used risk ratio (RR) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) to summarise continuous measures. Main results Nineteen trials of a range of newer antidepressants compared with placebo, containing 3335 participants, were included. The trials excluded young people at high risk of suicide and many co‐morbid conditions and the participants are likely to be less unwell than those seen in clinical practice. We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high drop out rates and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials. Overall, there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores and higher rates of response/remission than those on placebo. However, the size of these effects was small with a reduction in depression symptoms of 3.51 on a scale from 17 to 113 (14 trials; N = 2490; MD ‐3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.55 to ‐2.47). Remission rates increased from 380 per 1000 to 448 per 1000 for those treated with an antidepressant. There was evidence of an increased risk (58%) of suicide‐related outcome for those on antidepressants compared with a placebo (17 trials; N = 3229; RR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.45). This equates to an increased risk in a group with a median baseline risk from 25 in 1000 to 40 in 1000. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that the magnitude of intervention effects (compared with placebo) were modified by individual drug class. Authors' conclusions Caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. Further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. However, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. Clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide‐related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications. Plain language summary Newer antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents Depression is common in young people and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, such as poor academic functioning, difficulties in peer and family relationships, increases in substance use, and both attempted and completed suicide. This review contained 19 trials (with a total of 3353 participants) testing the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants (these are antidepressants developed and used since tricyclic antidepressants were developed). These include the well‐known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have an impact primarily on the brain chemical called serotonin, as well as several other newer classes of antidepressants now being used, which aim to target noradrenaline and dopamine as well as serotonin and include selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs)) for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Based on 14 of the trials (2490 participants in total), there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores than those on placebo, however, the size of this difference was small. Based on 17 trials (3229 participants in total), there was evidence of an increased risk (64%) of suicide‐related outcomes for those on antidepressants compared with those given placebo. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that one particular type of newer generation antidepressant had a larger effect than the others when compared to placebo. It is unclear how meaningful the results regarding the effectiveness of these medications are in terms of a young person's day‐to‐day functioning. Children and adolescents with other conditions (such as anxiety, substance use disorder or a conduct disorder) as well as depression, and those at risk of suicide, were often excluded from trials. However, these young people are more representative of the population who present to clinical services, therefore it is not possible to predict how they would respond to antidepressants. There was often insufficient information to judge the quality of the trials accurately. With these limitations, it is difficult to answer questions about the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for treating depression in children and adolescents. Clinicians need to provide accurate information to children and adolescents, and their families, about the uncertainties regarding the benefits and risks of newer generation antidepressant medication as a treatment option for depression. If a decision to use medication is agreed then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations and, if used, the risk of suicide should be assessed and monitored particularly closely.

AB: Abstract - Background Haloperidol is a benchmark, accessible antipsychotic drug against which the effects of newer treatments are gauged. Objectives To determine the best range of doses for haloperidol for the treatment of people acutely ill with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria We selected studies if they involved people being treated for acute schizophrenia, randomised to two or more dose ranges of non‐depot haloperidol, and if they reported clinically meaningful outcomes. Data collection and analysis For this update, we inspected all citations and independently re‐inspected a sample of citations in order to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and where doubt remained, we acquired the full‐text article for further inspection. We then ordered papers, and reliably re‐inspected and quality assessed the full reports, and extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. We assumed that people who left the study early or were lost to follow‐up had a negative outcome. We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes that reported ITT, last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. We excluded data if loss to follow‐up was greater than 50%. Main results We included 19 trials with 19 different randomised dose comparisons. No studies reported data on relapse rates or quality of life and only one compared low dose (> 1.5 to 3 mg/day) haloperidol to higher dose ranges. Using standard lower dose (> 3 to 7.5 mg/day) did not result in loss of efficacy (no clinically important improvement in global state, versus standard higher dose (> 7.5 to 15 mg/day, n = 48, 1 RCT, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.8,  very‐low‐quality evidence ); versus high dose (> 15 to 35 mg/day, n = 81, 2 RCTs, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2,  very‐low‐quality evidence ). Doses of haloperidol in the range of > 3 to 7.5 mg/day had a lower rate of development of clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects than higher doses (clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects, versus standard higher dose, n = 64, 2 RCTs, RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.1,  very‐low‐quality evidence ); versus high dose, n = 144, 3 RCTs, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8, very‐low‐quality evidence; versus very high dose (> 35 mg/day, n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.1,  very‐low‐quality evidence ). None of the other comparisons between dose ranges yielded statistically significant differences, but several, particularly with lower dose ranges, were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences. Authors' conclusions Noresults were conclusive and all were based on small, short studies of limited quality. However, it would be understandable if clinicians were cautious in prescribing doses in excess of 7.5 mg/day of haloperidol to a person with uncomplicated acute schizophrenia, and if people with schizophrenia were equally reticent to take greater doses. Further research is needed regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the lower dose ranges, especially > 1.5 to 3 mg/day. Plain language summary Haloperidol dose for the acute phase of schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental illness where the person often experiences both positive symptoms (such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs) and negative symptoms (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide for people with schizophrenia. The benefits of antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, need to be weighed against their tendency for causing debilitating side effects (such as movement disorders, weight gain, lack of drive) and in some cases an increased likelihood of physical illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. These debilitating side effects may mean that people stop taking their medication, which can lead to relapse and going into hospital. It is, therefore, important to find a tolerable and effective dose of haloperidol, which helps control the symptoms of schizophrenia but with fewer side effects. The main aim of this review was to determine the best range of doses of haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia. Nineteen trials were included that compared varying doses of haloperidol. Despite over 30 years of trials, data on the effects of differing doses of haloperidol are sparse and poorly reported. This is especially so for the lower dose ranges generally used for the treatment of schizophrenia today. However, lower doses of haloperidol may be just as effective as higher doses but result in fewer side effects. This review also suggests that an important bias against haloperidol may exist in modern trials comparing new drugs with haloperidol. Results are not conclusive and are based on small, short studies of limited quality. The authors of the review note that it would be understandable if psychiatrists were cautious about prescribing doses above 7.5 mg a day and if people with schizophrenia did not want to take higher dosages. Further research is needed to assess the tolerability and effectiveness of lower doses. Low doses of haloperidol may be just as good as higher doses, but with fewer side effects.

AB: Abstract - Background Snoezelen, multi‐sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils. The rationale for this lies in the proposition that the provision of a sensory environment for people with dementia places fewer demands on their intellectual abilities but capitalizes on their residual sensorimotor abilities. The clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make the examination of the therapeutic values of snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions. Objectives To examine the clinical efficacy of snoezelen (or multisensory stimulation) for older people with dementia and their caregivers. Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 23 March 2008 using the terms: snoezelen OR "multi‐sensory*". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases ( The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources. The reviewers hand‐searched PubMed and the ISI Web of Science. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials in which snoezelen or multi‐sensory programmes was used as an intervention for older people suffering from any forms of dementia. Data collection and analysis The two reviewers independently reviewed and assessed the quality of the trials. Main results Two new trials were included in this update. Baker 2003 was an expanded study of Baker 2001 reported in the previous version. Both Baker 2003 and van Weert 2005 examined the short‐term and longer‐term effects of snoezelen on behaviour, mood, and communication of people with moderate to severe dementia. The format of implementation was different in the two trials: one was session‐based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003), whilst the other was a 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005). Owing to the differences in study methodology, the results of the two trials were not pooled for analysis. The session‐based snoezelen programme (Baker 2003) did not show any effects on behaviour, mood, cognition and communication / interaction in the short term (during or immediately after sessions) or longer term (at post‐intervention or 1‐month post‐intervention follow‐up). Likewise, the 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care (van Weert 2005) failed to demonstrate any significant short‐term and longer term effects on behaviour, mood and interaction. Authors' conclusions A more vigorous review methodology was adopted in this update. The study of Kragt 1997, reported in the previous version, was excluded because the snoezelen programme only consisted of three sessions, which was considered too brief for a therapeutic intervention. Two new trials were reviewed. Meta‐analyses could not be performed because of the limited number of trials and different study methods of the available trials. Overall, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of snoezelen for dementia. There is a need for more reliable and sound research‐based evidence to inform and justify the use of snoezelen in dementia care. Plain language summary No evidence of the efficacy of snoezelen or multi‐sensory stimulation programmes for people with dementia Snoezelen (or multi‐sensory stimulation) has become a commonly used intervention to manage maladaptive behaviours and to promote positive mood of older people with dementia. Originally, two randomised clinical trials were available for this review. Some short‐term benefits were documented in promoting adaptive behaviours in people with dementia during and immediately after their participation in the sessions. In this update, two new trials were included and revealed two different forms of applying snoezelen to dementia care. One is a session‐based snoezelen programme while the other is a 24‐hour integrated snoezelen care programme. Both trials did not show any significant effects on behaviour, interaction, and mood of people with dementia.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012029.pub2
AB: Abstract - Background Bifeprunox is a novel antipsychotic drug designed to treat schizophrenia. However, research into the drug was ceased in 2009 due to rejection of licence to go to market by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who could not approve the drug for acute or long‐term symptoms of schizophrenia because more research was required to demonstrate convincing effects "beyond those already achieved" with currently licenced drugs. There were also concerns expressed over one death of a person whilst on the drug. Objectives To investigate the clinical and adverse effects of bifeprunox for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register on 23 October 2015, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on bifeprunox versus placebo for schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Main results We included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found evidence of missing data and poor reporting. When bifeprunox 20 mg was compared with placebo for schizophrenia, the drug resulted in a reduction of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score regarding positive symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD ‐1.89, 95% CI ‐2.85 to ‐0.92,  low‐quality evidence ) and the PANSS negative subscale regarding negative symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐2.37 to ‐0.69,  low‐quality evidence ). There was a clear improvement regarding deterioration in the bifeprunox 20 mg group (n = 231, 1 RCT, RR 0.71 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.93,  very low‐quality evidence ). The total number of participants with equal to or greater than 7% weight increase was similar between bifeprunox and placebo (n = 483, 1 RCT, RR 1.02 95% CI 0.31 to 3.33  moderate‐quality evidence ). There were no useable data for quality of life, economic outcomes, and service use. Authors' conclusions Our results showed some positive effects and a favourable adverse effect profile for bifeprunox, although there were few data overall and none were of high quality. It would seem that these data alone would not have been enough for the FDA to decide to halt progress of the drug to market. We can only assume that we are missing important data. Both the FDA and the relevant pharmaceutical companies have not made all relevant data accessible. As some of these trials also involved an additional haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone arm, these data are not only relevant to evaluation of bifeprunox. In not making all data accessible, it is hard to see how the FDA and the drug companies have fulfilled their full obligations to people with schizophrenia or their clinicians. Plain language summary Bifeprunox compared with placebo for schizophrenia Review question Is the antipsychotic bifeprunox an effective and safe treatment option for people with schizophrenia? Background Bifeprunox is an antipsychotic, developed to treat schizophrenia. It was thought to be effective for symptoms of schizophrenia whilst causing fewer of the side effects associated with other antipsychotics. However, in 2009 research into the drug was stopped , as it was considered to be no more effective than other available treatments, and there were concerns over the death of one person whilst on the drug. However, as many people with schizophrenia are resistant to current treatments, there is a need to explore new options. Bifeprunox was one of these. We reviewed the available evidence for efficacy, safety, and side effects of bifeprunox, in part to aid in understanding why use of the drug was halted. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched the specialised register in October 2015. He ran an electronic search for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either bifeprunox or placebo, finding 42 records. The review authors screened these for inclusion in the review. Evidence found Only four trials provided useable data, and these were of poor quality with some evidence of missing data. Two trials are completed but not yet published; we could not obtain any information from these trials that we could use in this review. The data available to us showed that bifeprunox improved participants' scores on both positive and negative symptom scales. Weight increase was similar between those receiving bifeprunox and those allocated to placebo. Conclusions Data regarding the effects of bifeprunox are scarce. The data we found, which were of poor quality, showed no real evidence that bifeprunox is unsafe or ineffective. Its effects do not seem significantly different to other drugs that are currently on the market. More data on this compound exists but is not publicly available. We believe that the licencing authority in the USA must have had more information on which to base their important decision. The drug company also seemed to lose the will to move forward with bifeprunox. Whether or not the decision to prohibit access to a potentially useful drug was taken because of clear evidence of adverse effects, market calculations, or biases, it would seem an omission that all information upon which this decision was made is not in the public domain.

AB: Abstract - Background Many drug treatments have been proposed for the treatment of dysthymia, but with so many potential comparisons it is not possible at the present time to determine which is the treatment of choice. There is a need to know whether the different classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy. In addition, the tolerability of treatments may be even more important, since dysthymia is a chronic condition characterised by less severe symptoms than major depression. Objectives To conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials comparing two or more active drug treatments for dysthymia. Search methods Electronic searches of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT and LILACS, Biological Abstracts; reference searching; personal communication; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry. Selection criteria Only randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to compare at least two active drug treatments in the treatment of dysthymia. Exclusion criteria were: non‐randomised studies, studies which included patients with mixed major depression/dysthymia and studies on depression/dysthymia secondary to other disorders (e.g. substance abuse). Data collection and analysis The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption. Main results A total of 14 trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. All studied drugs promoted similar clinical responses, although with different side effect profiles. The evidence for TCAs and SSRIs was the most robust, considering the number of trials and participants. Authors' conclusions The conclusion is that the choice of drug must be made based on consideration of drug‐specific side effect properties.

AB: Abstract - Background Long‐acting depot injections of drugs such as flupenthixol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long‐term maintenance treatment for schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot neuroleptic preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses, in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Search methods We identified relevant trials by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in March 2009 and then for this update version, a search was run in April 2013. The register is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that focused on people with schizophrenia or other similar psychotic disorders where flupenthixol decanoate had been compared with placebo or other antipsychotic drugs were included. All clinically relevant outcomes were sought. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. We summated normal continuous data using mean difference (MD), and 95% CIs using a fixed‐effect model. We presented scale data only for those tools that had attained prespecified levels of quality. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) we created 'Summary of findings tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results The review currently includes 15 randomised controlled trials with 626 participants. No trials compared flupenthixol decanoate with placebo. One small study compared flupenthixol decanoate with an oral antipsychotic (penfluridol). Only two outcomes were reported with this single study, and it demonstrated no clear differences between the two preparations as regards leaving the study early (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 3.00, CI 0.33 to 27.23, very low quality evidence ) and requiring anticholinergic medication (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.19, CI 0.77 to 1.83,  very low quality evidence ). Ten studies in total compared flupenthixol decanoate with other depot preparations, though not all studies reported on all outcomes of interest. There were no significant differences between depots for outcomes such as relapse at medium term (n = 221, 5 RCTs, RR 1.30, CI 0.87 to 1.93,  low quality evidence ), and no clinical improvement at short term (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.67, CI 0.36 to 1.23,  low quality evidence ). There was no difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early at short/medium term (n = 161, 4 RCTs, RR 1.23, CI 0.76 to 1.99,  low quality evidence ) nor with numbers of people requiring anticholinergic medication at short/medium term (n = 102, 3 RCTs, RR 1.38, CI 0.75 to 2.25,  low quality evidence ). Three studies in total compared high doses (100 to 200 mg) of flupenthixol decanoate with the standard doses (˜40mg) per injection. Two trials found relapse at medium term (n = 18, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.27 to 3.69,  low quality evidence ) to be similar between the groups. However people receiving a high dose had slightly more favourable medium term mental state results on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD ‐10.44, CI ‐18.70 to ‐2.18,  low quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in the use of anticholinergic medications to deal with side effects at short term (2 RCTs n = 47, RR 1.12, CI 0.83 to 1.52  very low quality evidence ). One trial comparing a very low dose of flupenthixol decanoate (˜6 mg) with a low dose (˜9 mg) per injection reported no difference in relapse rates (n = 59, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, CI 0.10 to 1.15,  low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions In the current state of evidence, there is nothing to choose between flupenthixol decanoate and other depot antipsychotics. From the data reported in clinical trials, it would be understandable to offer standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. However, data reported are of low or very low quality and this review highlights the need for large, well‐designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the effects of flupenthixol decanoate. Plain language summary Depot flupenthixol decanoate for schizophrenia or other similar mental illnesses Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects thinking and perception. It often develops in early adult‐hood and can have a lifelong impact on not only the mental well‐being of the sufferer, but their social and general functioning. Worldwide around 15 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with schizophrenia every year. The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotics are usually given as tablets by mouth (orally). However, people with mental illness often have difficulties with accepting medication (compliance). Their illness affects their thinking, which can erode their understanding of their illness and they often do not see the need for treatment. Taking antipsychotics can also have unpleasant side effects. Oral medication requires regular self‐administration otherwise effectiveness is reduced and the risk of relapse is high. A solution to poor compliance is depot medication where medication is given by injection and is slowly released over a period of weeks. For people with schizophrenia it was hoped to be able to maintain care in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses. Initial enthusiasm and the favourable results of clinical trials gave rise to the extensive use of depots as a means of long‐term treatment. Flupenthixol decanoate is one of the most widely used depot antipsychotics in the UK. This review looks at the effectiveness of depot flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with no active treatment (placebo), oral antipsychotics and other depot preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. An electronic search for relevant trials was carried out in 2013. Fifteen trials with 626 participants could be included. All evidence from these trials was rated by the authors to be  low  or  very low quality.  Currently, from the data reported, there is nothing to choose between depot flupenthixol decanoate and other depot or oral antipsychotics. There was some evidence that it would be understandable to offer a standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. Overall, this review highlights the lack of evidence based information available for the review question and the need for large, well‐designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the medical, social, personal and economic effects of flupenthixol decanoate.

AB: Abstract - Background In traditional didactic teaching, the learner has a passive role, digesting the knowledge presented by the teacher. Stimulating and active teaching processes may be better at instilling information than more pedestrian approaches. Games involving repetition, reinforcement, association and use of multiple senses have been proposed as part of experiential learning. Objectives To assess the effects of educational games on the knowledge attainment and clinical skills of mental health professionals compared to the effects of standard teaching approaches. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2005), AMED (1998 ‐ November 2005), British Nursing Index (November 2005), Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2005), CINAHL (November 2005) EMBASE (November 2005), Educational Resources Information Centre on CSA (1966 ‐ November 2005), MEDLINE (November 2005) and PsycINFO (November 2005). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing any educational game aiming at increasing knowledge and/or skills with a standard educational approach for mental health professionals. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For individual person data we calculated the Odds Ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a fixed effects model. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed effects model. Main results We identified one trial (n=34) of an educational game for mental health nursing students of only a few hours follow up. For an outcome we arbitrarily defined ('no academically important improvement [a 10% improvement in scores]') those allocated to educational games fared considerably better than students in the standard education techniques group (OR 0.06 CI 0.01 to 0.3, NNT 3 CI 2 to 4). On average those in the games group scored six more points than the control students on a test of questions relevant to psychosis set to the standard of the mental health nursing curriculum of the day (WMD 6.00 CI 2.6 to 9.4). Authors' conclusions Current limited evidence suggests educational games could help mental health students gain more points in their tests, especially if they have left revision to the last minute. This salient study should be refined and repeated. Plain language summary Educational games for mental health professionals Standard teaching techniques in health care often contain traditional didactic elements. Learning from traditional didactic teaching has never been a very active process and can subsequently be tedious and tiring. In this review we wished to investigate the effects of more interactive ways of teaching mental health professionals. We identified one relevant trial which, although very small and short, did suggest quite a considerable short term positive effect for the more interactive teaching approach. On average, mental health nursing students who had been taught using this method scored six points more in a follow‐up test than students allocated to the standard teaching techniques. This interesting experiment should be reproduced to determine whether the increased knowledge is sustained and, if so, whether this produces better skills and attitudes.

AB: Abstract - Background A token economy is a behavioural therapy technique in which the desired change is achieved by means of tokens administered for the performance of predefined behaviours according to a program. Though token economy programmes were widespread in the 1970s they became largely restricted to wards where long‐stay patients from institutions are prepared for transfer into the community and were particularly aimed at changing negative symptoms of schizophrenia ‐ poor motivation, poor attention and social withdrawal. Objectives To review the effects of token economies for people with schizophrenia, or other serious or chronic mental illnesses, compared with standard care. Search methods Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1985‐1999), CINAHL (1982‐1998), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (February 1999), EMBASE (1980‐1999) and PsycLIT (1987‐1998) were supplemented with reference searches, personal contact with trial authors and hand searches. Selection criteria Randomised studies comparing a token economy regime (one in which change is achieved by means of use of non‐monetary, non‐consumable tokens) to standard care for those with schizophrenia or any other similar chronic or serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated. Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. Normal continuous data were summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD). Scale data were presented only for those tools that had attained pre‐specified levels of quality. Main results Only three randomised controlled trials could be included in the analyses (total n=110). There were no usable data on target or non‐target behaviour. One small study favoured the token economy approach for the outcome 'change in mental state' on the SANS‐CV with improvement in negative symptoms at three months (n=40, WMD ‐12.7, CI ‐21.44 to ‐3.96). Authors' conclusions The token economy approach may have effects on negative symptoms but it is unclear if these results are reproducible, clinically meaningful and are maintained beyond the treatment programme. Token economy remains worthy of careful evaluation in well designed, conducted and reported randomised trials. Plain language summary Token economy for schizophrenia Synopsis pending.

AB: Abstract - Background Tricyclic antidepressants are still extensively prescribed worldwide. Evidence for the recommended dosage of tricyclics, however, is poor. Objectives To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression. Search methods Electronic search of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966‐), EMBASE (1980‐), CINAHL (1982‐), PsycLIT (1974‐), PSYNDEX (1977‐) and LILACS (1982‐1999) and hand searches of major psychiatric and medical journals. Reference search and SciSearch of the identified studies. Personal contact with authors of significant papers. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials 1) comparing low dosage TCA (=< 100 mg/d on average at the end of trial) with placebo or 2) comparing low and standard dosages of the same TCA, in acute phase treatment of depressive disorder Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers examined eligibility of the identified studies, and extracted data for outcomes at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6‐8 weeks and later. Main outcome measures were relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors' definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression according to the last‐observation‐carried‐forward intention‐to‐treat method, and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Other outcome measures included worst‐case‐scenario intention‐to‐treat analysis of response as defined above (in which dropouts were considered non‐responders in the active treatment group and as responders in the comparison group), and standardised weighted mean scores of continuous depression severity scales (usually calculated by last‐observation‐carried‐forward method). Main results 35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6‐8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics. Authors' conclusions Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of varying dosages. Plain language summary Low dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for depression Practicing physicians and psychiatrists have often been criticised for administering too low a dosage of tricyclic antidepressants for people with depression. This systematic review of 39 studies (2564 participants) found that tricyclic antidepressants between 75‐100 mg/day and possibly below this range result in more reduction in depression than placebo. On the other hand, there was no strong evidence to show that standard dosage tricyclic brings about more response than low dosage tricyclic. The findings suggest that administration of low dosage tricyclic antidepressant is a defensible practice.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second generation ("atypical") antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics. Objectives To evaluate the effects of olanzapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods 1. Electronic searching   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 2. Reference searching   We inspected the reference of all identified studies for more trials. 3. Personal contact   We contacted the first author of each included study for missing information. 4. Drug companies   We contacted the manufacturers of all atypical antipsychotics included for additional data. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials that used at least single‐blind (rater‐blind) design, comparing oral olanzapine with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random effects model. Main results The review currently includes 50 studies and 9476 participants which provided data for six comparisons (olanzapine compared to amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone). The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) more than aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=794, WMD ‐4.96 CI ‐8.06 to ‐1.85), quetiapine (10 RCTs, n=1449, WMD ‐3.66 CI ‐5.39 to ‐1.93), risperidone (15 RCTs, n=2390, WMD ‐1.94 CI ‐3.31 to ‐0.58) and ziprasidone (4 RCTs, n=1291, WMD ‐8.32 CI ‐10.99 to ‐5.64), but not more than amisulpride or clozapine. This somewhat better efficacy was confirmed by fewer participants in the olanzapine groups leaving the studies early due to inefficacy of treatment compared to quetiapine (8 RCTs, n=1563, RR 0.56 CI 0.44 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 6 to 50), risperidone (14 RCTs, n=2744, RR 0.78 CI 0.62 to 0.98, NNT 50 CI 17 to 100) and ziprasidone (5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 0.64 CI 0.51 to 0.79, NNT 17, CI 11 to 33). Fewer participants in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=876, RR 0.56 CI 0.41 to 0.77, NNT 11 CI 7 to 25) and ziprasidone (2 RCTs, n=766, RR 0.65 CI 0.45 to 0.93, NNT 17 CI 9 to 100) treatment groups, but not in the clozapine group (1 RCT, n=980, RR 1.28 CI 1.02 to 1.61, NNH not estimable), had to be re‐hospitalised in the trials. Except for clozapine, all comparators induced less weight gain than olanzapine (olanzapine compared to amisulpride: 3 RCTs, n=671, WMD 2.11kg CI 1.29kg to 2.94kg; aripiprazole: 1 RCT, n=90, WMD 5.60kg CI 2.15kg to 9.05kg; quetiapine: 7 RCTs, n=1173, WMD 2.68kg CI 1.10kg to 4.26kg; risperidone: 13 RCTs, n=2116, WMD 2.61kg CI 1.48kg to 3.74kg; ziprasidone: 5 RCTs, n=1659, WMD 3.82kg CI 2.96kg to 4.69kg). Associated problems such as glucose and cholesterol increase were usually also more frequent in the olanzapine group. Other differences in adverse effects were less well documented. Nevertheless, olanzapine may be associated with slightly more extrapyramidal side effects than quetiapine (use of antiparkinson medication (6 RCTs, n=1090, RR 2.05 CI 1.26 to 3.32, NNH 25 CI 14 to 100), but less than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication 13 RCTs, n=2599, RR 0.78 CI 0.65 to 0.95, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100) and ziprasidone (use of antiparkinson medication 4 RCTs, n=1732, RR 0.70 CI 0.50 to 0.97, NNH not estimable). It may also increase prolactin somewhat more than aripiprazole, clozapine and quetiapine, but clearly less so than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=1291, WMD ‐22.84 CI ‐27.98 to ‐17.69). Authors' conclusions Olanzapine may be a somewhat more efficacious drug than some other second generation antipsychotic drugs. This small superiority in efficacy needs to be weighed against a larger weight gain and associated metabolic problems than most other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except clozapine. These conclusions are tentative due to the large number of people leaving the studies early which possibly limits the validity of the findings. Further large, well‐designed trials are necessary to establish the relative effects of different second generation antipsychotic drugs. Plain language summary Olanzapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review examined the effects of olanzapine compared to other second generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 50 relevant studies with 9476 participants, comparing olanzapine with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. Comparisons of olanzapine with the second generation antipsychotic drugs sertindole or zotepine are currently not available. Olanzapine was somewhat more efficacious than aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, whereas there was no efficacy difference compared to amisulpride and clozapine. The main disadvantage of olanzapine was its higher weight gain and associated metabolic problems compared to all other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except for clozapine.

AB: Abstract - Background In many countries of the industrialised world second‐generation ("atypical") antipsychotics (SGAs) have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether and if so how much the effects of the various SGAs differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone differs from that of other SGAs. Objectives To evaluate the effects of risperidone compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods 1. Electronic searching   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 2. Reference searching   We inspected the references of all identified studies for more trials. 3. Personal contact   We contacted the first author of each included study for missing information. 4. Drug companies   We contacted the manufacturers of all atypical antipsychotics included for additional data. Selection criteria We included all randomised, blinded trials comparing oral risperidone with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 45 blinded RCTs with 7760 participants. The number of RCTs available for each comparison varied: four studies compared risperidone with amisulpride, two with aripiprazole, 11 with clozapine, 23 with olanzapine, eleven with quetiapine, two with sertindole, three with ziprasidone and none with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (46.9%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Furthermore, 60% were industry sponsored, which can be a source of bias. There were few significant differences in overall acceptability of treatment as measured by leaving the studies early. Risperidone was slightly less acceptable than olanzapine, and slightly more acceptable than ziprasidone in this regard. Risperidone improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) slightly less than olanzapine (15 RCTs, n = 2390, MD 1.94 CI 0.58 to 3.31), but slightly more than quetiapine (9 RCTs, n = 1953, MD ‐3.09 CI ‐5.16 to ‐1.01) and ziprasidone (3 RCTs, n = 1016, MD ‐3.91 CI ‐7.55 to ‐0.27). The comparisons with the other SGA drugs were equivocal. Risperidone was also less efficacious than olanzapine and clozapine in terms of leaving the studies early due to inefficacy, but more efficacious than ziprasidone in the same outcome. Risperidone produced somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects than a number of other SGAs (use of antiparkinson medication versus clozapine 6 RCTs, n = 304, RR 2.57 CI 1.47 to 4.48, NNH 6 CI 33 to 3; versus olanzapine 13 RCTs, n = 2599, RR 1.28 CI 1.06 to 1.55, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100; versus quetiapine 6 RCTs, n = 1715, RR 1.98 CI 1.16 to 3.39, NNH 20 CI 10 to 100; versus ziprasidone 2 RCTs, n = 822, RR 1.42 CI 1.03 to 1.96, NNH not estimable; parkinsonism versus sertindole 1 RCT, n = 321, RR 4.11 CI 1.44 to 11.73, NNH 14 CI 100 to 8). Risperidone also increased prolactin levels clearly more than all comparators, except for amisulpride and sertindole for which no data were available. Other adverse events were less consistently reported, but risperidone may well produce more weight gain and/or associated metabolic problems than amisulpride (weight gain: 3 RCTs, n = 585, MD 0.99 CI 0.37 to 1.61), aripiprazole (cholesterol increase: 1 RCT, n = 83, MD 22.30 CI 4.91 to 39.69) and ziprasidone (cholesterol increase 2 RCTs, n = 767, MD 8.58 CI 1.11 to 16.04) but less than clozapine (weight gain 3 RCTs n = 373, MD ‐3.30 CI ‐5.65 to ‐0.95), olanzapine (weight gain 13 RCTs, n = 2116, MD ‐2.61 CI ‐3.74 to ‐1.48), quetiapine (cholesterol increase: 5 RCTs, n = 1433, MD ‐8.49 CI ‐12. 23 to ‐4.75) and sertindole (weight gain: 2 RCTs, n = 328, MD ‐0.99 CI ‐1.86 to ‐0.12). It may be less sedating than clozapine and quetiapine, lengthen the QTc interval less than sertindole (QTc change: 2 RCTs, n = 495, MD ‐18.60 CI ‐22.37 to 14.83), produce fewer seizures than clozapine (2 RCTs, n = 354, RR 0.22 CI 0.07 to 0.70, NNT 14 CI 8 to 33) and less sexual dysfunction in men than sertindole (2 RCTs, n = 437, RR 0.34 CI 0.16 to 0.76, NNT 13 CI 8 to 33). Authors' conclusions Risperidone seems to produce somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects and clearly more prolactin increase than most other SGAs. It may also differ from other compounds in efficacy and in the occurrence of other adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic problems, cardiac effects, sedation and seizures. Nevertheless, the large proportion of participants leaving studies early and incomplete reporting of outcomes makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Further large trials, especially comparing risperidone with those other new drugs for which only a few RCTs are available, are needed. Plain language summary Risperidone versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia This review examines the effects of risperidone compared to other second‐generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs for schizophrenia. We identified 45 relevant studies with 7760 participants comparing risperidone with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole and ziprasidone. Comparisons of risperidone with zotepine are currently not available. Risperidone was somewhat more successful than quetiapine and ziprasidone, but somewhat less successful than clozapine and olanzapine. The main disadvantage of risperidone were more frequent movement disorders and more prolactin increase compared to most other SGA drugs.
