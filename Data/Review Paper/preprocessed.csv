At all levels of experience and expertise, they are called on to change. In the health care context, “practice” has multiple meanings. Practice, in the sense of “the clinical scope of work we do every day” corresponds to Merriam Webster’s first definition of the word, “to be professionally engaged in” or “to do or perform often, customarily, or habitually.” In this editorial, the authors call upon their colleagues to recognize the second definition of “practice” and build in opportunities to “train by repeated exercises” within day to day clinical activity. By this they mean, build in mechanisms to prompt reflection on your work, every day, seeking and incorporating feedback from others on your team. Effective primary care systems protect time for practice and learning. These organizations demonstrate “adaptive reserve,” consisting of action and reflection cycles, facilitative leadership, a learning culture, the ability to improvise, and effective relationships and communication.

This study examined distinct features of the neighborhood, including youth-serving institutional resources (YSI) and safety, as they relate to PYD among adolescents from low-income neighborhoods in an urban setting (n = 491, 68.6% African American). Because neighborhood experiences during adolescence often differ based on gender, we also examined moderation by gender. Results from cross-sectional, multilevel data suggest that neighborhood safety, YSIs, and gender are differentially associated with indicators of PYD (i.e., hope, mastery, friend support). The pattern of results suggested that when associated with mastery, YSIs may compensate for low-safety neighborhoods for adolescent females but not males. In terms of associations with friend support, YSIs may foster the development of PYD in low-safety neighborhoods for males but not females. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

The mean age was 26.8 years. Around 90% had post-high school education. The self-reported HIV prevalence was 12.3%. The acceptability of sexual health content was greater in the most highly educated group. The highest rated topics and services of interest were those related to improving sexual and mental health. The least educated group was significantly more interested in ""getting prevention messages on mobiles"" compared to men with the highest level of education (71% vs. 52%; p < 0.001). Men\s sexual health was of more interest to the 30-39-year-old group compared to the 18-24-year-old one (97% vs. 87%; p = 0.005). Future Web-based interventions related to sexual health among targeted groups of MSM in Peru can be tailored to meet their preferences."

At baseline and 8-week follow-up we assessed primary outcomes of psychological and cancer-specific distress and unmet psychological supportive care needs and secondary outcomes of positive adjustment and quality of life., RESULTS: , Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a statistically significant intervention effect on primary or secondary outcomes. However, per-protocol analyses found a greater decrease for the CancerCope group in psychological distress (P=.04), cancer-specific distress (P=.02), and unmet psychological care needs (P=.03) from baseline to 8 weeks compared with the patient education group. Younger patients were more likely to complete the CancerCope intervention., CONCLUSIONS: , This online CBT intervention was associated with greater decreases in distress for those patients who more closely adhered to the program.

Although some face-to-face family-based interventions for adolescent alcohol misuse have been found to be effective, their public health impact is limited by their labour-intensiveness, poor uptake and low adherence. A web-based intervention has the potential to overcome many of these challenges, and was recently recommended by prevention experts as one key way to increase participation rates in preventative interventions. This paper describes the development of www.parentingstrategies.net , a website providing parenting guidelines and a tailored web-based intervention endorsed by longitudinal research evidence and expert consensus., CONCLUSIONS: , This website provides the first web-based preventative intervention for parents, and has great potential as a family friendly component in the spectrum of interventions that are critically needed to tackle the issue of adolescent alcohol misuse across the community."

Expanding from traditional face-to-face program delivery, there is growing interest in Web-based application of MBIs, though Web-based MBIs for people with physical health conditions specifically have not been thoroughly reviewed to date., OBJECTIVE: , The objective of this paper was to review Web-based MBIs for people with physical health conditions and to examine all outcomes reported (eg, efficacy or effectiveness for physical changes or psychological changes; feasibility)., METHODS: , Databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science were searched. Full-text English papers that described any Web-based MBI, examining any outcome, for people with chronic physical health conditions were included. Randomized, nonrandomized, controlled, and uncontrolled trials were all included. Extracted data included intervention characteristics, population characteristics, outcomes, and quality indicators. Intervention characteristics (eg, synchronicity and guidance) were examined as potential factors related to study outcomes., RESULTS: , Of 435 publications screened, 19 published papers describing 16 studies were included. They examined Web-based MBIs for people with cancer, chronic pain or fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), epilepsy, heart disease, tinnitus, and acquired brain injury. Overall, most studies reported positive effects of Web-based MBIs compared with usual care on a variety of outcomes including pain acceptance, coping measures, and depressive symptoms. There were mixed results regarding the effectiveness of Web-based MBIs compared with active control treatment conditions such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Condition-specific symptoms (eg, cancer-related fatigue and IBS symptoms) targeted by treatment had the largest effect size improvements following MBIs. Results are inconclusive regarding physical variables., CONCLUSIONS: , Preliminary evidence suggests that Web-based MBIs may be helpful in alleviating symptom burden that those with physical health conditions can experience, particularly when interventions are tailored for specific symptoms. There was no evidence of differences between synchronous versus asynchronous or facilitated versus self-directed Web-based MBIs. Future investigations of Web-based MBIs should evaluate the effects of program adherence, effects on mindfulness levels, and whether synchronous or asynchronous, or facilitated or self-directed interventions elicit greater improvements., Kirsti I Toivonen, Kristin Zernicke, Linda E Carlson.

Relative to early stage individuals, this late stage group may not benefit as much from existing psychosocial treatments. The intervention is a guided self-help, mindfulness based intervention (MBI) developed in consultation with consumers, designed specifically for web-based delivery, with email coaching support., METHODS/DESIGN: , This international RCT will involve a comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two 5-week adjunctive online self-management interventions: Mindfulness for Bipolar 2.0 and an active control (Psychoeducation for Bipolar). A total of 300 participants will be recruited primarily via social media channels. Main inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of BD (confirmed via a phone-administered structured diagnostic interview), no current mood episode, history of 10 or more mood episodes, no current psychotic features or active suicidality, under the care of a medical practitioner. Block randomisation will be used for allocation to the interventions, and participants will retain access to the program for 6months. Evaluations will be conducted at pre- and post- treatment, and at 3- and 6- months follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale (Brief QoL.BD), collected immediately post-intervention at 5weeks (T1). Secondary measures include BD-related symptoms (mania, depression, anxiety, stress), time to first relapse, functioning, sleep quality, social rhythm stability and resource use. Measurements will be collected online and via telephone assessments at baseline (T0), 5weeks (T1), three months (T2) and six months (T3). Candidate moderators (diagnosis, anxiety or substance comorbidities, demographics and current treatments) will be investigated as will putative therapeutic mechanisms including mindfulness, emotion regulation and self-compassion. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. Acceptability and any unwanted events (including adverse treatment reactions) will be documented and explored., DISCUSSION: , This definitive trial will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel QoL focused, mindfulness based, online guided self-help intervention for late stage BD, and investigate its putative mechanisms of therapeutic action., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , ClinicalTrials.gov : , NCT03197974,  .

Family caregivers experience poorer physical and mental health than their non-caregiving counterparts. Web-based interventions can provide accessible support to family caregivers to offset declines in their health and well-being. Existing reviews focused on web-based interventions for caregivers have been limited to single illness populations and have mostly focused on the efficacy of the interventions. We therefore have limited insight into how web-based interventions for family caregiver have been developed, implemented and evaluated across aging-related illness., OBJECTIVES: , ""To describe: a) theoretical underpinnings of the literature; b) development, content and delivery of web-based interventions; c) caregiver usage of web-based interventions; d) caregiver experience with web-based interventions and e) impact of web-based interventions on caregivers health outcomes."", METHODS: , ""We followed Arksey and OMalleys methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews which entails setting research questions, selecting relevant studies, charting the data and synthesizing the results in a report."", RESULTS: , Fifty-three publications representing 32 unique web-based interventions were included. Over half of the interventions were targeted at dementia caregivers, with the rest targeting caregivers to the stroke, cancer, diabetes and general frailty populations. Studies used theory across the intervention trajectory. Interventions aimed to improve a range of health outcomes for caregivers through static and interactive delivery methods Caregivers were satisfied with the usability and accessibility of the websites but usage was generally low and declined over time. Depression and caregiver burden were the most common outcomes evaluated. The interventions ranged in their impact on health and social outcomes but reductions in perception of caregiver burden were consistently observed., CONCLUSIONS: , Caregivers value interactive interventions that are tailored to their unique needs and the illness context. However, usage of the interventions was sporadic and declined over time, indicating that future interventions should address stage-specific needs across the caregiving trajectory. A systematic review has the potential to be conducted given the consistency in caregiver burden and depression as outcomes., Copyright  2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Therapeutic interventions using the Internet and computer technologies could improve this situation and provide more feasible and acceptable approaches., OBJECTIVE: , The objective of the study was to show how we developed a pilot version of a new Web-based cognitive behavioral relapse prevention program with tailored feedback to assist people with drug problems and assessed its acceptance and usability., METHODS: , We developed the pilot program based on existing face-to-face relapse prevention approaches using an open source Web application to build an e-learning website, including relapse prevention sessions with videos, exercises, a diary function, and self-monitoring. When users submitted exercise answers and their diary, researchers provided them with personalized feedback comments using motivational interviewing skills. People diagnosed with drug dependence were recruited in this pilot study from a psychiatric outpatient ward and nonprofit rehabilitation facilities and usability was evaluated using Internet questionnaires. Overall, website usability was assessed by the Web Usability Scale. The adequacy of procedures in the program, ease of use, helpfulness of content, and adverse effects, for example, drug craving, mental distress, were assessed by original structured questionnaires and descriptive form questions., RESULTS: , ""In total, 10 people participated in the study and completed the baseline assessment, 60% completed all relapse prevention sessions within the expected period. The time needed to complete one session was about 60 minutes and most of the participants took 2 days to complete the session. Overall website usability was good, with reasonable scores on subscales of the Web Usability Scale. The participants felt that the relapse prevention sessions were easy to use and helpful, but that the length of the videos was too long. The participant who until recently used drugs was satisfied with the self-monitoring, but others that had already maintained abstinence for more than a year felt this activity was unhelpful and were bored tracking and recording information on daily drug use. Feedback comments from researchers enhanced participants motivation and further insight into the disease. Serious adverse effects caused by the intervention were not observed. Some possible improvements to the program were suggested."", CONCLUSIONS: , The Web-based relapse prevention program was easy to use and acceptable to drug users in this study. This program will be helpful for drug users who do not receive behavioral therapy. After the pilot program is revised, further large-scale research is needed to assess its efficacy among drug users who have recently used drugs."

We provided high-speed broadband service plans and Wi-Fi access points to 12 Internet-using Indian households in Delhi and Lucknow for three months. We sought to understand uptake, trajectories, behaviours, and developmental impact of the speed of the Internet on the daily lives of our respondents through a multi-phased study (baseline, in-situ usage, follow-up). Our findings suggest that high-speed Wi-Fi led to 2-3x increase in online activity and higher-bandwidth activities; spurred Internet skilling and instrumental uses online; shifted the time and space of device access; created social currency; and transformed the construct of Internet for the households. Ultimately, 8 out of the 12 households switched to high-speed Wi-Fi after the study concluded. We discuss considerations for policy and infrastructure deployments in introducing and onboarding new and existing users living with slow speeds to higher-quality networks."

Local Afghan researchers administered the Afghan Symptom Checklist, Afghan War Experiences Scale, a brief scale of other non-war-related traumatic experiences, two subscales of the COPE, an Avoidant Coping Scale, and a demographics questionnaire, and conducted a brief semistructured interview. Results revealed a significant contribution of war-related traumatic events (11%) to symptoms of distress and an additional contribution of nonwar-related trauma (7%) to distress (p’s ≤ .01). Emotion and social coping and avoidant coping were positively correlated with distress (r = .23, and .60, respectively) and did not moderate the relationship between war trauma and distress. Qualitative responses were also recorded regarding various coping strategies and shed light on specific ways in which participants dealt with trauma. Demographics revealed that women reported higher symptom levels than men (p < .05), and age was positively correlated with symptoms, while education showed a negative relation with symptoms (r = .46 and −.22, respectively). While traumatic events were positively associated with distress, adaptive coping strategies that mitigated this distress were not identified by the quantitative analyses. Qualitative data suggested that religious practices, staying busy, and seeking help from others were the most frequently reported coping strategies. It is important to continue to explore these factors and others that may help mitigate the impact of traumatic events in this culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

This type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. Innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. Specifically, immersive virtual reality (VR) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. In this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive VR. The results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of ones speech is feasible in immersive VR and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. We conclude with design considerations for therapeutic VR systems."""

Method: This study used a mixed-methods design. Ten individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited for a month-long trial in which they used FOCUS-Audio/Video (FOCUS–AV), a smartphone system that offers video and written intervention options. Participants completed posttrial measures and engaged in semistructured interviews. Findings: One participant dropped out. The remaining 9 participants used intervention videos successfully. Participants responded to 67% of system-delivered prompts to engage FOCUS–AV, and 52% of FOCUS–AV use was initiated by the users. On average, participants used interventions 6 days a week, 4 times daily. Participants used video functions an average of 28 times. They chose video over written interventions on 67% of the times they used on-demand functions but opted for written content 78% of the times they responded to prescheduled prompts. Clinician videos were rated as more personal, engaging, and helpful than written interventions. Video and written interventions were rated as equally usable and understandable. Written interventions were rated as more favorable in letting users proceed at their own pace. Similarly to what is seen in live therapy, the communication style and demeanor of clinicians depicted in intervention videos reportedly affected participants’ experience with treatment. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Video-based mHealth may be a feasible, usable, acceptable, and highly engaging method for flexible delivery of interventions to people with schizophrenia using mobile technology. Producing intervention videos is more time-, labor-, and cost-intensive than generating written content, but participant feedback suggests that there may be added value in this approach. Additional research will determine whether video-based mHealth interventions lead to better, faster, or more sustainable clinical gains. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

It is quite typical for owners of older dogs to reduce all activities such as walking, playing and training, since their dog may appear to no longer need them. Previous studies have shown that ageing can be slowed by mental and physical stimulation, and thus stopping these activities might actually lead to faster ageing in dogs, which can result in a reduction in the quality of life of the animal, and may even decrease the strength of the dog-owner bond. In this paper, we describe in detail a touchscreen apparatus, software and training method that we have used to facilitate dog computer interaction (DCI). We propose that DCI has the potential to improve the welfare of older dogs in particular through cognitive enrichment. We provide hypotheses for future studies to examine the possible effects of touchscreen use on physiological, behavioural and cognitive measures of dogs positive affect and well-being, and any impact on the dog-owner bond. In the future, collaborations between researchers in animal-computer interaction, dog trainers, and cognitive scientists are essential to develop the hardware and software necessary to realise the full potential of this training and enrichment tool."""

We implemented two interventions in a preventive youth health care setting. Adolescents in the E-health4Uth group received Web-based, tailored messages on their health behavior and well-being. Adolescents in the E-health4Uth and counseling group received the same tailored messages, but were subsequently referred to a school nurse for a consultation if they were at risk of mental health problems., OBJECTIVE: , This study evaluated the use and appreciation of these Web-based, tailored messages and additional consultation with a school nurse. Differences in use and appreciation according to demographics (ie, gender, level of education, and ethnicity) of the adolescents were also assessed., METHODS: , Two youth health care organizations participated in this study and conducted the interventions in 12 secondary schools. In total, 1702 adolescents participated; 533 in the E-health4Uth group, 554 in the E-health4Uth and counseling group, and 615 in the control group (ie, care as usual). Adolescents completed an evaluation questionnaire assessing the use and appreciation of the tailored messages immediately after receiving these messages and at a 4-month follow-up. After the consultation, adolescents and nurses completed an evaluation questionnaire on the use and appreciation of the consultation., RESULTS: , The majority of the adolescents (845/1034, 81.72%) indicated they had read the tailored messages. Most items on the use and appreciation of the tailored messages and the program were scored positive (overall satisfaction on a scale from 1, most-negative, to 10, most-positive: mean 6.70, SD 1.60). In general, adolescents in vocational training, girls, and adolescents of non-Dutch ethnicity, indicated they used the tailored messages more often and appreciated the content of the messages better than adolescents receiving preuniversity education, boys, and adolescents of Dutch ethnicity, respectively (all P<.05). In the E-health4Uth and counseling group, 18.6% (103/553) of the adolescents were referred to a nurse. Adolescents in vocational training and girls were more often referred to a nurse than adolescents receiving preuniversity education (P=.007) and boys (P=.03), respectively. Adolescents and nurses positively evaluated the consultation (overall satisfaction of adolescents: mean 8.07, SD 1.21). Adolescents in vocational training attended the consultation more often (P=.047) and considered the consultation a more valuable addition to the tailored messages than adolescents receiving preuniversity education (P=.034)., CONCLUSIONS: , The Web-based, tailored messages and additional consultation were used and appreciated positively by adolescents and nurses. The consultation seems a valuable addition to the tailored messages. However, the tailored messages might need further improvement since adolescents did not rate all evaluation items about these messages explicitly positive. As these interventions were already interweaved with the existing practice of the preventive youth health care, they are especially promising for future implementation., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Netherlands Trial Register Number (NTR): NTR3596; http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3596 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6LryL42zH)."

As a result, there is a growing demand for analysis of app reviews to enhance app usability, user experience, and hence improve overall app adoption. This is particularly true for apps targeting sensitive issues such as those promoting mental health. In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of 106 mental health app reviews from the App Store and Google Play. We mined and analyzed 1236 distinct reviews to identify usability issues. We classified app usability issues into six categories: bugs, poor user interface design, data loss, battery and memory usage issue, lack of guidance and explanation, and internet connectivity issue. The results could guide app designers on how to design apps especially those tailored to mental health to improve their usability."

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of disseminating a self-directed internet-based mental health intervention (MoodGYM) in senior high schools. It also sought to investigate possible effects of tailored and weekly e-mail reminders on initial uptake and adherence to the intervention., METHOD: , A baseline survey was conducted in four senior high schools in two Norwegian municipalities (n = 1337). 52.8% (707/1337) of the students consented to further participation in the trial and were randomly allocated to one of three MoodGYM intervention groups (tailored weekly e-mail reminder (n = 175), standardized weekly e-mail reminder (n = 176 ) or no e-mail reminder (n = 175)) or a waitlist control group (n = 180). We tested for effects of the intervention on depression and self-esteem using multivariate analysis of variance, effects of tailored e-mail and self-reported current need of help on initial uptake of the intervention using logistic regression and the effect of weekly e-mails on adherence using ordinal regression., RESULTS: , There was substantial non-participation from the intervention, with only 8.5% (45/527) participants logging on to MoodGYM, and few proceeding beyond the first part of the programme. No significant effect on depression or self-esteem was found among the sample as a whole or among participants with elevated depression scores at baseline. Having a higher average grade in senior high school predicted initial uptake of the intervention, but tailored e-mail and self-reported current need of help did not. Weekly e-mail prompts did not predict adherence. The main reasons for non-use reported were lack of time/forgetting about it and doubt about the usefulness of the program., CONCLUSION: , Overall, disseminating a self-directed internet-based intervention to a school population proved difficult despite steps taken to reduce barriers in terms of tailoring feedback and dispatching weekly e-mail reminders. Providing mental health interventions within the school environment is likely to ensure better uptake among senior high school students, but there is a need to effectively communicate that such programmes can be helpful., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , The trial was registered retrospectively as ACTRN12612001106820."

We conducted observations of 14 sessions of the intervention spanning 3 months along with 3 semi-structured interviews with each participant. We identified different activities that participants performed across different sessions and analysed them based upon their implications on technology. We found that all the participants welcomed video based training but they also faced several difficulties, particularly in establishing rapport with other participants, inviting equal participation, and in observing and providing feedback on parent-child interactions.

However, there is a limited understanding of which elements in an intervention contribute to effectiveness. For efficiency and effectiveness of interventions, insight is needed into the use of content and persuasive features., OBJECTIVE: , The aims of this study were (1) to illustrate how log data can be used to understand the uptake of the content of a Web-based intervention that is based on the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and (2) to discover how log data can be of value for improving the incorporation of content in Web-based interventions., METHODS: , Data from 206 participants (out of the 239) who started the first nine lessons of the Web-based intervention, Living to the Full, were used for a secondary analysis of a subset of the log data of the parent study about adherence to the intervention. The log files used in this study were per lesson: login, start mindfulness, download mindfulness, view success story, view feedback message, start multimedia, turn on text-message coach, turn off text-message coach, and view text message. Differences in usage between lessons were explored with repeated measures ANOVAs (analysis of variance). Differences between groups were explored with one-way ANOVAs. To explore the possible predictive value of the login per lesson quartiles on the outcome measures, four linear regressions were used with login quartiles as predictor and with the outcome measures (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression CES-D and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety HADS-A on post-intervention and follow-up) as dependent variables., RESULTS: , A significant decrease in logins and in the use of content and persuasive features over time was observed. The usage of features varied significantly during the treatment process. The usage of persuasive features increased during the third part of the ACT (commitment to value-based living), which might indicate that at that stage motivational support was relevant. Higher logins over time (9 weeks) corresponded with a higher usage of features (in most cases significant); when predicting depressive symptoms at post-intervention, the linear regression yielded a significant model with login quartile as a significant predictor (explained variance is 2.7%)., CONCLUSIONS: , A better integration of content and persuasive features in the design of the intervention and a better intra-usability of features within the system are needed to identify which combination of features works best for whom. Pattern recognition can be used to tailor the intervention based on usage patterns from the earlier lessons and to support the uptake of content essential for therapy. An adaptable interface for a modular composition of therapy features supposes a dynamic approach for Web-based treatment; not a predefined path for all, but a flexible way to go through all features that have to be used."

A new definition of the syndrome is based on clinical subtypes, consisting of ""frenetic"" (involved, ambitious, overloaded), ""underchallenged"" (indifferent, bored, with lack of personal development) and ""worn-out"" (neglectful, unacknowledged, with little control). The dimensions of overload, lack of development and neglect form a shortened version of this perspective. The aims of this study were to estimate and to compare the explanatory power of both typological models, short and long, with the standard measurement., METHODS: , This was a cross-sectional survey with a randomly sample of university employees (n=409).

In this demo, we present two flexible and individually adaptable picture-based word-learning mobile applications which are lightweight in terms of the technologies utilized (i.e. Swipe-N-Tag, and Snap-N-Recognize). Specifically, both applications allow the caregivers and teachers to build up the picture database based on a childs learning progress in the classroom and the items available at home (or outdoor during an activity). As such, the words acquired in the classroom could hopefully be transferable to real-life situations. The iOS version of Swipe-N-Tag (for both iPhone and iPad) is currently being alpha tested among a limited number of parents and teachers in a private autism center in the city with satisfying results."""

It is therefore critical to advance research on effective interventions to treat this vulnerable population. Because inhalant abuse is well known to compromise neuropsychological functioning, learning, and memory, it creates challenges for language-based psychotherapy. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of a new multimodal therapy—which we refer to as recorded music expressive arts (RMEA)—on symptom reduction and enhanced coping. Through a single case design (16-week ABA design: 3-week baseline, 10-week intervention, and 3-week postintervention), RMEA (involving songwriting, recording, and music production) was evaluated for effectiveness in psychotherapy with a 14-year-old White male, who was experiencing significant neuropsychological sequelae secondary to 3 months of inhalant abuse. It was hypothesized that the RMEA intervention would (a) ameliorate symptoms of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Symptom Checklist-90-R, (b) reduce psychiatric symptoms as measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-R, and (c) increase the use of adaptive coping strategies as measured by Adolescent Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced. Visual inspection of scale score trends partially supported Hypothesis 1 and more strongly supported Hypothesis 2 and 3. The results suggest that RMEA may be promising in further research with adolescent mental health, especially with those individuals who are in treatment for inhalant abuse—an often difficult-to-treat population refractory to language-based therapeutic approaches.

A primary problem with exposure-based interventions for addiction is that after learning not to use substances in the presence of addiction cues inside the clinic (i.e., extinction), stimuli in the naturalistic setting outside the clinic may continue to elicit craving, drug use, or other maladaptive conditioned responses. For exposure-based substance use interventions to be efficacious, new approaches are needed that can prevent relapse by directly generalizing learning from the therapeutic setting into naturalistic settings associated with a high risk for relapse. Basic research suggests that extinction reminders (ERs) can be paired with the context of learning new and more adaptive conditioned responses to substance abuse cues in exposure therapies for addiction. Using mobile phones and automated dialing and data collection software, ERs can be delivered in everyday high-risk settings to inhibit conditioned responses to substance-use-related stimuli. In this review, we describe how associative learning mechanisms (e.g., conditioned inhibition) can inform how ERs are conceptualized, learned, and implemented to prevent substance use when delivered via mobile phones. This approach, exposure with portable reminders of extinction, is introduced as an adjunctive intervention that uses brief automated ERs between clinic visits when individuals are in high-risk settings for drug use.

Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users.

The present study used a proactive strategy to increase reach of an Internet-delivered multi component computer tailored intervention, by embedding the intervention in an existing online health monitoring system of the Regional Public Health Services in the Netherlands., METHODS: , ""The research population consisted of Dutch adults who were invited to participate in the Adult Health Monitor (N=96,388) offered by the Regional Public Health Services. This Monitor consisted of an online or a written questionnaire. A prospective design was used to determine levels of reach, by focusing on actual participation in the lifestyle intervention. Furthermore, adequacy of reach among the target group was assessed by composing detailed profiles of intervention users. Participants characteristics, like demographics, behavioral and mental health status and quality of life, were included in the model as predictors."", RESULTS: , A total of 41,155 (43%) people participated in the Adult Health Monitor, of which 41% (n=16,940) filled out the online version.

The aim of this study was to investigate the post intervention effects of a cognitive–behavioral/mindfulness-based group sleep intervention on sleep and mental health among at-risk adolescents. Method: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted across High schools in Melbourne, Australia. One hundred forty-four adolescents (aged 12–17 years) with high levels of anxiety and sleeping difficulties, but without past or current depressive disorder, were randomized into either a sleep improvement intervention or an active control ‘study skills’ intervention. Both programs consisted of 7 90-min-long group sessions delivered over 7 weeks. One hundred twenty-three participants began the interventions (female = 60%; mean age = 14.48, SD = 0.95), with 60 in the sleep condition and 63 in the control condition. All participants were required to complete a battery of mood and sleep questionnaires, 7 days of wrist actigraphy (an objective measure of sleep), and sleep diary entry at pre- and-post intervention. Results: The sleep intervention condition was associated with significantly greater improvements in subjective sleep (global sleep quality with a medium effect size, sleep onset latency, daytime sleepiness with small effect sizes), objective sleep (sleep onset latency with a medium effect size), and anxiety (with a small effect size) compared with the control intervention condition. Conclusion: The SENSE study provides evidence that a multicomponent group sleep intervention that includes cognitive–behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies can reduce sleep initiation problems and related daytime dysfunction, along with concomitant anxiety symptoms, among at-risk adolescents.

The availability of alcohol in the United States, and the pervasive social pressure to drink, warrant treatments that support individuals outside the treatment environment and that foster coping and self-regulation in the face of these demands. Emerging digital technologies show promise for helping both to hone therapies to clients individual needs and to support clients in settings beyond the clinic. In the broader health care arena, digital health technologies (DHTs) are transforming how health professionals assess, prevent, and treat both physical and mental health problems. DHTs include assessments and interventions delivered via computer, Internet, mobile phone, and wireless or wearable device technologies. The emerging literature examining within-treatment and mobile DHTs highlights an opportunity to create personalized alcohol treatments for every person seeking care. Despite the promises DHTs may hold, however, there still are many potential risks to using them and a number of challenges regarding how to integrate them into treatment successfully. This article will review the current and potential advantages of DHTs in alcohol treatment and the technological, personal, organizational, and systemic limitations of integrating various technology-based assessment and intervention programs into care."""
42,"Christensen H, Griffiths KM.",2002,the prevention of depression using the internet.,Med J Aust,PubMed,,,,,"Efficacy trials suggest that depression is preventable in children and adults. However, current depression prevention interventions are not deliverable to the community en masse. The Internet offers an opportunity to deliver tailored prevention interventions such as those based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to a large audience, cost-effectively, while preserving intervention fidelity and anonymity. The Internet offers distinct advantages for data collection, which can be used to help refine intervention programs. There are no published randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of the Internet in delivering depression prevention programs. The feasibility and potential effectiveness of the Internet is indicated by research demonstrating the successful delivery of CBT by computer, the use of the Internet in the delivery of CBT treatment, and the effective prevention of obesity and the promotion of exercise using Internet technologies. Possible limitations to public health interventions using the Internet include selective access, the inability to promote the sites to potential users and the issue of uptake once users access the sites. Randomised controlled trials of CBT delivered by the Internet are required."

A major obstacle to the design of effective cognitive interventions has been the paucity of hypotheses bearing on mechanisms underlying transfer of cognitive training to Gf. Despite the large amounts of money and time currently being expended on cognitive training, there is little scientific agreement on how, or even whether, Gf can be heightened by such training. Method: We review the relevant strands of evidence on cognitive-training-related changes in (a) cortical mechanisms of distraction suppression, and (b) activation of the dorsal attention network (DAN). We hypothesize that training-related increases in control of attention are important for what is termed far transfer of cognitive training to untrained abilities, notably to Gf. Results: We review the evidence that distraction suppression evident in behavior, neuronal firing, scalp electroencephalography, and hemodynamic change is important for protecting target processing during perception and also for protecting targets held in working memory. Importantly, attentional control also appears to be central to performance on Gf assessments. Consistent with this evidence, forms of cognitive training that increase ability to ignore distractions (e.g., working memory training and perceptual training) not only affect the DAN but also affect transfer to Gf. Conclusions: Our hypothesis is supported by existing evidence. However, to advance the field of cognitive training, it is necessary that competing hypotheses on mechanisms of far transfer of cognitive training be advanced and empirically tested.

Literature might for example provide opportunities for reflecting on emotions, relationships, and possible future selves. We present the work of 2 clinicians who used literature in their clinical practice, an approach that in these cases became fundamental for successful treatment. In the first case, the client introduced literature as an important topic and the clinician responded to the client’s need to discuss literature. In the second case, the clinician reflected on literature she had read herself. She thus understood the client and could establish a genuine therapeutic dialogue. Both cases show how flexible incorporation of literature and other modes of artistic expression can provide an opening space for therapeutic dialogue, and opportunities for reflection. Clinical practice is however currently focused on diagnoses and structured interventions. Therefore, the possibility to approach clients in a flexible manner needs to be acknowledged and supported.

Prior studies have focused primarily on investigating its impact on patient-provider communication and on the implications for designing information interventions that prepare patients for medical procedures. Few studies have examined its impact on general consumers interactions with Web-based search engines for health information or the implications for designing more effective health information search systems."", OBJECTIVE: , This study intends to fill this gap by investigating the impact of preference for information on the search behavior of general consumers seeking health information, their perceptions of search tasks (representing information needs), and user experience with search systems., METHODS: , ""Forty general consumers who had previously searched for health information online participated in the study in our usability lab. Preference for information was measured using Millers Monitor-Blunter Style Scale (MBSS) and the Krantz Health Opinion Survey-Information Scale (KHOS-I). Each participant completed four simulated health information search tasks: two look-up (fact-finding) and two exploratory. Their behaviors while interacting with the search systems were automatically logged and ratings of their perceptions of tasks and user experience with the systems were collected using Likert-scale questionnaires."", RESULTS: , The MBSS showed low reliability with the participants (Monitoring subscale: Cronbach alpha=.53; Blunting subscale: Cronbach alpha=.35). Thus, no further analyses were performed based on the scale. KHOS-I had sufficient reliability (Cronbach alpha=.77). Participants were classified into low- and high-preference groups based on their KHOS-I scores. The high-preference group submitted significantly shorter queries when completing the look-up tasks (P=.02). The high-preference group made a significantly higher percentage of parallel movements in query reformulation than did the low-preference group (P=.04), whereas the low-preference group made a significantly higher percentage of new concept movements than the high-preference group when completing the exploratory tasks (P=.01). The high-preference group found the exploratory tasks to be significantly more difficult (P=.05) and the systems to be less useful (P=.04) than did the low-preference group., CONCLUSIONS: , ""Preference for information has an impact on the search behavior of general consumers seeking health information. Those with a high preference were more likely to use more general queries when searching for specific factual information and to develop more complex mental representations of health concerns of an exploratory nature and try different combinations of concepts to explore these concerns. High-preference users were also more demanding on the system. Health information search systems should be tailored to fit individuals information preferences."""

Method: Data were collected from 154 AN patients (M SD age = 25.69.4 years; 95.5% female; 96.8% Caucasian) at admission, discharge, and 3 months postdischarge from intensive treatment. Latent profile analysis of personality traits assessed at admission was performed to classify participants into personality subtypes, which were then used to predict outcomes at discharge and risk of readmission. Results: The best fitting model identified 3 personality subtypes (undercontrolled, overcontrolled, low psychopathology) that contributed significantly to multivariate models predicting study outcomes. Undercontrolled patients were more likely to have a poor outcome at discharge than overcontrolled (OR = 3.56, p = .01) and low psychopathology patients (OR = 11.23, p < .001). Undercontrolled patients also had a greater risk of discharge against medical advice (HR = 2.08, p = .02) and readmission than overcontrolled patients (HR = 3.76, p = .009). Binge-eating/purging versus restricting subtypes did not predict discharge against medical advice or readmission in the multivariate models.

BITs, which include a subset of mHealth and eHealth interventions, employ a broad range of technologies, such as mobile phones, the Web, and sensors, to support users in changing behaviors and cognitions related to health, mental health, and wellness. We propose a model that conceptually defines BITs, from the clinical aim to the technological delivery framework. The BIT model defines both the conceptual and technological architecture of a BIT. Conceptually, a BIT model should answer the questions why, what, how (conceptual and technical), and when. While BITs generally have a larger treatment goal, such goals generally consist of smaller intervention aims (the ""why"") such as promotion or reduction of specific behaviors, and behavior change strategies (the conceptual ""how""), such as education, goal setting, and monitoring. Behavior change strategies are instantiated with specific intervention components or ""elements"" (the ""what""). The characteristics of intervention elements may be further defined or modified (the technical ""how"") to meet the needs, capabilities, and preferences of a user. Finally, many BITs require specification of a workflow that defines when an intervention component will be delivered. The BIT model includes a technological framework (BIT-Tech) that can integrate and implement the intervention elements, characteristics, and workflow to deliver the entire BIT to users over time. This implementation may be either predefined or include adaptive systems that can tailor the intervention based on data from the user and the user\s environment. The BIT model provides a step towards formalizing the translation of developer aims into intervention components, larger treatments, and methods of delivery in a manner that supports research and communication between investigators on how to design, develop, and deploy BITs."

The paradigm is based on the idea that people interact in two ways with their environment: symbolically and physically. The main goal is to show how the paradigm can be applied in the design of interactive systems that offer an acceptable coaching process. As a proof of concept, an e-coaching system is implemented that supports an insomnia therapy on a smartphone. A human coach was replaced by a cooperative virtual coach that is able to interact with a human coachee. In the interface of the system, we distinguish between a set of personalized conversations (""Talk"") and specialized modules that form a coherent structure of input and output facilities (""Tools""). Conversations contained a minimum of variation to exclude unpredictable behavior but included the necessary mechanisms for variation to offer personalized consults and support. A variety of system and user tests was conducted to validate the use of the system. After a 6-week therapy, some users spontaneously reported the experience of building a relationship with the e-coach. It is concluded that the addition of a conversational component fills an important gap in the design of current mobile systems., Volume 21 Issue 4, August 2017\n"

Researchers also often use statistical methods that assume the outcome is normally distributed or transform the outcome as an attempt to make it more normal, both of which can be problematic. In this article, the authors describe multilevel 2-part models that use a mixture of logistic regression—to predict whether a person was active—and gamma regression—to predict amount of activity if there was activity. Method: The authors contrast the 2-part models to a linear multilevel model using data from a longitudinal study of physical activity (N = 113; 2,305 observations). The dependent variable was minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity in a day and the predictor variables were day, satisfaction, and gender. Results: The 2-part models outperform the linear model and provide researchers critical information that is conceptually relevant, such as distinguishing between predictors of whether activity occurred and of how much activity occurred. Conclusions: Two-part models represent a flexible and useful addition to the analysis repertoire of health researchers. To assist researchers in learning these methods, the online supplemental materials provide additional technical information as well as annotated computer code for estimating these models.

We examined findings from the first state-wide deployment of HBI over the course of 3 years in Missouri public universities, sponsored by the Missouri Eating Disorders Council and the Missouri Mental Health Foundation. First, the screen was completed 2,454 times, with an average of 2.5% of the undergraduate student body on each campus taking the screen. Second, ED risk level in the participating students was high-over 56% of students screened were identified as being at high risk for ED onset or having a clinical/subclinical ED. Third, uptake for the HBI online/mobile interventions ranged from 44-51%, with higher rates of uptake in the high-risk compared with low-risk group. Fourth, results showed that, for students with a clinical/subclinical ED, use of the clinical mobile application Student Bodies-Eating Disorders intervention resulted in significantly decreased restrictive eating and binge eating. Neither vomiting nor diet pill/laxative use was found to decrease, but reports of these behaviors were very low. This is the first deployment of a comprehensive online platform for screening and delivering tailored interventions to a population of individuals with varying ED risk and symptom profiles in an organized care setting.

Functional assessments such as rating scales, ABC analyses, and functional analyses, are evidenced to be the most effective methods for identifying the maintaining variables of problem behavior and for informing efficient, function-based interventions. Although the empirical literature and federal mandates support the use of functional assessment, obstacles to the practical application of these procedures in school settings (e.g., training requirements, time constraints) may deter school staff from using them consistently. Recent research has addressed some of these concerns, and there is developing evidence for briefer, more user-friendly versions of functional assessment. Practitioners can maximize the effectiveness of the intervention process by linking treatment components to functional assessment results. Effective, function-based interventions are comprised of procedures designed to reduce target behavior prior to it occurrence, procedures to teach the learner to access the reinforcer (or an adaptive alternative) appropriately, and systematic procedures for responding to the behavior. Future studies should continue to refine these procedures and address the use of functional assessment with ext ended populations, including adults with disabilities and typically developing children.

Physical mobility of devices was becoming commonplace with the availability of cheap wireless cards, the first attempts to transform phones into personal do-it-all devices were beginning to appear, and mobile ad hoc networks were attracting a huge interest from many research communities. Logical mobility of code was still going strong as a design option for distributed systems, with the Java language providing some of the ready-to-use building blocks. In 2000, when we put forth a research “roadmap” for software engineering for mobility, the challenges posed by this dynamic scenario were many. A decade and a half later, many things have changed. Mobility is no longer exotic: we juggle multiple personal devices every day while on the move, plus we grab and update applications on a whim from virtual stores. Indeed, some trends and visions we considered in our original paper materialized, while others faded, disappeared, or morphed into something else. Moreover, some players unexpected at the time (e.g., cloud computing and online social networks) appeared on the scene as game changers. In this paper we revisit critically our original vision, reflecting on the past and peering into the future of the lively and exciting research area of mobility. Further, we ask ourselves to what extent the software engineering community is still interested in taking up the challenges mobility bears. "

Treatment outcomes of a pediatric weight management program with a large and diverse baseline sample were evaluated. Demographic and socioeconomic predictors of change in zBMI after 1 year were examined separately to identify characteristics contributing to treatment outcomes. It was hypothesized that socioeconomic disparities would account for lower zBMI outcomes above and beyond demographic factors. Method: Data were collected from 1,784 youth at baseline (n = 271 at 12 months; age M = 11.89 years, SD = 3.15). Information on zBMI, demographics (sex, race, age, mother’s body mass index BMI) and socioeconomic status (SES; health insurance, number parents in home) were collected at baseline and 12 months post intervention. Results: After 1 year, average change in zBMI was −0.12 (SD = 0.21). Linear hierarchical regression analysis assessed if SES factors predicted change in zBMI after 12 months above and beyond demographic factors. Demographics were entered in Block 1, and SES factors in Block 2. The final model significantly accounted for 14.2% of variance in change in zBMI (p < .000). Examining blocks separately indicated SES variables did not significantly add to the model beyond demographic variables, contributing to less than 1.0% of the variance. Unique predictors included age, and mother’s BMI. Conclusions: Participation in the program was associated with decreases in zBMI for youth who completed the year of treatment and follow-ups. Factors related to age and family had the largest association with weight loss. SES factors were not related to change in zBMI beyond demographic factors.

An adaptive intervention is a protocolized sequence of individualized treatments that seeks to address the unique and changing needs of individuals as they progress through an intervention program. The sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental study design that can be used to build the empirical basis for the construction of effective adaptive interventions. A SMART involves multiple stages of randomizations; each stage of randomization is designed to address scientific questions concerning the best intervention option to employ at that point in the intervention. Several adaptive interventions are embedded in a SMART by design; many SMARTs are motivated by scientific questions that concern the comparison of these embedded adaptive interventions. Until recently, analysis methods available for the comparison of adaptive interventions were limited to end-of-study outcomes. The current article provides an accessible and comprehensive tutorial to a new methodology for using repeated outcome data from SMART studies to compare adaptive interventions. We discuss how existing methods for comparing adaptive interventions in terms of end-of-study outcome data from a SMART can be extended for use with longitudinal outcome data. We also highlight the scientific utility of using longitudinal data from a SMART to compare adaptive interventions.

Brief interventions (eg, single session) that are augmented by follow-on automated mobile health intervention may expand treatment access. This was a randomized single-blind controlled trial with 255 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: CBT2go, which combined one individual session of cognitive behavioral therapy with automated thought challenging/adaptive behavior delivered through mobile devices; Self-Monitoring (SM), which combined single-session illness psychoeducation with self-monitoring of symptoms; and treatment-as-usual (TAU). Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (midpoint), 12 weeks (posttreatment), and 24 weeks (follow-up) with our primary outcome global psychopathology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-expanded version BPRS-24), and secondary outcomes community functioning (Specific Level of Function; SLOF) and defeatist performance beliefs (DPBs). We also collected data on adverse events. Outcome analyses on the primary outcome, BPRS Total score, indicated a significant time (0-24 wk) by group interaction with significant but modest improvement comparing two active conditions (CBT2go and SM) relative to TAU. Effects of CBT2go were not different from SM. There was a significant time  group interaction with better SLOF scores in CBT2go across 24 weeks, but not in SM. There were no time-by-group effects on DPBs. DPBs decreased in the CBT2go condition but not in SM.

Robust research on the impact of mobile technology interventions for these patients remains scarce., OBJECTIVE: , The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of individually tailored short text messages on the rate of psychiatric hospital readmissions, health care service use, and clinical outcomes. In addition, we analyzed treatment costs., METHODS: , Between September 2011 and November 2012, we randomly assigned 1139 people to a tailored text message intervention (n=569) or usual care (n=570). Participants received semiautomated text messages for up to 12 months or usual care. The primary outcome, based on routinely collected health register data, was patient readmission into a psychiatric hospital during a 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes were related to other service use, coercion, medication, adverse events, satisfaction, social functioning, quality of life, and economic factors (cost analysis)., RESULTS: , There was 98.24% (1119/1139) follow-up at 12 months. Tailored mobile telephone text messages did not reduce the rate of hospital admissions (242/563, 43.0% of the SMS group vs 216/556, 38.8% of the control group; relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.92-1.33; P=.28), time between hospitalizations (mean difference 7.0 days 95% CI -8.0 to 24.0; P=.37), time spent in a psychiatric hospital during the year (mean difference 2.0 days 95% CI -2.0 to 7.0; P=.35), or other service outcomes. People who received text messages were less disabled, based on Global Assessment Scale scores at the time of their readmission, than those who did not receive text messages (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.47-0.97; P=.04). The costs of treatment were higher for people in the SMS group than in the control group (mean 10,103 vs 9210, respectively, P<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: , High-grade routinely collected data can provide clear outcomes for pragmatic randomized trials. SMS messaging tailored with the input of each individual patient did not decrease the rate of psychiatric hospital visits after the 12 months of follow-up.

This paper presents Sensus, a new MCS system for human-subject studies that bridges the gap between human-subject researchers and MCS methods. Sensus alleviates technical burdens with on-device, GUI-based design of sensing plans, simple and efficient distribution of sensing plans to study participants, and uniform participant experience across iOS and Android devices. Sensing plans support many hardware and software sensors, automatic deployment of sensor-triggered surveys, and double-blind assignment of participants within randomized controlled trials. Sensus offers these features to study designers without requiring knowledge of markup and programming languages. We demonstrate the feasibility of using Sensus within two human-subject studies, one in psychology and one in engineering.

Methods: A quasi-experimental, comparative research design was conducted by using data obtained from 95 adults with SMI who received public mental health services. Participants completed a sensory processing profile and measures of community participation, recovery, and quality of life. Comparisons were made between sensory profile categories for each dependent variable using multivariate analyses of variance. Results: The category with more evidence of self-reported low registration and sensory sensitivity than most reported less participation and lower levels of recovery than did their peers with processing patterns in typical ranges. The category with more self-reported sensory sensitivity than most reported lower quality of life. Finally, the category in the “similar” to “more than most” range on self-reported sensory seeking had higher levels of participation and recovery.

Although the model is non-convex and non-differentiable, we propose an effective reweighted algorithm and provide solid theoretical analyses. We prove that the proposed algorithm can sufficiently decrease the objective function value at each iteration and will converge after a finite number of iterations. Extensive experiment results on two datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve almost identical results compared with state-of-the-art contextual bandit methods on the dataset without outliers, and significantly outperform those state-of-the-art methods on the badly noised dataset with outliers in a variety of parameter settings."

Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an evidence based service-delivery model that provides comprehensive, practical, flexible, team based treatment for people with serious and persistent mental illnesses. This book is an interesting collection of chapters edited by Caroline Cupitt that describes the experiences of implementing assertive outreach in Great Britain and the value of psychological approaches within an outreach team. The authors argue that assertive outreach is a very powerful intervention, but that ACT teams often lack valuable psychotherapeutic depth. The book is divided into two sections. Part I: Taking a Psychological Approach, includes five chapters describing the authors strategies for incorporating psychological components into assertive outreach teams and two chapters on teamwork. Part II of the book includes five chapters on delivering psychological therapies within the context of assertive outreach. On balance, this book is an interesting and reasonably useful book. Like most edited volumes, some chapters are better than others and most readers will pay close attention to some parts and skim through others.

We were interested whether reduced contact with a therapist influenced treatment outcome, therapeutic alliance, parent adherence to treatment prescriptions, and parent reactions to and evaluations of the treatment procedures. Sixty children and their caregivers were assigned to receive either Full Contact PMT (with the amount of weekly contact similar to traditional PMT; approximately 50 minutes of direct therapist contact each week) or Reduced Contact PMT (with most information provided through recordings; approximately 10 minutes of therapist contact each week). Children in both groups showed significant and similar reductions in antisocial behaviors specifically, internalizing and externalizing symptoms more generally, and improvements in overall adaptive functioning. Therapeutic alliance also was similar across the two treatment groups. However, parents rated Full Contact treatment as more acceptable than the reduced version. Both treatments were similar in outcomes to in-person treatment as evaluated by a nonrandomized matched sample used as a benchmark in supplementary analyses. Overall, the findings indicate that therapist contact can be reduced while positive treatment outcomes are maintained but that interventions that reduce direct time with a therapist may be viewed less positively by clients."

The current case series describes an accelerated rapid-response behavioral triage for tics (RRBTT) and treatment outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted on clinically referred patients (n = 10). The RRBTT consisted of 8 sessions delivered over 2 weeks, with a 1-month booster and evaluation session. Primary outcome measures were completed by the therapist conjointly with the parent and child at baseline, 1 and 2 weeks after beginning treatment, and 1 month after completing treatment. On average, youth experienced significant reductions (17.9%) in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale after 1 week of treatment and (40.8%) by the 2-week posttreatment assessment (effect size = .76). Posttreatment improvements in outcomes maintained at the 1-month follow-up with no additional treatment. Half of the patients (n = 5) were rated as treatment responders, with 4 additional patients rated as receiving some benefit. The current findings highlight the flexible administration of an accelerated behavioral treatment, suggesting that the RRBTT may be effective in treating children and adolescents with tic disorders.

The use of Q is to indicate that this method is used to assess the relative quality of the intervention options. In particular, we use Q-learning with linear regression to estimate the optimal (i.e., most effective) sequence of decision rules. We illustrate how Q-learning can be used with data from sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs; Murphy, 2005) to inform the construction of a more deeply tailored sequence of decision rules than those embedded in the SMART design.

Existing technologies focus predominantly on enhancing academic abilities, such as literacy or numeracy, disregarding the potential to support personal interests and individual goals. Through a process of Reflective Agile Iterative Design (RAID), a mobile app was developed which enabled young adults with intellectual disability to produce an image of themselves achieving a certain goal. Although the app was designed for individual use in formal goal-setting meetings, participants used the app for social activities, such as taking group selfies, emailing their images to proxies and layering selfies.

Web-based decision aids are as effective as individually tailored counseling at reducing cardiovascular risk. Among health attack survivors, the ProActive Heart study involving telephone delivered counseling reduced anxiety whereas integrated motivational interviewing cognitive behavioral therapy (Beating Heart Problems) reduced depression and anger with no physiological or behavioral benefits., SUMMARY: , Psychological conditions increase cardiovascular risk as well as complicate cardiovascular disease. Psychological interventions are, however, far less studied compared with pharmacological and device therapies for cardiovascular disease. Interventions can either be delivered in isolation or in combination with other interventions including education, exercise, and medications, whereas outcomes measured could include psychometrics, behavior, risk scores, cardiovascular endpoints, and mortality. Due to the large variety of possible interventions and outcomes, published studies have reported mixed results and it remains unclear which modes of delivery and which types of intervention are most appropriate."

But how can ideators best use these examples to create new innovations? Recent work has suggested that not just the choice of examples, but also the timing of their delivery can impact creative outcomes. Building on existing cognitive theories of creative insight, we hypothesize that people are likely to benefit from examples when they run out of ideas. We explore two example delivery mechanisms that test this hypothesis: 1) a system that proactively provides examples when a user appears to have run out of ideas, and 2) a system that provides examples when a user explicitly requests them. Our online experiment (N=97) compared these two mechanisms against two baselines: providing no examples and automatically showing examples at a regular interval. Participants who requested examples themselves generated ideas that were rated the most novel by external evaluators. Participants who received ideas automatically when they appeared to be stuck produced the most ideas. Importantly, participants who received examples at a regular interval generated fewer ideas than participants who received no examples, suggesting that mere access to examples is not sufficient for creative inspiration. These results emphasize the importance of the timing of example delivery. Insights from this study can inform the design of collective ideation support systems that help people generate many high quality ideas."

Interventions in health care settings have primarily focused on screening and referral, however, women often may not disclose abuse to health practitioners. The internet offers a confidential space in which women can assess the health of their relationships and make a plan for safety and wellbeing for themselves and their children. This randomised controlled trial is testing the effectiveness of a web-based healthy relationship tool and safety decision aid (I-DECIDE). Based broadly on the IRIS trial in the United States, it has been adapted for the Australian context where it is conducted entirely online and uses the Psychosocial Readiness Model as the basis for the intervention., METHODS/DESIGN: , In this two arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, women who have experienced abuse or fear of a partner in the previous 6 months will be computer randomised to receive either the I-DECIDE website or a comparator website (basic relationship and safety advice). The intervention includes self-directed reflection exercises on their relationship, danger level, priority setting, and results in an individualised, tailored action plan. Primary self-reported outcomes are: self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale) immediately after completion, 6 and 12 months post-baseline; and depressive symptoms (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised, 6 and 12 months post-baseline). Secondary outcomes include mean number of helpful actions for safety and wellbeing, mean level of fear of partner and cost-effectiveness., DISCUSSION: , This fully-automated trial will evaluate a web-based self-information, self-reflection and self-management tool for domestic violence. We hypothesise that the improvement in self-efficacy and mental health will be mediated by increased perceived support and awareness encouraging positive change.

Cultural adaptation of evidence-based Western psychotherapy is an important step toward better prevention and treatment of depressive illness in the Arab community. Project CATCH-IT is an Internet-based depression prevention intervention tool that is tailored for adolescents and young adults. Methods The PEN-3 theoretical framework was used for the cultural adaptation of Project CATCH-IT for Arab adolescents. First, a narrative review of existing research about depression in Arab nations was performed. Next, expert opinions about applicability and societal values were obtained. This model was then used to suggest relevant changes to the CATCH-IT modules. These modifications were applied to create sample webpages from the culturally adapted version of CATCH-IT for Arab youth. Results The narrative review, expert opinions and resultant PEN-3 analysis suggest that Internet-based depression interventions are effective, private and confidential. To be most effective, religious leaders and fathers should be the stakeholders approached for dissemination and adequate usage of the service. Arab themes, quotes, language and relevant stories must be incorporated. Conclusion This study sets the background for future studies and research for implementation of the Arabic version of CATCH-IT for the prevention of depression. Using the contextual information provided in this paper to make the necessary changes, huge strides can be made in providing cost-effective and accessible Internet-based interventions to Arab youth."

At the same time, only 25% of adolescents with mental health problems receive professional treatment. One explanation for poor treatment access in youths is their low help-seeking behavior. Barriers that can keep children and adolescents (C&A) from seeking professional help include a lack of perceived need, structural barriers, or stigma. Interventions based on e-technology might present an effective approach, overcoming these barriers by reducing stigma and providing low-threshold access with enhanced reach, ultimately facilitating help-seeking for mental health problems among youths., METHODS: , The study is designed as a multi-center, randomized controlled trial. In total, an estimated number of n =1,500 C&A with mental health problems, drawn from a school-based sample of n =15,000 pupils attending school grades 6 to 13 (12years of age), recruited in five regions of Germany, will be randomized either to an intervention (ProHEAD online) or a control condition. C&A in the intervention group will receive online access to tailored information and individual advice on where to seek professional help for their specific needs close to their place of living, case reports of and interaction with peers, as well as the opportunity for online and telephone counseling. C&A in the control intervention will receive a recommendation to seek help and online information on where to find professional help. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires concerning their help-seeking behavior at baseline, during the intervention (monitoring), and also at a 1 and 2 year follow-up. The primary endpoint is the number of C&A seeking conventional face-to-face professional help in the real-world setting within 1 year after their initial screening., DISCUSSION: , The trial will investigate if an Internet-based intervention can increase professional help-seeking in C&A with mental health problems. With its randomized controlled design and large-scale school-based sampling, the study aims to overcome the shortages of previous research. The intervention has the potential to narrow the treatment gap in C&A and to ultimately improve the mental health care system., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00014685 .

Young adults experiencing mental distress and suicidal ideation are reluctant to seek help, requiring new strategies to reach this group. Aims: The present study explored young peoples views of professional care before first contact for DSH, and factors that influenced the establishing of contact. Method: Interviews with 10 young individuals, shortly after they had harmed themselves, were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The participants emphasized the importance of receiving more knowledge on where to turn, having different help-seeking options, and receiving immediate help. Family and friends were vital for support and making health care contact. The quality of the professional contact was stressed. Several reasons for not communicating distress were mentioned. Two themes were identified: A need for a more flexible, available and varied health care and A struggle to be independent and yet being in need of reliable support. Conclusion: These findings suggest that easy and direct access to professional help is a decisive factor for young people experiencing psychological problems and that health services must find new ways of communicating information on seeking mental health help.

An online self-management support intervention was therefore developed and conducted involving the following elements: (1) email contact with a specialized dementia nurse, (2) online videos, and (3) e-bulletins containing information about behavior changes and how to manage them., OBJECTIVE: , ""The aim of this study was to understand (1) family caregivers actual use of various elements of the online self-management support, (2) family caregivers evaluation and satisfaction with the various elements, and (3) nurses usage and evaluations of the online support through the tailored email contacts."", METHODS: , ""A mixed methods design was used in this process evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods including analyses of dementia nurses registration forms, the number of clicks on online videos and e-bulletins, evaluation questions answered by family caregivers in a survey questionnaire, semistructured interviews with family caregivers and nurses, and analysis of the content of the email contacts."", RESULTS: , ""The actual use of various elements of the online self-management support by family caregivers varied: 78% (21/27) of family caregivers had an email contact with the specialist nurse, 80% (43/54) of family caregivers clicked on an online video, and 37% (30/81) clicked on an e-bulletin. Family caregivers showed positive evaluations and satisfaction. The tailor-made approach in the personal email contacts in particular was valued by the family caregivers. Nurses evaluations about providing self-management support online were mixed as it was a relatively new task for them."", CONCLUSIONS: , An important insight is that not all participants made optimum use of the various elements of the intervention. Nurses also said that the email contacts were more often used to express feelings about coping with behavioral changes. More research is needed to investigate the reasons why people accept, adopt, and adhere to online interventions to reduce cases where they are not used and to back them up appropriately with tailored (online) information and advice for their personal situations., Judith G Huis in het Veld, Iris F M van Asch, Bernadette M Willemse, Paul-Jeroen Verkade, Anne Margriet Pot, Marco M Blom, Rob B M Groot Zwaaftink, Anneke L Francke.

Previous research examining the development and acceptability of online interventions has revealed that issues such as privacy critically impact user willingness to engage with these services., OBJECTIVE: , To explore university student perspectives on privacy issues related to using an online mental health service within the context of the development of an online, university-based virtual mental health clinic., METHODS: , There were two stages of data collection. The first stage consisted of four 1.5-hour focus groups conducted with university students (n=19; 10 female, 9 male, mean age = 21.6 years) to determine their ideas about the virtual clinic including privacy issues. The second stage comprised three 1-hour prototype testing sessions conducted with university students (n=6; 3 male, 3 female, mean age = 21.2 years) using participatory design methods to develop and refine a service model for the virtual clinic and determine student views on privacy within this context., RESULTS: , The students raised a number of issues related to privacy in relation to the development of the university virtual clinic. Major topics included the types of personal information they would be willing to provide (minimal information and optional mental health data), concern about potential access to their personal data by the university, the perceived stigma associated with registering for the service, and privacy and anonymity concerns related to online forums contained within the virtual clinic., CONCLUSIONS: , Students would be more comfortable providing personal information and engaging with the virtual clinic if they trust the privacy and security of the service. Implications of this study include building the clinic in a flexible way to accommodate user preferences."

This exploratory study explored mentoring relationships in the lives of 140 care leavers, and the way those relationships influenced their life course. Findings showed that most of the mentors were known to the young adults from their former care placement for 3 years and above. Thematic analysis revealed 2 main “types” of mentor: (1) a present, accessible and supportive mentor, who is mainly characterized as a parental figure and a role model, a life coach who is also a confidant; (2) a motivating and catalyzing mentor, who is characterized as promoting adaptive coping with life stressors, and leading the young adults to set and achieve their goals and change their behavioral and mental status for the better. The discussion addresses the contribution of mentoring relationships to the young adults’ resilience in reference to social support and attachment theories. It discusses the importance of promoting a “mentoring policy” within the residential care settings, to enable youth to continue their relationships with their mentors during their challenging transition to emerging adulthood.

Drawing on both relevant social theory and previous CSCW research, this paper suggests that , open-ended social awareness, "", making users aware of both others and their own decisions, may also serve as an effective central design principle for mobile health. To explore this approach, this paper presents analysis of qualitative data from two studies of such a system. Results suggest that open-endedness allowed users flexibility and freedom in defining what counts as health, and that the social aspects compounded both the positive and the occasionally negative impacts of this openness. The paper concludes with implications for the design and evaluation of research on mobile health technology, as well as suggestions for how future work can further explore the design space of mobile health beyond prescriptive persuasion."""

The Culturally Informed and Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) is a tailored/adaptive intervention that includes a flexible treatment manual and multiple treatment components. The study used an “add on” design to isolate the effects on substance abuse, behavior problems, and parenting practices attributable to the newly developed components. Twenty-eight Hispanic adolescents and their families were randomized either to the experimental treatment or to traditional family therapy (TFT) and were assessed at baseline and 8-month follow-up. Despite the small sample, results revealed statistically significant time × treatment effects on both self-reported drug use (marijuana + cocaine), F(1, 22) = 10.59, p < .01, η² = .33 and adolescent reports of parenting practices, F(1, 22) = 9.01, p < .01, η² = .29.

Parent reports of adolescent behavior problems did not show a significant time or time × treatment effect. These results show the promise of this adaptive treatment for substance abuse in Hispanic adolescents and suggest the need for a larger randomized trial to fully investigate this treatment.

It may be possible to make Internet interventions more accessible and acceptable through better understanding of community preferences for delivery of online programs., OBJECTIVE: , This study aimed to assess community preferences for components, duration, frequency, modality, and setting of Internet interventions for mental health problems., METHODS: , A community-based online sample of 438 Australian adults was recruited using social media advertising and administered an online survey on preferences for delivery of Internet interventions, along with scales assessing potential correlates of these preferences., RESULTS: , Participants reported a preference for briefer sessions, although they recognized a trade-off between duration and frequency of delivery. No clear preference for the modality of delivery emerged, although a clear majority preferred tailored programs. Participants preferred to access programs through a computer rather than a mobile device. Although most participants reported that they would seek help for a mental health problem, more participants had a preference for face-to-face sources only than online programs only. Younger, female, and more educated participants were significantly more likely to prefer Internet delivery., CONCLUSIONS: , Adults in the community have a preference for Internet interventions with short modules that are tailored to individual needs. Individuals who are reluctant to seek face-to-face help may also avoid Internet interventions, suggesting that better implementation of existing Internet programs requires increasing acceptance of Internet interventions and identifying specific subgroups who may be resistant to seeking help., Philip J Batterham, Alison L Calear.

The sample of CT responders at higher risk of relapse (N = 241) was randomized to 8 months of continuation-phase CT, double-blinded fluoxetine, or pill placebo, and followed 24 months (Jarrett & Thase, 2010). Patients with lower positive emotionality and behavioral activation at the end of acute-phase CT showed increased risk for relapse/recurrence of MDD. In addition, patients with lower positive emotionality and behavioral activation, as well as higher residual depression (including emotional, cognitive, and social facets), showed decreased probability of remission (≥6 continuous weeks of minimal or absent symptoms) after acute-phase CT. Finally, patients with greater residual depression, as well as younger age and earlier MDD onset, showed decreased probability of recovery (≥35 continuous weeks of minimal or absent symptoms) after acute-phase CT.

Thus, it is impossible for application developers to predict at design time the devices and objects users will exploit, how they will be arranged, and in which situations and for which objectives they will be used. For such reasons, it is important to make end users able to easily and autonomously personalize the behaviour of their Internet of Things applications, so that they can better comply with their specific expectations. In this paper, we present a method and a set of tools that allow end users without programming experience to customize the context-dependent behaviour of their Web applications through the specification of trigger-action rules. The environment is able to support end-user specification of more flexible behaviour than what can be done with existing commercial tools, and it also includes an underlying infrastructure able to detect the possible contextual changes in order to achieve the desired behaviour. The resulting set of tools is able to support the dynamic creation and execution of personalized application versions more suitable for users’ needs in specific contexts of use.

Method: Veteran peer specialists were trained to deliver sessions focusing on mental health and substance use recovery to veterans for an intended 1-hr weekly contact over 9 months. Trajectories of peer engagement over the study’s duration are summarized. A mixed-effects log-linear model of the rate of peer engagement is tested with three sets of covariates representing characteristics of the veterans. These sets were demographics, mental health and substance use status, and indicators of community participation and support. Results: Data indicate that veterans engaged with peers about once per month rather than the intended once per week. However, frequency of contacts varied greatly. The best predictor of engagement was time, with most contacts occurring within the first 6 months. No other veteran characteristic was a statistically significant predictor of engagement. Older veterans tended to have higher rates of engagement with peer supporters. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Planners of peer support services could consider yardsticks of monthly services up to 6 months. Peer support services need a flexible strategy with varying levels of intensity according to need. Peer support services will need to be tailored to better engage younger veterans. Future research should consider other sources of variation in engagement with peer support such as characteristics of the peer supporters and service content and setting.

Various risk and protective factors for these disorders are potentially modifiable by parents, underscoring the important role parents play in reducing the risk and impact of these disorders in their adolescent children. However, cost-effective, evidence-based interventions for parents that can be widely disseminated are lacking. In this paper, we propose a multi-level public health approach involving a Web-based parenting intervention, Partners in Parenting (PIP). We describe the components of the Web-based intervention and how each component was developed. Development of the intervention was guided by principles of the persuasive systems design model to maximize parental engagement and adherence. A consumer-engagement approach was used, including consultation with parents and adolescents about the content and presentation of the intervention. The PIP intervention can be used at varying levels of intensity to tailor to the different needs of parents across the population. Challenges and opportunities for the use of the intervention are discussed. The PIP Web-based intervention was developed to address the dearth of evidence-based resources to support parents in their important role in their adolescents mental health. The proposed public health approach utilizes this intervention at varying levels of intensity based on parents needs. Evaluation of each separate level of the model is ongoing. Further evaluation of the whole approach is required to assess the utility of the intervention as a public health approach, as well as its broader effects on adolescent functioning and socioeconomic outcomes."", Marie BH Yap, Katherine A Lawrence, Ronald M Rapee, Mairead C Cardamone-Breen, Jacqueline Green, Anthony F Jorm.

Furthermore, internet interventions and online research studies are characterised by poor adherence and high attrition rates. This study aimed to explore participant motivations for taking part in an online trial of an internet intervention and the reasons for continuing., METHODS: , Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with twenty members of the intervention arm of an internet-based randomised control trial evaluating an online cognitive behavioural tool to improve mental wellbeing. The qualitative interviews were analysed using the Framework Approach to identify themes and subthemes, through familiarization with the data, identifying a thematic framework, charting, indexing, mapping and interpreting the data., RESULTS: , A number of key themes emerged. Trusted brands were key to participants feeling secure in engaging with the trial due to the association with institutions such as the UK National Health Service and the lead University conducting the research. Participants had a number of motivations for signing up with the study; altruism, low mood and as a replacement for a physical health professional. Participants felt the need for the language used in the intervention to be tailored to them as individuals. The majority of those interviewed also described multiple benefits from the intervention, which could have been a reason for them to persist., CONCLUSION: , The nascent field of research on internet delivered healthcare needs to take account of participant views, as have been identified in this trial and future studies would benefit from applying its findings."

Program visits were unobtrusively assessed (frequency, duration, and device used for access)., RESULTS: , ""Significantly more MobileQuit participants than QuitOnline participants reported quitting smoking. Abstinence rates using intention-to-treat analysis were 20.7% (131/633) vs 11.4% (73/638) at 3 months, 24.6% (156/633) vs 19.3% (123/638) at 6 months, and 15.8% (100/633) vs 8.8% (56/638) for both 3 and 6 months. Using Complete Cases, MobileQuits advantage was significant at 3 months (45.6% 131/287 vs 28.4% 73/257) and the combined 3 and 6 months (40.5% 100/247 vs 25.9% 56/216) but not at 6 months (43.5% 156/359 vs 34.4% 123/329). Participants in both conditions reported their program was usable and helpful. MobileQuit participants visited their program 5 times more frequently than did QuitOnline participants. Consistent with the MobileQuits built-in constraint, 89.46% (8820/9859) of its visits were made on an intended mobile device, whereas 47.72% (691/1448) of visits to QuitOnline used an intended nonmobile device. Among MobileQuit participants, 76.0% (459/604) used only an intended mobile device, 23.0% (139/604) used both mobile and nonmobile devices, and 0.1% (6/604) used only a nonmobile device. Among QuitOnline participants, 31.3% (137/438) used only the intended nonmobile devices, 16.7% (73/438) used both mobile and nonmobile devices, and 52.1% (228/438) used only mobile devices (primarily smartphones)."", CONCLUSIONS: , This study provides evidence for optimizing intervention design for smartphones over a usual care internet approach in which interventions are designed primarily for use on nonmobile devices such as desktop computers, laptops. or tablets. We propose that future internet interventions should be designed for use on all of the devices (multiple screens) that users prefer. We forecast that the approach of designing internet interventions for mobile vs nonmobile devices will be replaced by internet interventions that use a single Web app designed to be responsive (adapt to different screen sizes and operating systems), share user data across devices, embody a pervasive information architecture, and complemented by text message notifications., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01952236, ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/, NCT01952236,  (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6zdSxqbf8)., Brian G Danaher, Milagra S Tyler, Ryann C Crowley, Hvar Brendryen, John R Seeley.

Internet-based mental health interventions have the potential to be more engaging and accessible to young adults compared to those delivered face-to-face. However, they are rarely inclusive of lesbian women and gay men. Thus, the current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an online mental health and wellbeing program, Out & Online (http://www.outandonline.org.au), in comparison to a wait-list control group, for reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in same-sex attracted young adults aged between 18 and 25 years., METHODS/DESIGN: , We are recruiting, through media and community organisations, 200 same-sex attracted young adults with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and mild to moderate psychological distress (Kessler-10 score between 16 to 21). Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention (the online program) or the wait-list control group based on a permuted blocked randomisation method to allow for stratification by gender. Participants in the intervention group will receive a tailored program for up to three types of mental health difficulties simultaneously. The primary outcome of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, and secondary outcomes related to psychological distress, wellbeing and health behaviour will be measured at pre-intervention (0 week), post-intervention (8 weeks) and at a 3-month follow-up (20 weeks)., DISCUSSION: , This online mental health and wellbeing program will be one of the first online interventions to be designed specifically to be relevant for same-sex attracted individuals. If the program is found to be effective it will improve access to specialist same-sex attracted-relevant mental health services for young adults and will facilitate wellbeing outcomes for these individuals. This program will also be a significant development in the delivery of tailored interventions that target multiple types of mental health conditions simultaneously., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12611000700932.

To explore the opportunities for a hospital-based peer support system, we administered a survey to 146 pediatric patients and caregivers, and conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve patients and three caregivers in a childrens hospital. Our analysis revealed that hospitalized individuals need peer support for five key purposes: (1) to ask about medical details-such as procedures, treatments, and medications; (2) to learn about healthcare providers; (3) to report and prevent medical errors; (4) to exchange emotional support; and (5) to manage their time in the hospital. In this paper, we examine these themes and describe potential barriers to using a hospital-based peer support system. We then discuss the unique opportunities and challenges that the hospital environment presents when designing for peer support in this setting."""

These findings have resulted in repeated recommendations for the implementation of longer term treatment programs. An Internet-based intervention specifically designed for young people with psychosis may provide a cost-effective alternative to prevent loss of treatment benefits from early intervention., METHODS: , Our multi-disciplinary team has developed a highly novel online intervention (HORYZONS) in regular consultation with stakeholders within a specialist early psychosis program. HORYZONS integrates: i) peer-to-peer social networking, ii) individually tailored interactive psychosocial interventions, and iii) expert interdisciplinary and peer-moderation in a coherent platform designed to improve long-term outcomes in FEP. The acceptability, safety and initial clinical benefits of HORYZONS were examined through a 1-month pilot study with 20 participants with FEP., RESULTS: , There were no dropouts during the pilot study. Seventy per cent of participants utilised the system for at least 3weeks, 95% used the social networking features, and 60% completed at least 3 therapy modules. System usage was high during the study. There were no incidents and the majority of participants reported feeling safe, empowered and more socially connected using HORYZONS. Analysis revealed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms at follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: , Our results indicate that HORYZONS is feasible, engaging and safe and may augment social connectedness and empowerment in FEP. These findings have significant implications for the enhancement of specialist FEP services. The potential of HORYZONS to improve long-term recovery is worthy of further investigation., Copyright  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Mindfulness was defined as a multifaceted construct including observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity; and measured using the recently validated, 20-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Tran, Glück, & Nader, 2013; Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006). Nonattachment was defined as a flexible, balanced way of relating to one’s experiences without clinging to or suppressing them, and measured using the 7-item Nonattachment Scale (NAS-7; Elphinstone, Sahdra, & Ciarrochi, 2015; Sahdra, Shaver, & Brown, 2015). In a large nationally representative sample of Americans (N = 7,884; 52% women; age, M = 47.9, SD = 16), nonattachment was positively related to all 5 aspects of mindfulness. Structural equation modeling showed that the 20-item FFMQ and NAS-7 showed good fit; their factor structures were invariant across genders and age groups; and NAS-7 was empirically distinguishable from the 5 mindfulness facets. Hierarchical regression models provided evidence of the incremental validity of NAS-7. Finally, mediation models showed that nonattachment substantially mediated the links between the mindfulness facets and the outcome variables of satisfaction with life and life effectiveness.

Sexual stigma has also been associated with reduced uptake of safer sex practices, such as condom use, among gay and bisexual men. Scant research has examined the relationship between sexual stigma and safer sex practices among sexual minority women (SMW), including lesbian, bisexual, and queer women., METHODS: , We explored associations between sexual stigma and safer sex practices among SMW. We also tested the interaction between sexual stigma, social support, and resilient coping in this relationship. A cross-sectional internet-based survey was administered to SMW in Toronto, Canada., RESULTS: , Among 388 participants with complete measurement data, simple linear regression indicated both perceived and enacted sexual stigma were positively associated with uptake of safer sex practices. In multivariable analyses, significant interactions were found between perceived sexual stigma and resilient coping, and between enacted sexual stigma and social support. At low levels of resilient coping, higher levels of perceived sexual stigma were associated with fewer safer sex practices, while at high levels of resilient coping the relationship was reversed. At low levels of social support, higher levels of enacted sexual stigma were associated with fewer safer sex practices, while at high levels of social support the relationship was reversed., CONCLUSIONS: , These findings document complex relationships between sexual stigma dimensions, coping, social support, and safer sex practices.

This population includes childless adults predicted to have high rates of mental illness, especially among the homeless. Given limitations in access to mental health services, it is unclear how prepared the U.S. health care system is to care for the needs of the expansion population. Method: Using enrollment and claims data from the Minnesota Department of Human Services, this study presents prevalence rates of mental illness diagnoses and measures of unstable housing in Minnesota’s childless-adult early Medicaid expansion population. Rates are compared with prior predictions of serious psychological distress and mental illness constructed from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) using χ2 and t tests. Results: Diagnoses of mental illness in Minnesota’s childless-adult early Medicaid expansion population were more than 15% higher than prevalence measures of mental illness/distress for the current Medicaid population. Diagnosis rates fell within confidence intervals of estimates of mental illness for Minnesota’s Medicaid expansion population. Almost 1 in 3 enrollees had a marker of unstable housing; of this group, half had mental illness and/or distress. Discussion: Findings support predictions of the high burden of mental illness and unstable housing among the Medicaid expansion population. Minnesota offers lessons to other regions working to care for such populations: (a) the use of flexible financing structures to build integrated care systems and (b) passage of legislation to allow data sharing among mental health, social services, and medical care.

The primary aim of this research is to examine theoretically and empirically grounded mediators of an Internet-based psychosocial intervention for women with breast cancer. Method: Women (N = 88) diagnosed with breast cancer were randomly assigned to participate in a 3-hr workshop for creation of personal websites or a waitlist control. Mediating variables and dependent variables were assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months following workshop participation. Indirect effects were tested using single and multiple mediator models. Results: Relative to control participants, women randomized to Project Connect Online (PCO) evidenced statistically significant benefit 6 months after the workshop on depressive symptoms, positive mood, and life appreciation, as well as on hypothesized mediators (i.e., coping self-confidence, loneliness, social support from friends, but not emotional processing and expression). Change over 6 months in coping self-confidence, loneliness, and social support from friends mediated the relationship between the intervention and improvement in depressive symptoms. Coping self-confidence mediated the relationship between PCO and enhanced positive mood, and social support from friends mediated the relationship between PCO and increased life appreciation. Conclusions: Findings indicate how PCO promoted adaptive change and highlighted modifiable factors, including coping self-confidence, loneliness, and social support from friends, which contributed to positive adjustment to breast cancer. Additional potential mediators and ways in which the intervention can be enhanced are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

In this article, we propose a general Multimode user-CentriC (MC, 2, "") framework that can, with simple user inputs, adjust itself to assist user operation and thus reduce the users burden at various stages. In particular, we have identified utilities that are essential at each stage and grouped them into "", modes, . In each mode, only the corresponding utilities will be loaded, and modes can be easily switched using the customized MC, 2,  sensor platform. As such, we reduce the runtime interference between various utilities and simplify their development as well as their debugging. We validated our MC, 2,  software and the sensor platform in a long-lived microclimate monitoring system deployed at a wildland heritage site, Mogao Grottoes. In our current system, 241 sensor nodes have been deployed in 57 caves, and the network has been running for over five years.

Over the past 35 years, numerous intervention studies have been conducted but have yet to be reviewed and synthesized using a quantitative approach. To fill this gap, we performed a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of burnout interventions for mental health workers. We completed a systematic literature search of burnout intervention studies that spanned more than 3 decades (1980 to 2015). Each eligible study was independently coded by 2 researchers, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model with effect sizes based on the Hedges’ g statistic. We computed an overall intervention effect size and performed moderator analyses. Twenty-seven unique samples were included in the meta-analysis, representing 1,894 mental health workers. Interventions had a small but positive effect on provider burnout (Hedges’ g = .13, p = .006). Moderator analyses suggested that person-directed interventions were more effective than organization-directed interventions at reducing emotional exhaustion (Qbetween = 6.70, p = .010) and that job training/education was the most effective organizational intervention subtype (Qbetween = 12.50, p < .001). Lower baseline burnout levels were associated with smaller intervention effects and accounted for a significant proportion of effect size variability. The field has made limited progress in ameliorating mental health provider burnout. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers implement a wider breadth of interventions that are tailored to address unique organizational and staff needs and that incorporate longer follow-up periods.

The current study examined the curvilinear association among neuroticism and sexual satisfaction in both partners of couples from a clinical population. The sample was composed of 539 treatment-seeking couples who completed measures of personality and sexual satisfaction. Results indicated that very low to low levels of self-reported neuroticism were positively associated with self-reported sexual satisfaction, whereas low to high levels were negatively associated with sexual satisfaction. Thus, both very low and high levels of neuroticism predicted poorer sexual satisfaction, whereas low to moderate levels of neuroticism predicted higher levels of sexual satisfaction. This association remained significant after controlling for the other dimensions of the five-factor model of personality. The current findings suggest that, in clinical couples, the association between neuroticism and couple outcomes may be more complex than the linear relation that has been the focus of past studies.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such an alternate package compared with existing smoking cessation services alone (current package)., METHODS: , A literature search was conducted to identify internet-based smoking cessation interventions in the Netherlands. A meta-analysis was then performed to determine the pooled effectiveness of a (web-based) computer-tailored intervention. The mean cost of implementing internet based interventions was calculated using available information, while intervention reach was sourced from an English study. We used EQUIPTMOD, a Markov-based state-transition model, to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for different time horizons to assess the value of providing internet-based interventions to complement the current package.). Deterministic sensitivity analyses tested the uncertainty around intervention costs per smoker, relative risks, and the intervention reach., RESULTS: , Internet-based interventions had an estimated pooled relative risk of 1.40; average costs per smoker of 2.71; and a reach of 0.41% of all smokers. The alternate package (i.e. provision of internet-based intervention to the current package) was dominant (cost-saving) compared with the current package alone (0.14 QALY gained per 1000 smokers; reduced health-care costs of 602.91 per 1000 smokers for the life-time horizon). The alternate package remained dominant in all sensitivity analyses., CONCLUSION: , Providing internet-based smoking cessation interventions to complement the current provision of smoking cessation services could be a cost-saving policy option in the Netherlands.,  2017 The Authors.

A combination of drug use and mental health problems makes people more likely to be arrested for criminal involvement after release compared to offenders without a mental health problem. Previous research has evaluated interventions aimed broadly at those with a drug problem but rarely with drug use and mental health problems. This systematic review considers the effectiveness of interventions for drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental health problems., METHODS: , We searched 14 electronic bibliographic databases up to May 2014 and five Internet resources. The review included randomised controlled trials designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent relapse of drug use and/or criminal activity. Data were reported on drug and crime outcomes, the identification of mental health problems, diagnoses and resource information using the Drummond checklist. The systematic review used standard methodological procedures as prescribed by the Cochrane collaboration., RESULTS: , Eight trials with 2058 participants met the inclusion criteria. These evaluated: case management (RR, 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22, 235 participants), motivational interviewing and cognitive skills, (MD-7.42, 95% CI-0.20.12 to 5.28, 162 participants) and interpersonal psychotherapy (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.5, 38 participants). None of these trials reported significant reductions in self-report drug misuse or crime. Four trials evaluating differing therapeutic community models showed reductions in re-incarceration (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.63, 139 participants) but not re-arrest (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.28, 370 participants) or self-report drug use (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01, 370 participants). Mental health problems were identified across the eight trials and 17 different diagnoses were described. Two trials reported some resource information suggesting a cost-beneficial saving when comparing therapeutic communities to a prison alternative., CONCLUSIONS: , Overall, the studies showed a high degree of variation, warranting a degree of caution in the interpretation of the magnitude of effect and direction of benefit for treatment outcomes. Specifically, tailored interventions are required to assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental health problems."

There is accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based brief health behaviour interventions. The objectiveof this study is to assess the effectiveness, patient-level cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two new online theory-based self-help interventions among adult cancer survivors in the Netherlands. One of the interventions focuses on alcohol moderation, the other on smoking cessation. Both interventions are tailored to cancer survivors., METHODS: , Effectiveness will be assessed in two separate, nearly identical 2-armed RCTs: alcohol moderation (AM RCT) and smoking cessation (SC RCT). Participants are randomly allocated to either the intervention groups or the control groups. In the intervention groups, participants have access to one of the newly developed interventions. In the control groups, participants receive an online static information brochure on alcohol (AM RCT) or smoking (SC RCT). Main study outcome parameters are the number of drinks post-randomisation (AM RCT) and tobacco abstinence (SC RCT). In addition, cost-data and possible effect moderators and mediators will be assessed. Both treatments are internet-based minimally guided self-help interventions: MyCourse - Moderate Drinking (in Dutch: MijnKoers - Minderen met Drinken) and MyCourse - Quit Smoking (MijnKoers - Stoppen met Roken). They are based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Both interventions are optimized in collaboration with the target population of cancer survivors in focus groups and interviews, and in collaboration with several experts on eHealth, smoking cessation, alcohol misuse and cancer survivorship., DISCUSSION: , The present study will add to scientific knowledge on the (cost-)effectiveness of internet-based self-help interventions to aid in smoking cessation or alcohol moderation, working mechanisms and impact on quality of life of cancer survivors. If found effective, these interventions can contribute to providing evidence-based psychosocial oncology care to a growing population of cancer survivors., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Trials are prospectively registered in The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR6011 (SC RCT), NTR6010 (AM RCT) on 1 September 2016."

As in most other mental disorders, patients with eating disorders frequently experience relapses following treatment termination. This calls for feasible maintenance strategies that can be implemented in clinical routine at reasonable cost and effort for both treatment providers and patients. This article introduces an Internet-based intervention for maintenance support of patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) and related eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS). The program comprises several online components for psychoeducation, self-help, peer support, and professional counseling. In the present pilot study, 22 women had access to the program for 4 months. The intervention proved feasible and well accepted, and participants satisfaction with the program was high. Adherence to the various program components was overall acceptable. Patterns of utilization support the assumption that patients with eating disorders have heterogeneous needs for support following treatment termination. The study confirms the potential of flexible and individually tailored Internet-based interventions for the optimization of care for these patients.

The need for support for family caregivers has been recognized for some time but is often still lacking. With an aging population, demand on health and social care services is growing, and the population is increasingly looking to the internet for information and support., OBJECTIVE: , In this review, we aimed to (1) identify the key components of existing internet-based interventions designed to support family caregivers of people with dementia, (2) develop an understanding of which components are most valued by caregivers, and (3) consider the evidence of effectiveness of internet-based interventions designed to support family caregivers of people with dementia., METHODS: , We conducted a systematic search of online databases in April 2018. We searched reference lists and tracked citations. All study designs were included. We adopted a narrative synthesis approach with thematic analysis and tabulation as tools., RESULTS: , We identified 2325 studies, of which we included 40. The interventions varied in the number and types of components, duration and dose, and outcomes used to measure effectiveness. The interventions focused on (1) contact with health or social care providers, (2) peer interaction, (3) provision of information, (4) decision support, and (5) psychological support. The overall quality of the studies was low, making interpretation and generalizability of the effectiveness findings difficult. However, most studies suggested that interventions may be beneficial to family caregiver well-being, including positive impacts on depression, anxiety, and burden. Particular benefit came from psychological support provided online, where several small randomized controlled trials suggested improvements in caregiver mental health. Provision of information online was most beneficial when tailored specifically for the individual and used as part of a multicomponent intervention. Peer support provided in online groups was appreciated by most participants and showed positive effects on stress. Finally, online contact with a professional was appreciated by caregivers, who valued easy access to personalized practical advice and emotional support, leading to a reduction in burden and strain., CONCLUSIONS: , Although mixed, the results indicate a positive response for the use of internet-based interventions by caregivers. More high-quality studies are required to identify the effectiveness of internet interventions aimed at supporting family caregivers, with particular focus on meeting the needs of caregivers during the different stages of dementia., Jenny Hopwood, Nina Walker, Lorraine McDonagh, Greta Rait, Kate Walters, Stephen Iliffe, Jamie Ross, Nathan Davies.

Although effective treatments are available, a lot of cases go untreated. Internet-based self-help is a low-threshold and flexible treatment alternative for SAD. Various studies have already shown that internet-based self-help can be effective to reduce social phobic symptoms significantly. Most of the interventions tested include therapist support, whereas the role of peer support within internet-based self-help has not yet been fully understood. There is evidence suggesting that patients mutual exchange via integrated discussion forums can increase the efficacy of internet-based treatments. This study aims at investigating the added value of therapist-guided group support on the treatment outcome of internet-based self-help for SAD."", METHODS/DESIGN: , The study is conducted as a randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 adults with a diagnosis of SAD are randomly assigned to either a waiting-list control group or one of the active conditions. The participants in the two active conditions use the same internet-based self-help program, either with individual support by a psychologist or therapist-guided group support. In the group guided condition, participants can communicate with each other via an integrated, protected discussion forum. Subjects are recruited via topic related websites and links; diagnostic status will be assessed with a telephone interview. The primary outcome variables are symptoms of SAD and diagnostic status after the intervention. Secondary endpoints are general symptomology, depression, quality of life, as well as the primary outcome variables 6 months later. Furthermore, process variables such as group processes, the change in symptoms and working alliance will be studied., DISCUSSION: , The results of this study should indicate whether group-guided support could enhance the efficacy of an internet-based self-help treatment for SAD. This novel treatment format, if shown effective, could represent a cost-effective option and could further be modified to treat other conditions, as well., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , ISRCTN75894275."

The authors present recommendations and guidelines to assist researchers in developing, testing, and disseminating Internet interventions for cancer patients and survivors, to manage and improve their mental health. Issues unique to Internet interventions-including intervention structure, customization, provider interaction, and privacy and confidentiality issues-are discussed. These guidelines are offered as a step toward establishing a set of ""best practices"" for Internet interventions in psycho-oncology and to generate further discussion regarding the goals of such interventions and their place in cancer care., CONCLUSIONS: , Internet interventions have the potential to fill an important gap in quality cancer care by augmenting limited available mental health services.

Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games., OBJECTIVE: , To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective., METHODS: , We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework., RESULTS: , A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), autonomy, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model., CONCLUSIONS: , ""This studys method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a users sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose."""

Sleep disturbances are associated with significant alterations in ones mental and physical health. Once chronic, insomnia does not remit naturally. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is well-suited to address the multifaceted contributing factors unique to caregivers sleep disturbance, yet only one intervention has tested a CBT-I informed intervention among cancer caregivers. Toward the goal of developing effective, tailored treatments for insomnia in caregivers, we address the distinct presentation of insomnia among cancer caregivers and describe key modifications to standard CBT-I that address these specific needs and enhance sensitivity and feasibility, modeled in a demonstrative case vignette.

Serious games—games that motivate behavior and retain attention in serious contexts—can change the attitudes, behaviors, and habits of players. These games for change have been shown to motivate behavior change, persuade people, and promote learning using various persuasive strategies. However, persuasive strategies that motivate one player may demotivate another. In this article, we show the importance of tailoring games for change in the context of a game designed to improve healthy eating habits. We tailored a custom-designed game by adapting only the persuasive strategies employed; the game mechanics themselves did not vary. Tailoring the game design to players’ personality type improved the effectiveness of the games in promoting positive attitudes, intention to change behavior, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, we show that the benefits of tailoring the game intervention are not explained by the improved player experience, but directly by the choice of persuasive strategy employed. Designers and researchers of games for change can use our results to improve the efficacy of their game-based interventions., Volume 24 Issue 5, November 2017\n"

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended in UK clinical guidelines for the management of depression in people with long-term conditions. Access to skilled therapists competent in managing the competing mental and physical health demands of ESKD is limited. Online CBT treatments tailored to the needs of the ESKD population offers a pragmatic solution for under-resourced services. This study examines the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial of online CBT with (intervention arm) and without (control arm) therapist support to improve psychological distress in patients undergoing haemodialysis., METHODS: , Patients will be screened for depression and anxiety while attending for their haemodialysis treatments. We aim to recruit 60 adult patients undergoing haemodialysis who meet criteria for mild to moderately severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Patients will be randomised individually (using a 1:1 computerised sequence ratio) to either online CBT with therapist telephone support (intervention arm), or online CBT with no therapist (control arm). Outcomes include feasibility and acceptability descriptive data on rates of recruitment, randomisation, retention and treatment adherence. Self-report outcomes include measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7), quality of life (Euro-QoL), service use (client service receipt inventory) and illness cognitions (brief illness perception questionnaire). A qualitative process evaluation will also be conducted. The statistician will be blinded to treatment allocation., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: , A National Health Service (NHS) research ethics committee approved the study. Data from this study will provide essential information for the design and testing of further interventions to ameliorate distress in patients undergoing dialysis. Any amendments to the protocol will be submitted to the NHS committee and study sponsor., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: , NCT023528702, ; Pre-results., Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Electronic health (eHealth) support for caregivers offers an opportunity for accessible tailored interventions. The blended care self-management program ""Partner in Balance"" (PiB) for early-stage dementia caregivers was executed in Dutch dementia care organizations. The program combines face-to-face coaching with tailored Web-based modules. Next to an evaluation of program effectiveness, an evaluation of sampling and intervention quality is essential for the generalizability and interpretation of results., OBJECTIVE: , The aim of this study was to describe the process evaluation from the perspective of both family caregivers (participants) and professionals delivering the intervention (coaches) to determine internal and external validity before the effect analysis and aid future implementation., METHODS: , Implementation, sampling, and intervention quality were evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data from logistical research data, coach questionnaires (n=13), and interviews with coaches (n=10) and participants (n=49). Goal attainment scaling was used to measure treatment-induced change. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistics and deductive content analysis., RESULTS: , The participation rate of eligible caregivers was 51.9% (80/154). Recruitment barriers were lack of computer and lack of need for support. Young age and employment were considered recruitment facilitators. All coaches attended training and supervision in blended care self-management. Deviations from the structured protocol were reported on intervention time, structure, and feedback. Coaches described an intensified relationship with the caregiver post intervention. Caregivers appreciated the tailored content and positive feedback. The blended structure increased their openness. The discussion forum was appreciated less. Overall, personal goals were attained after the program (T>50). Implementation barriers included lack of financing, time, and deviating target population., CONCLUSIONS: , Participants and coaches were satisfied with the intervention, but adapting the content to specific subgroups, for example, younger caregivers, was recommended. Implementation of the program requires more awareness of the benefits of blended care self-management programs and training in tailored self-management skills., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Dutch Trial Register (NTR): NTR4748; http://www.trialregister.nl (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6vSb2t9Mg)., Lizzy MM Boots, Marjolein E de Vugt, Claudia MJ Smeets, Gertrudis IJM Kempen, Frans RJ Verhey.

Consultation via stakeholder workshops with staff and relatives and co-facilitated by relatives in the research team will inform development of an implementation plan to address these factors, which will be evaluated and refined in the four subsequent EIP services in waves 2 and 3. Transferability of the implementation plan to non-participating services will be explored."", DISCUSSION: , Observation of implementation in a real world clinical setting, across carefully sampled services, in real time provides a unique opportunity to understand factors impacting on implementation likely to be generalizable to other web-based interventions, as well as informing further development of implementation theories. However, there are inherent challenges in investigating implementation without influencing the process under observation.

As core executive-functions (EFs)—cognitive-flexibility, inhibition, working memory—are applicable to most aspects of daily living, CCT targeting these processes would likely promote gains on trained tasks, and potentially on similar untrained tasks (near-transfer), and general cognitive performance (far-transfer). We report two meta-analyses investigating the immediate (pretest to posttest) and long-term efficacy (pretest to follow-up) of core-EF CCT in improving cognition among older adults. Sixty-four studies (encompassing 3,594 participants) included an eligible CCT intervention targeting at least 1 core-EF (e.g., working memory training). Both immediate and long-term efficacy analyses revealed significant, large training effects for trained outcomes, and significant, small training effects for near-transfer and far-transfer outcomes. When comparing the same studies, effect sizes from immediate and long-term efficacy analyses were comparable, suggesting that CCT gains were maintained over time. Further analyses of immediate efficacy revealed significant, small training effects for performance on executive functioning, fluid intelligence, memory, and visuospatial domains, but not for attention or processing speed. After adjusting for publication bias, the training effect for fluid intelligence was nonsignificant, whereas processing speed was significant. It is recommended that future studies employ adaptive multidomain training as these studies were shown to produce significant training effects at each transfer level. Overall, core-EF CCT interventions show promise in promoting immediate and long-term improvements in cognitive performance among older adults.

However, the evidence base for digital mental health interventions, including demonstration of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in real-world settings, remains inadequate. The James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for digital technology in mental health care was established to identify research priorities that reflect the perspectives and unmet needs of people with lived experience of mental health problems and use of mental health services, their carers, and health-care practitioners. 644 participants contributed 1369 separate questions, which were reduced by qualitative thematic analysis into six overarching themes. Following removal of out-of-scope questions and a comprehensive search of existing evidence, 134 questions were verified as uncertainties suitable for research. These questions were then ranked online and in workshops by 628 participants to produce a shortlist of 26. The top ten research priorities, which were identified by consensus at a stakeholder workshop, should inform research policy and funding in this field. Identified priorities primarily relate to the safety and efficacy of digital technology interventions in comparison with face-to-face interventions, evidence of population reach, mechanisms of therapeutic change, and the ways in which the effectiveness of digital interventions in combination with human support might be optimised., Copyright  2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a socio-technical framework of non-functional aspects of home-based healthcare technology we aim to integrate their context and the help they receive from informal caregivers. We interviewed 10 patients after using the system. Our results show that although the system increased patients knowledge about healthy diet, encouraged them to be more physically active, and made some patients feel more aware of their health, it did not allow for much flexibility regarding the interface and interactions with the system. As such the system exercises agency over the patient rather than empowering them. More flexibility regarding how patients can use the system could empower them to manage their condition and treatment."""

Method: Participants were 20,950 individuals (50% female; 19 to 100 years), representative of the German population, who provided 81,926 observations over 16 years. Face-to-face interviews were used to obtain demographic data, including cohabitation and marital status, height, body weight, and weight-relevant behaviors (exercise, healthy eating, and smoking). Control variables included age, notable changes in status (life events such as having children or change in employment status), perceived stress, and subjective health. Results: Cohabitation led to significant weight gain in men and women—after four years or longer, about twice the gain associated with marriage (controlling for weight-related behaviors, age, children, employment, stress, and health). BMI after separation was largely comparable to BMI before starting cohabitation; women lost some weight in the first year, men gained some weight after four or more years of separation. Divorce generally predicted weight gain. Changes in exercise, healthy eating, and smoking did not attenuate the effect of changes in relationship status on BMI. Conclusions: This is among the first longitudinal studies to directly compare the effects of key changes in relationship status on BMI. The findings extend and qualify previous results by showing that the benefits of marriage or cohabitation do not necessarily include a healthier BMI. They also suggest that relationship transitions—particularly moving in with a partner and divorce—may be important time windows for weight gain prevention.

We found that the articulation work needed for maintaining the GPS technology in “working order” was extensive and ongoing. This articulation work does not merely supplement formal procedures, a lot of it is needed to get round them, but it is also often invisible and thus its importance goes largely unrecognized.

To address problems of treatment access and adherence, innovative adaptations of current interventions are needed. This randomized control trial investigated the relative efficacy of a novel format of parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT), a treatment for young children with conduct problems. Method: Eighty-one families with 3- to 6-year-old children (71.6% boys, 85.2% White) with diagnoses of oppositional defiant or conduct disorder were randomized to individual PCIT (n = 42) or the novel format, Group PCIT. Parents completed standardized measures of children’s conduct problems, parenting stress, and social support at intake, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Therapist ratings, parent attendance, and homework completion provided measures of treatment adherence. Throughout treatment, parenting skills were assessed using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System. Results: Parents in both group and individual PCIT reported significant improvements from intake to posttreatment and follow-up in their children’s conduct problems and adaptive functioning, as well as significant decreases in parenting stress. Parents in both treatment conditions also showed significant improvements in their parenting skills. There were no interactions between time and treatment format. Contrary to expectation, parents in Group PCIT did not experience greater social support or treatment adherence. Conclusions: Group PCIT was not inferior to individual PCIT and may be a valuable format to reach more families in need of services. Future work should explore the efficiency and sustainability of Group PCIT in community settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

This article provides an overview of the family systems genetic illness (FSGI) model to address the psychosocial challenges of genomic conditions for patients and their families and to help provide a biopsychosocial framework for clinical practice and research. The author also discusses some of the data highlighting the importance of multicultural issues in genetic screening and testing and the need for further research in this area. The FSGI model clusters genomic disorders on the basis of key characteristics that define types of disorders with similar patterns of psychosocial demands over time. Key disease variables include the likelihood of developing a disorder, based on specific genetic mutations; overall clinical severity; timing of clinical onset in the life cycle; and whether effective treatment interventions exist to alter disease onset or progression. Core nonsymptomatic time phases with key developmental challenges are described pre- and posttesting, including a long-term adaptation phase. The model is designed to be flexible and responsive to future discoveries in genomic research. Examples of its utility are discussed for preventive screening, family assessment and consultation, treatment planning, and service delivery in a variety of health care settings.

The reasons are an aging population, a shrinking number of workers, health care costs increasing faster than the economy, expensive new treatment options, poor public finances, and the reducing pool of health care professionals. The problem is compounded by the fact that elderly are more often affected by chronic diseases which require ongoing, often expensive, treatment. Telehealth and telecare applications are rapidly gaining in popularity because of their promise to use existing health care resources more effectively and hence to lower costs. However, usage is limited by a design often centered around the requirements of the clinical user, healthcare provider, and the equipment vendor. Many existing systems suffer from high initial costs, cannot be extended by third parties, require extra costs to add new functionalities, and are designed to create a continuing revenue source for the vendor. Furthermore the systems are usually designed to manage diseases rather than prevent them, and do not address the social and psychological needs of the patient. In this paper we critically analyse existing consumer health informatics systems and propose a framework for overcoming the identified shortcomings. The proposed system is ubiquitous, extendable by third parties, contains social aspects, and puts the user in control. Evidence from related research suggests that the design will increase motivation and participation, encourage family and social support, and improve the recording of health parameters by reducing user resistance."

Patients had moderate to severe pain, depression, and anxiety. These patients committed to study from a group of 515 patients with chronic noncancer pain of different origins who were stable on their levels of pain, anxiety, and depression for 12 consecutive months before start of study and could not afford noninsured treatment modalities like physiotherapy, psychology, nutrition, or exercise therapy consultation., METHODS: , Patients were encouraged to visit two Internet sites (a blog and Twitter postings) for educational postings written by the author about exercise, nutrition, mindfulness meditation, disease management methods, evidence-based supplements, daily relaxation exercises, and overall self-management methods 15 minutes per day for six months. Patients were also encouraged to share their ideas and comments on a blog. Activity logs were kept by patients and reviewed by physician at follow-up visits. Compliance was encouraged via weekly email reminders and phone calls during the observation period., RESULTS: , Modest improvements were noted in pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Of the patients with moderate or severe pain before treatment, 45% reported mild levels of pain after treatment, with a reduction of severe pain from 40% before treatment to 25% after treatment (p value 0.0184)., CONCLUSION: , Self-management support interventions, such as Internet-based educational tools, can be considered to help patients manage their chronic pain, depression, and anxiety and may be helpful to improve the treatment outcome in patients who could not otherwise afford noninsured services."

One reason might be high levels of extreme responses that are positive in nature (ER-Ps) compared with those negative in nature (ER-Ns) at posttreatment. ER-Ps likely consist of both maladaptive “style” responses and adaptive “content” responses (i.e., legitimate denials of dysfunction). The composition of ER-Ps might confound measures of total extreme responding as well as conventional scores on cognitive questionnaires. In the current study, we assessed ER in a new sample by (a) disambiguating ER-Ps that reflect style from those that reflect content and (b) assessing the contribution of ER-Ps to the prediction of relapse/recurrence. Method: Responders (N = 104) to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy versus medications for moderate to severe depression had an average age of 40 years (SD = 12), and they were 58% female, 38% married/cohabitating, and 85% Caucasian. ER variables were calculated using the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS; Weissman, 1979), with ER-Ps categorized as either content or style responses. ER indices and DAS scores were used to predict symptom return over 2 years. Results: No standard extreme responding variables (e.g., an index of total extreme responding) predicted symptom return, but higher relative levels of style ER-P predicted relapse/recurrence. Total DAS scores also predicted relapse/recurrence but only when high levels of style ER-P responses were controlled. Conclusions: ER-Ps, at least on the DAS, appear to contain indicators of both adaptive and maladaptive positive responses. Future research should attend to the valence of the extreme responses as well as to the content of extreme positive responses, which may reflect either healthy or unhealthy tendencies.

How Internet-based interventions will influence these relationships for persons with long-term care needs, and the measures that can be taken to maintain and enhance working relationships through Internet, is still not well understood., OBJECTIVE: , The aim of this study was to gain insights into how service users and health providers experience their working relationships when they are offered the option of supplementing ongoing collaboration with an e-recovery portal., METHODS: , In this exploratory and descriptive study, an e-recovery portal was used by service users and their health providers in 2 mental health communities in Norway for at least 6 months and at most 12 months (2015-2016). The portal consists of secure messaging, a peer support forum, and a toolbox of resources for working with life domains including status, goals and activities, network map, crisis plan, and exercises. The portal was owned and managed by the service user while health providers could remotely access parts of the service user-generated content. The participants could use the portal in whatever way they wished, to suit their collaboration. Data from 6 focus groups, 17 individual interviews, and an interview with 1 dyad about their experiences of use of the portal over the study period were inductively coded and thematically analyzed., RESULTS: , ""The thematic analysis resulted in 2 main themes: (1) new relational avenues and (2) out of alignment, illustrated by 8 subthemes. The first main theme is about dyads who reported new and enriching ways of working together through the portal, particularly related to written communication and use of the goal module. Illustrative subthemes are ownership, common ground, goals and direction, and sense of presence and availability. The second main theme illuminates the difficulties that arose when service users and health providers expectations for portal use were not aligned, and the consequences of not addressing these difficulties. Illustrative subthemes are initiative and responsibility, waiting for the other, feeling overwhelmed, and clarifications and agreements."", CONCLUSIONS: , ""The degree to which dyads benefited from using the e-recovery portal appeared to be mainly associated with the degree to which the dyads relations were open and flexible before the portal was introduced. For those who experienced frustrations, the portal may have both exposed and added to suboptimal working relationships. Use of the goal module appeared to strengthen the person-centered nature of collaboration. A key question is how health providers balance between enabling service users greater control over their care, without relinquishing responsibility for the quality of the working relationship, also when using an e-recovery portal.

The growing use of mobile clinical tools is particularly exciting for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as technologically based interventions have been shown to be both efficacious (to target academics, adaptive behavior, disruptive behavior, etc.) and accepted in this population (Odom et al., 2015). In addition, these tools have the potential to address two significant impediments in ASD intervention, the anxiety and/or skill deficits often associated with face-to-face interactions and skill generalization outside of the therapy office (Wieckowski & White, 2017). In other words, the use of technology may serve as an important preliminary or prerequisite step for face-to-face therapeutic progress. The purpose of this paper is to present a new, interactive clinical app that explicitly utilizes an individual’s restricted interests to teach skills and improve communication. The paper will briefly review the ways in which individuals with ASD may be good candidates for technological-based interventions, explore the current role of technology in existing evidence-based therapies, and discuss the use of a new technology, Sidekicks!, that has been developed for this population. A case example will then illustrate the use of Sidekicks! and its anticipated functionality across several public service settings, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and school systems, thereby coordinating the intervention efforts of various professionals involved in the treatment of children with ASD.

The current study explored the efficacy of a brief acceptance-based skills training for coping with ICs relative to a change-based skills training, a psychoeducation-only training, or training as usual. Method: Participants were 1,524 (1,372 men) active-duty U.S. Army soldiers between 3 and 12 months’ postdeployment. Results: Soldiers who received acceptance-based training demonstrated larger reductions in distress and impairment related to ICs about deployment at 1 month follow-up and larger reductions in symptoms of PTSD and general psychopathology relative to other training conditions. In contrast, participants in the change-oriented skills training showed relatively fewer benefits than did those in the acceptance-based training. In addition, soldiers who received the psychoeducation-only training showed no benefits relative to training as usual. Conclusions: Results suggest that brief trainings focused on postdeployment ICs may have benefits for soldiers up to 1 month later and may be a useful addition to a broader postdeployment transition program. Findings also indicate that an acceptance-based training approach may be more beneficial than a change-oriented approach for helping soldiers manage ICs and that psychoeducation alone may be insufficient for helping soldiers manage these cognitions.

Identity traumas, along with preidentity and nonidentity traumas, contribute to forming cultures. On the other hand, cultures may contribute to delivering some types of culture- and social-made serious traumatic conditions that can be transferred cross-generationally, such as poverty and caste systems. Most current interventions are designed to help with single trauma and ignore the cumulative trauma dynamics as well the collective identity and culture-specific traumas. This understanding entails revising our culturally limited and single-trauma-based interventions to help clients who belong to different cultures or to minority victims of culture- and social-made traumas as well as those who are victims of cumulative traumas. Multisystemic, multimodal, multicomponent flexible and fiddle therapy models emerged as potentially more effective in the treatment of disorders resulting from cumulative and identity traumas. They are more ecologically valid and culturally competent. Specific models of multisystemic, multimodal therapies—the wraparound psychosocial rehabilitation approach, for torture survivors, and the summer day and after-school treatment, for child victims of cumulative traumas—are discussed.

This study examined the effects of two health message features, suggested susceptibility and gain–loss framing, on respondents’ selective exposure and subsequent health behavior intentions. Two personality traits, repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation, were studied as moderators of the proposed relationships. An experimental 2 (suggested susceptibility: low vs. high) × 2 (gain–loss framing: gain- vs. loss-framed message) study was conducted. Participants browsed through an online health magazine while their message choices were unobtrusively logged. A subsequent online questionnaire assessed personality dispositions and behavioral intentions. High levels of message susceptibility increased both selective exposure to health messages and respondents’ motivation to engage in adaptive health behaviors. Gain–loss framing did not affect message exposure or behavioral intentions, with one exception: Avoidance-oriented low-anxious respondents selected more loss-framed than gain-framed articles for reading. Repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation did not moderate health message effects, but partly influenced these measures directly or in combination. The number of articles to choose from was limited, and it is unclear to what extent the findings can be generalized to other, more familiar health topics. Emphasizing readers’ susceptibility to health threats appears very effective for increasing exposure to health messages and protective behavioral intentions. The effectiveness of gain–loss framing, by contrast, largely depends on moderating factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

There is evidence that these conditions can be successfully treated in the workplace, but take-up of psychological treatments among workers is low. Digital mental health interventions delivered in the workplace may be one way to address this imbalance, but although there is evidence that digital mental health is effective at treating stress, depression, and anxiety in the workplace, uptake of and engagement with these interventions remains a concern. Additionally, there is little research on the appropriateness of the workplace for delivering these interventions or on what the facilitators and barriers to engagement with digital mental health interventions in an occupational setting might be., OBJECTIVE: , The aim of this research was to get a better understanding of the facilitators and barriers to engaging with digital mental health interventions in the workplace., METHODS: , Semistructured interviews were held with 18 participants who had access to an occupational digital mental health intervention as part of a randomized controlled trial. The interviews were transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to develop an understanding of the data., RESULTS: , Digital mental health interventions were described by interviewees as convenient, flexible, and anonymous; these attributes were seen as being both facilitators and barriers to engagement in a workplace setting. Convenience and flexibility could increase the opportunities to engage with digital mental health, but in a workplace setting they could also result in difficulty in prioritizing time and ensuring a temporal and spatial separation between work and therapy. The anonymity of the Internet could encourage use, but that benefit may be lost for people who work in open-plan offices. Other facilitators to engagement included interactive and interesting content and design features such as progress trackers and reminders to log in. The main barrier to engagement was the lack of time. The perfect digital mental health intervention was described as a website that combined a short interactive course that was accessed alongside time-unlimited information and advice that was regularly updated and could be dipped in and out of. Participants also wanted access to e-coaching support., CONCLUSIONS: , Occupational digital mental health interventions may have an important role in delivering health care support to employees. Although the advantages of digital mental health interventions are clear, they do not always fully translate to interventions delivered in an occupational setting and further work is required to identify ways of minimizing potential barriers to access and engagement., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02729987; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02729987?term=NCT02729987& rank=1 (Archived at WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6wZJge9rt)., Stephany Carolan, Richard O de Visser.

We argue that these interventions should also consider the development of organizational resources that ensure both the inherent and adaptive resilience of employees. This article introduces employee resilience as behavioral capability, signaled by adaptive, learning, and network-leveraging behaviors, and it discusses ways in which supportive organizational contexts enable the development and enactment of these behaviors.

Programs using dissonance-based and cognitive behavioral approaches are most effective for the selective prevention of ED. Internet-based delivery is assumed to maximize the reach and impact of preventive efforts. However, the current evidence for Internet-based ED prevention is limited. The present trial evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two new interventions (based on dissonance theory and principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)) that are implemented as add-ons to the existing Internet-based ED prevention program ProYouth., METHODS: , The trial is one of five sub-projects of the German multicenter consortium ProHEAD. It is a three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled superiority trial. Participants will be randomized to (1) the online program ProYouth (active control condition) or (2) ProYouth plus a structured dissonance-based module or (3) ProYouth plus a CBT-based chat group intervention. As part of ProHEAD, a representative school-based sample of N=15,000 students (12years) will be screened for mental health problems.

Several studies indicate the potential of disorder-specific psychological interventions for the prevention of each of these disorders. To treat comorbidity, transdiagnostic treatment concepts seem to be a promising approach, however, evidence for transdiagnostic concepts of prevention remains inconclusive. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may be an effective means to deliver psychological interventions on a large scale for the prevention of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety. IMIs have been shown to be effective in treating CMDs, e.g. in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, there is a lack of studies examining the efficacy of interventions reducing the incidence of CMDs. Moreover, the comparative cost-effectiveness of guided versus unguided IMIs for the prevention of depression and anxiety has not been studied yet. Hence, this study aims at investigating the (cost-) effectiveness of guided and unguided internet- and mobile-based transdiagnostic individually tailored indicated prevention of depression and anxiety., Methods: , A multi-country three-armed randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare a guided and unguided intervention to treatment as usual (TAU). Both active conditions are based on the same intervention, , ICare Prevent, , and differ only with regard to guidance format. Altogether, 954 individuals with subclinical symptoms of depression (CES-D16) and anxiety (GAD-75) who do not have a full-blown disorder will be recruited in Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands, and randomized to one of three conditions (guided intervention, unguided intervention, or TAU). The TAU arm will receive access to the training after a 12-month waiting period. The primary outcome will be time to CMD onset (any depression/anxiety disorder) within a follow-up period of 12months after baseline. Secondary outcomes will include disorder-specific symptom severity (depression/anxiety) assessed by diagnostic raters blinded to intervention condition at post-intervention, self-reports, acceptability, health related quality of life, and psychosocial variables associated with developing a CMD.

This results in a significant burden on the health care system, in particular primary care, and on the workplace. Chronic pain management with cognitive-behavioral psychological treatment is effective in reducing pain intensity and interference, health-related quality of life, mood, and return to work. However, the population of individuals with chronic pain far exceeds the population of therapists that can provide this care face-to-face. The use of tailored, Web-based interventions for the management of chronic pain could address limitations to access by virtue of its unlimited scalability., OBJECTIVE: , To examine the effects of a tailored Web-based chronic pain management program on subjective pain, activity and work interference, quality of life and health, and stress., METHODS: , Eligible participants accessed the online pain management program and informed consent via participating employer or health care benefit systems; program participants who completed baseline, 1-, and 6-month assessments were included in the study. Of the 645 participants, the mean age was 56.16 years (SD 12.83), most were female (447/645, 69.3%), and white (505/641, 78.8%). Frequent pain complaints were joint (249/645, 38.6%), back (218/645, 33.8%), and osteoarthritis (174/654, 27.0%). The online pain management program used evidence-based theories of cognitive behavioral intervention, motivational enhancement, and health behavior change to address self-management, coping, medical adherence, social support, comorbidities, and productivity. The program content was individually tailored on several relevant participant variables., RESULTS: , Both pain intensity (mean 5.30, SD 2.46), and unpleasantness (mean 5.43, SD 2.52) decreased significantly from baseline to 1-month (mean 4.16, SD 2.69 and mean 4.24, 2.81, respectively) and 6-month (mean 3.78, SD 2.79 and mean 3.78, SD 2.79, respectively) assessments (P<.001). The magnitude of the 6-month effects were large. Trends for decreases in pain interference (36.8% reported moderate or enormous interference) reached significance at 6 months (28.9%, P<.001).

Adolescents in the E-health4Uth group received Web-based tailored messages focused on their health behaviors and well-being. Adolescents in the E-health4Uth and consultation group received the same tailored messages, but were subsequently referred to a school nurse for a consultation if they were at risk of mental health problems., OBJECTIVE: , This study evaluated the effect of E-health4Uth and E-health4Uth and consultation on well-being (ie, mental health status and health-related quality of life) and health behaviors (ie, alcohol and drug use, smoking, safe sex)., METHODS: , A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among third- and fourth-year secondary school students (mean age 15.9, SD 0.69). School classes (clusters) were randomly assigned to (1) E-health4Uth group, (2) E-health4Uth and consultation group, or (3) control group (ie, care as usual). Adolescents completed a questionnaire at baseline and at 4-month follow-up assessing alcohol consumption, smoking, drug use, condom use, mental health via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Youth Self Report (YSR; only measured at follow-up), and health-related quality of life. Multilevel logistic, ordinal, and linear regression analyses were used to reveal differences in health behavior and well-being between the intervention groups and the control group at follow-up. Subsequently, it was explored whether demographics moderated the effects., RESULTS: , Data from 1256 adolescents were analyzed. Compared to the control intervention, the E-health4Uth intervention, as a standalone intervention, showed minor positive results in health-related quality of life (B=2.79, 95% CI 0.72-4.87) and condom use during intercourse among adolescents of Dutch ethnicity (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.71-7.55) not replicated in the E-health4Uth and consultation group. The E-health4Uth and consultation intervention showed minor positive results in the mental health status of adolescents (SDQ: B=-0.60, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.04), but a negative effect on drug use among boys (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.96). In the subgroup of adolescents who were at risk of mental health problems at baseline (and referred for a consultation with the nurse), the E-health4Uth and consultation group showed minor to moderate positive results in mental health status (SDQ: B=-1.79, 95% CI -3.35 to -0.22; YSR: B=-9.11, 95% CI -17.52 to -0.71) and health-related quality of life (B=7.81, 95% CI 2.41-13.21) at follow-up compared to adolescents in the control group who were at risk of mental health problems at baseline., CONCLUSIONS: , Findings from this study support the use of the E-health4Uth and consultation intervention in promoting the well-being of adolescents at risk of mental health problems.

Evidence supports the effectiveness of electronic alcohol interventions for young drinkers. However, effects are typically small and studies targeting under 18-year-olds are scarce. This trial is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a single-session, brief, motivational, web-based intervention (ProWISE) plus weekly text-message-initiated individualised prompts (TIPs) in reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm among children and adolescents aged 12years. TIPs are designed to decrease risky alcohol use by reaching youth in the contexts of their everyday lives and by providing individualised feedback on drinking intentions, actual drinking and succession in achieving personal goals for low-risk drinking or abstinence., METHODS/DESIGN: , The trial is part of the multicentre consortium ProHEAD testing e-interventions for mental health problems in children and adolescents. Participants in grades 6-13 aged 12years will be recruited in schools which participate in ProHEAD (target N=15,000). Main criterion for inclusion in the ProWISE-TIP trial is a positive screening for at-risk alcohol use in the CRAFFT-d questionnaire (target n=1076). In a multicentre, four-arm, randomised controlled design the following groups will be compared: (A) web-based intervention plus TIPs for 12weeks; (B) web-based intervention plus text-message-initiated assessment of alcohol consumption for 12weeks; (C) web-based intervention only; and (D) alcohol-related psychoeducation. TIPs will be delivered shortly before and after high-risk situations for excessive alcohol use and will be tailored to age, gender, drinking motives and alcohol consumption. Study participants will be followed up at three, six and ninemonths in the ProWISE-TIP trial and at one and twoyears in the ProHEAD consortium. Primary outcome is alcohol use in the past 30days at ninemonths after enrolment.

The treatment as usual (TAU) in PC is pharmacotherapy, despite the high relapse rates it produces. Many patients would prefer psychotherapy, but specialized services are overloaded. Studies that apply Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) for the treatment of depression have obtained significant improvements. Brief low-intensity approaches delivered from PC could be a promising approach. This study aims to compare a low-intensity mindfulness intervention for the treatment of depression in PC using different intervention formats - a face-to-face MBI delivered in a group and the same MBI individually applied on the Internet - to a control group that will receive PC medical treatment as usual., METHODS: , A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in PC, with about 120 depressed patients allocated (1:1:1) to three groups: ""face-to-face MBI+TAU"", ""Internet-delivered MBI+TAU"", and ""TAU alone"". The MBI programs will be composed of four modules. The primary outcome will be depressive symptoms, measured through the Beck Depression Inventory, assessed at pre- and post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Other outcomes will be mindfulness, happiness, affectivity, quality of life, and the use of healthcare services. Intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores and routine sociodemographic analysis that could show baseline differences will be conducted. Per-protocol secondary outcome analyses will also be performed., DISCUSSION: , This is the first Spanish RCT to apply a low-intensity face-to-face MBI (plus TAU) to treat depression in PC settings compared to TAU (alone). Moreover, this study will also make it possible to evaluate the same MBI program (plus TAU), but Internet-delivered, considering their cost-effectiveness. Positive results from this RCT might have an important impact on mental health settings, helping to decrease the overload of the system and offering treatment alternatives beyond antidepressant medication through high-quality, flexible PC interventions., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Clinical Trials.gov , NCT03034343,  .

However, few studies have explored whether and how these interventions enhance recovery. This study addresses this knowledge gap by examining changes among 160 participants in the Building Recovery of Individual Dreams and Goals (BRIDGES) education program. BRIDGES is a peer-led 8-week course taught by trained instructors who publicly disclose the fact that they are in recovery from mental illness. Method: Structured interviews assessing recovery outcomes were conducted with participants in the month prior to their receipt of BRIDGES, and immediately after receipt of the intervention. Paired t-tests were conducted to examine changes in psychiatric symptoms, hopefulness, social support, self-advocacy, empowerment, adaptive coping, and recovery pre-receipt and post-receipt of BRIDGES. Results: Post-receipt of BRIDGES, participants reported significantly fewer psychiatric symptoms, decreased use of maladaptive coping behaviors, and increased feelings of hopefulness, self-advocacy, empowerment, and recovery. Conclusions: These promising early results from our ongoing study of BRIDGES suggest that peer-led education interventions are a valuable resource. Additional research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of these interventions, including potential long-term post-program participation benefits.

We examined whether dynamic conflicts and adaptation to conflicts improve following short-term psychotherapy. Twelve patients with acute recurrent major depression were randomized to receive antidepressive medications plus 20 sessions of either cognitive–behavioral or dynamic psychotherapy. The Psychodynamic Conflict Rating Scales (PCRS) assessed conflicts and adaptation to conflicts at intake and 1-year follow-up. The Hamilton and Beck Depression Scales assessed depression, and defenses were rated at intake and at 1 year. Significant change was found on measures of depression. Dynamic conflicts showed significant improvement in levels of adaptation (median/mean effect size = 1.41/.92, 95% confidence interval CI .03, 1.81). However, change in Overall Pathological Conflict scores was not significant (median/mean effect size = 1.23/.85, 95% CI −.28, 1.99), principally because 1/3 of subjects failed to progress in this time frame. At 1 year, change in Overall Pathological Conflict scores correlated with self-report (rs = −.72, 95% CI −94, .01) but not observer-rated depression. At 1 year, PCRS Conflict scores were correlated with defensive functioning (rs = .77, 95% CI −.95, −.10). Short-term psychotherapy was associated with improvement in depression and adaptation to conflict, but there was more heterogeneity in improvement in conflict pathology. The PCRS showed convergent validity with defensive functioning. Longer term therapies and follow-up may be required to develop dynamic recovery and resistance to recurrences of major depression.

The diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM by registered psychologists and psychiatrists. The clinical correlates, including the severity and presence of OCD symptoms and dimensions were assessed using psychometrically sound measures., RESULTS: , 75 (7.5%) participants met criteria for comorbid CBD. The results of binary logistic regression found that women were more likely to present with comorbid CBD, whereas being a student was a protective factor. The presence of hoarding dimension, poorer insight, social phobia, binge eating disorder, internet use disorder and kleptomania were significantly associated with comorbid CBD., CONCLUSION: , The results suggest that individuals with a dual diagnosis of OCD and CBD may represent a unique clinical population that warrants tailored interventions.

We argue that in working remotely, closely coupled work tasks encourage remote workers to spend the extra effort required in articulation of work to make the collaboration function.

Interventions to improve MHL have used traditional media (eg, community talks, print media) and new platforms (eg, the Internet). Evaluations of interventions using conventional media show improvements in MHL improve community recognition of mental illness as well as knowledge, attitude, and intended behaviors toward people having mental illness. However, the potential of new media, such as the Internet, to enhance MHL has yet to be systematically evaluated., OBJECTIVE: , Study aims were twofold: (1) To systematically appraise the efficacy of Web-based interventions in improving MHL. (2) To establish if increases in MHL translated into improvement in individual health seeking and health outcomes as well as reductions in stigma toward people with mental illness., METHODS: , We conducted a systematic search and appraisal of all original research published between 2000 and 2015 that evaluated Web-based interventions to improve MHL. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to report findings., RESULTS: , Fourteen studies were included: 10 randomized controlled trials and 4 quasi-experimental studies. Seven studies were conducted in Australia. A variety of Web-based interventions were identified ranging from linear, static websites to highly interactive interventions such as social media games. Some Web-based interventions were specifically designed for people living with mental illness whereas others were applicable to the general population. Interventions were more likely to be successful if they included ""active ingredients"" such as a structured program, were tailored to specific populations, delivered evidenced-based content, and promoted interactivity and experiential learning., CONCLUSIONS: , Web-based interventions targeting MHL are more likely to be successful if they include active ingredients. Improvements in MHL see concomitant improvements in health outcomes, especially for individuals with mild to moderate depression. The most promising interventions suited to this cohort appear to be MoodGYM and BluePages, 2 interventions from Australia. However, the relationship between MHL and formal and informal help seeking is less clear; self-stigma appears to be an important mediator with results showing that despite improvements in MHL and community attitudes to mental illness, individuals with mental illness still seek help at relatively low rates. Overall, the Internet is a viable method to improve MHL. Future studies could explore how new technology interfaces (eg, mobile phones vs computers) can help improve MHL, mental health outcomes, and reduce stigma."

Such findings raise questions regarding the mediating biological mechanisms that might account for this link. The present study investigated elevated systemic inflammation, a factor shown to be a strong predictor of chronic illness and mortality in all ethnic populations, as a possible factor. Using 7 waves of data from the Family and Community Health Study, collected over a 20-year period from over 400 Black Americans, we investigated the extent to which exposure to discrimination and segregation at various points in the life course predicted adult inflammation at age 28. Our analyses examined whether cumulative stress, stress generation, or predictive adaptive response (PAR) models best accounted for any associations that existed between these race-related stressors and adult inflammation. At every wave of data collection, assessments of discrimination and segregation were related to adult inflammation. However, multivariate analyses using structure equation modeling indicated that the PAR model best explained the effect of these race-related stressors on inflammation. Exposure to discrimination and segregation during the juvenile years predicted adult inflammation and amplified the inflammatory effect of adult exposure to these race-related stressors. These effects were considerably more robust than that of traditional health risk factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and low SES. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the limitations of the widely accepted risk factor approach to increasing the health of Black Americans.

The potential for interactive electronic resources (e-resources) to support child-dietitian communication has yet to be explored. Towards developing such a tool, the present study aimed to understand dietetic attitudes and approaches to communicating with preadolescent overweight children in individual consultations to support behaviour change., METHODS: , A purposive sample of 18 dietitians, providing weight management advice to overweight 7-11-year-old children, took part in the study. Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Data were transcribed and then analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Content analysis was used to interpret dietetic attitude towards e-resources., RESULTS: , ""Six overarching themes were identified describing dietitians views: the complexity of treating childhood obesity, the strategic balance of dietetic communication focus between child and parent, the childs capacity to communicate affecting their contribution, dietetic approaches to verbal child communication and the features of resources that can support them, as well as dietetic expectations for resources. Independent inter-rater agreement for the themes was 76.9% and 73.1%, respectively. The majority of dietitians (n=13) supported the concept of introducing an interactive multimedia e-resource into child weight management consultations."", CONCLUSIONS: , Most dietitians sought to engage the preadolescent child in the consultation, using dietetic visual aids to complement verbal strategies and to serve as scaffolding for the conversation.

Improving unguided Internet interventions for mental health requires a renewed focus on the proposed underlying mechanisms of symptom improvement and the involvement of target users from the outset., OBJECTIVE: , The aim of our study was to develop an unguided e-mental health intervention for distress in primary care patients, drawing on meta-theory of psychotherapeutic change and utilizing the person-based approach (PBA) to guide iterative qualitative piloting with patients., METHODS: , Common factors meta-theory informed the selection and structure of therapeutic content, enabling flexibility whilst retaining the proposed necessary ingredients for effectiveness. A logic model was designed outlining intervention components and proposed mechanisms underlying improvement. The PBA provided a framework for systematically incorporating target-user perspective into the intervention development. Primary care patients (N=20) who had consulted with emotional distress in the last 12 months took part in exploratory qualitative interviews, and a subsample (n=13) undertook think-aloud interviews with a prototype of the intervention., RESULTS: , A flexible intervention was developed, to be used as and when patients need, diverting from a more traditional, linear approach. Based on the in-depth qualitative findings, disorder terms such as ""depression"" were avoided, and discussions of psychological symptoms were placed in the context of stressful life events. Think-aloud interviews showed that patients were positive about the design and structure of the intervention. On the basis of patient feedback, modifications were made to increase immediate access to all therapeutic techniques., CONCLUSIONS: , Detailing theoretical assumptions underlying Internet interventions for mental health, and integrating this approach with systematic in-depth qualitative research with target patients is important. These strategies may provide novel ways for addressing the challenges of unguided delivery. The resulting intervention, Healthy Paths, will be evaluated in primary care-based randomized controlled trials, and deployed as a massive open online intervention (MOOI)., Adam WA Geraghty, Ricardo F Muoz, Lucy Yardley, Jennifer Mc Sharry, Paul Little, Michael Moore.

Despite policy guidance and governmental support to develop usable mental health services, there is still a lack of easily accessible and modern interventions available for adolescents in Finlands majority official language."", OBJECTIVE: , Our objective was to develop a user-friendly and feasible Internet-based support system for adolescents with depression., METHODS: , The Internet-based support system for adolescents with depression was developed. To create this new intervention, some examples of existing interventions were studied, the theoretical basis for the intervention was described, and the health needs of adolescents identified. As an outcome of the process, the results were combined and the content and delivery of a new intervention will be described here., RESULTS: , ""Six individual weekly Internet-based support sessions were delivered by a tutor over a 6-week period of time and developed to form an intervention called Depis.Net. This was an Internet-based support system for adolescents with depression tailored to improve self-management skills and increase awareness of their own well-being and mental health. The intervention was accessible via an electronic platform, which was secured and password protected for users. The intervention on the Depis.Net website consisted of elements identifying adolescents needs, and offering self-monitoring, access to health information and self-reflective written exercises. An educated nurse tutor gave written feedback to each adolescent via the electronic platform."", CONCLUSIONS: , An Internet-based support system for adolescents with depression was developed using a systematic approach with four steps. This was done to ensure that the intervention had a sound theoretical background and at the same time caters flexibly for the problems that adolescents commonly face in their daily lives. Its potential for adolescents visiting outpatient clinics will be evaluated in the next phase by means of a randomized controlled trial."

Method: Data came from the psychotherapy arms of a randomized clinical trial for chronic depression. Participants (n = 352; 65.6% female; 92.3% White; mean age = 44.3 years) received 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) or CBASP plus an antidepressant medication. In half of the sample, receiver operating curve analyses were used to identify efficient percentage of symptom reduction cut points on the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms–Self-Report (IDS–SR) for predicting end-of-treatment nonremission based on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Cohen’s kappa for identified cut points were calculated using the remaining half of the sample. Results: Percentage of IDS–SR symptom reduction at Weeks 6 and 8 predicted end-of-treatment HRSD remission status in both the combined treatment (Week 6 cut point = 50.0%, Cohen’s κ = .42; Week 8 cut point = 54.3%, Cohen’s κ = .45) and psychotherapy only (Week 6 cut point = 60.7%, Cohen’s κ = .41; Week 8 cut point = 48.7%, Cohen’s κ = .49). Status at Week 8 was more reliable for identifying nonremitters in psychotherapy-only treatment. Conclusions: Those with chronic depression who will not remit in structured, time-limited psychotherapy for depression, either with therapy alone or in combination with antidepressant medication, are identifiable prior to end of treatment. Findings provide an operationalized strategy for designing adaptive psychotherapy interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

It comprises of two components: Imaginal Prefiguration and the Verbal Perseveration. DT has been found to be positively associated with alcohol use, gambling, nicotine use, and problematic Internet use. Despite this, neither qualitative nor quantitative reviews have been undertaken to critically summarize findings about the association between DT and addictive behaviours. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the strength of the association between DT and addictive behaviours., METHOD: , In accordance to PRISMA criteria, a research was conducted on PubMed and PsycInfo. A manual search of reference lists was also run. Search terms were: ""addiction / gambling / alcohol / tobacco / nicotine / drug / cocaine / marijuana / cannabis / opioid / heroin / methadone / internet"" AND ""Desire Thinking""., RESULTS: , Ten studies were included. Both components of DT were found to be associated with addictive behaviours (alcohol use, nicotine use, gambling, problematic Internet use) in both clinical and community samples. The strength of the association between Verbal Perseveration and addictive behaviours appears to be stronger for alcohol and nicotine use than Internet use. The association between DT and addictive behaviours is not moderated by age., CONCLUSION: , DT is present across different addictive behaviours. The assessment of DT and tailored interventions aimed to reduce the propensity to engage in DT should be considered in the treatment of addictive behaviours., Copyright  2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We see the development of effective engagement strategies as the next frontier in online health interventions, an area where much creative research has begun. We also argue that for engagement strategies to accomplish their purpose with novel targeted populations, they need to be tailored to such populations (ie, content is designed with the target population in mind). User-centered design frameworks provide a theoretical foundation for increasing user engagement and uptake by including users in development. However, deciding how to implement this approach to engage users in mental health intervention development is challenging., OBJECTIVE: , The aim of this study was to get user input and feedback on acceptability of messaging content intended to engage suicidal individuals., METHODS: , In March 2013, clinic intake staff distributed flyers announcing the study, ""Your Feedback Counts"" to potential participants (individuals waiting to be seen for a mental health appointment) together with the Patient Health Questionnaire. The flyer explained that a score of two or three (""more than half the days"" or ""nearly every day"" respectively) on the suicide ideation question made them eligible to provide feedback on components of a suicide prevention intervention under development. The patient could access an anonymous online survey by following a link. After providing consent online, participants completed the anonymous survey., RESULTS: , Thirty-four individuals provided data on past demographic information. Participants reported that they would be most drawn to an intervention where they knew that they were cared about, that was personalized, that others like them had found it helpful, and that included examples with real people. Participants preferred email invitations with subject lines expressing concern and availability of extra resources. Participants also provided feedback about a media prototype including a brand design and advertisement video for introducing the intervention., CONCLUSIONS: , This paper provides one model (including development of an engagement survey, audience for an engagement survey, methods for presenting results of an engagement survey) for including target users in the development of uptake strategies for online mental health interventions."

This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of the first web-based computer tailored intervention aimed at the prevention of binge drinking in Spanish adolescents., METHODS: , The Alerta Alcohol program is based on the I-Change Model. First, feedback from focus and Delphi groups are used for cultural adaptation and to obtain further information on the items to be included on the program. A pilot study is then conducted to assess feasibility and to identify strengths and weaknesses. Second, a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial is conducted to test the effectiveness of Alerta Alcohol in students aged 16 to 18years. The study is performed in 16 high schools from Andalusia (southern Spain), which are randomized either to the experimental or the control condition (EC and CC). The EC receives the Alerta Alcohol intervention, which consists of four sessions at school (baseline questionnaire, two sessions in three scenarios: at home, celebrations, and public places, and a final evaluation). The adolescents are provided with answers related to their views of each scenario; this information is used to provide highly specific feedback regarding their knowledge, risk perception, self-esteem, attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy. In addition, two booster sessions are given at home to reinforce the previous messages. The CC just completes the baseline and the final evaluation questionnaires and then they are allowed to receive the intervention as well (as a waiting list). Evaluation takes place after four months. The primary endpoint is binge drinking within 30days prior to the evaluation and alcohol use in the previous week. It is expected that Alerta Alcohol reduce the prevalence of binge drinking by 10%. Follow up analyses are carried out to determine the differences in effectiveness according to the compliance of the program (quality of the implementation)., DISCUSSION: , The results are expected to be applicable and may incorporate improvements in the practice of the Healthcare and Education Systems.

How these personality factors change with treatment for depression and how they relate to symptom change across different types of treatment require further research. In addition, cultural differences that interact with the dependency/self-criticism–depression relation remain underinvestigated. We randomly assigned 149 adults with major depression to receive active medication (MED; n = 50), supportive–expressive therapy (SET; n = 49), or placebo pill (PBO; n = 50). Participants completed the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ; Blatt, D’Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976) before and after treatment and completed the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1967) throughout the course of treatment. Self-criticism as measured on the DEQ decreased with treatment similarly across conditions. DEQ Dependency decreased in MED but remained unchanged in SET and PBO. Higher initial dependency, but not higher initial self-criticism, predicted poor treatment response across conditions. Greater reduction in self-criticism was associated with greater reduction in depressive symptoms, but the effect was weaker for racial minorities (vs. White). Increase in connectedness, an adaptive form of dependency, was associated with symptom improvement in SET but not MED. Hence, different pathways of change seem to be implicated in the treatment of depression depending on culture and type of intervention. Implications for future research are discussed.

The main purpose of this paper is to revise actual and new emerging ICTs and the use of its application tools in Education which is dominated by the linear paradigm in interaction and information as interactivity is not being accepted as a guiding principle. The concept of e-learning rests on the idea that pedagogy technologically sustained includes enough knowledge with regard to the wishes of learning processes, which are a process of mind embedded in a culture and also challenges and not just concepts. Learning is a process that humans have been trying to master for many centuries. However, there are so many different ways to do the process that it is sometimes very hard to determine which one is the best of a given situation. One such type of learning is heuristic learning. Through this method the students should discover things for themselves, through problem solving, inductive reasoning, or simply by trial and error. Discovering things by yourself, knowing from experience rather than books. In many situations it seems that heuristic learning is the most suitable when one really believes in something when one experiences it himself. That is what heuristic learning is really all about. This type of learning model, in an online format, is tailored to the adult learner who typically has a sense of self-direction related to individual interests, goals, strengths, and previous experience. Also the pedagogical theory of connectivism was born as a response to very fast ICT development which strongly influences education and which approach to problem solving is based on the use of simulation animations, making students change parameters and verify or seek the problem solving, applying their need of intuitive searching by the heuristic method; information is assigned by image without the application of long texts. After a series of simulation experiments, the students verify their results with a calculation and a real experiment., Volume 45 Issue 3, September 2015\n"

Participants who received psychotherapy only (PT) scored higher on a measure of PTSD symptoms than NT participants. PT participants scored higher on an emotional stability measure and lower on measures of PTSD symptoms and stigma than PP participants. Multinomial logistic regression including all variables significantly related to treatment utilization indicated that PTSD symptoms and adaptive beliefs about psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy were higher in the PT and PP groups than in the NT group, and concerns about discrimination were higher in the PP group than the NT group. Interventions targeting beliefs about mental health care could increase mental health treatment utilization among OEF/OIF/OND veterans.

Although reasons underpinning this risk are multifaceted, poor help-seeking and stigma are represent major contributors. Males in the construction industry are also exposed to other risk factors for mental ill health and suicide, including unemployment. Sigma-reducing interventions that are accessible and attractive to recently unemployed males in the construction industry could therefore improve help-seeking, and address depression and suicidal behaviour in this population., METHODS/DESIGN: , Contact&Connect will use a parallel individual randomized design to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimedia-based intervention aimed at reducing stigma. The intervention consists of a package of 12 brief contact interventions (BCIs) delivered over a six month period. BCIs will direct participants to informational programs and microsites. Content will address three major themes: debunking depression myths and stereotypes, normalisation, and empowerment. Target enrollment is 630 (315 in each arm), each to be followed for 12 months. Eligible participants will be males, between 30 and 64 years, unemployed at the time of recruitment, registered with Incolink (a social welfare trustee company for unemployed members of the construction industry), and own a smart phone with enabled internet connectivity., DISCUSSION: , At present, there are no programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing stigma in the blue-collar male population. Contact&Connect promises to provide a tailored, efficient, and scalable approach to reducing stigma, depressive symptoms and suicidality among unemployed males., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ACTRN12615000792527 (date of registration: 30 July, 2015)."

Method: Secondary analyses from a multisite study of IMR were conducted. Self-report data from consumer participants of the parent study (n = 236) were analyzed for the current study. Consumers completed prepost surveys assessing illness management, coping, goal-related hope, social support, medication adherence, and working alliance. Correlations and multiple regression analyses were run to identify self-report variables that predicted level of treatment response to IMR. Results: Analyses revealed that goal-related hope significantly predicted level of improved illness self-management, F(1, 164) = 10.93, p < .001, R2 = .248, R2 change = .05. Additionally, we found that higher levels of maladaptive coping at baseline were predictive of higher levels of adaptive coping at follow-up, F(2, 180) = 5.29, p < .02, R2 = .38, R2 change = .02. Evidence did not support additional predictors. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Previously, consumer-level predictors of level of treatment response have not been explored for IMR. Although 2 significant predictors were identified, study findings suggest more work is needed. Future research is needed to identify additional consumer-level factors predictive of IMR treatment response in order to identify who would benefit most from this treatment program.

Both the video and animation were compared in a usability trial using 37 students studying pharmacy. These students were divided into two groups, each experiencing either the video or animation sequence before being asked to provide subjective feedback of the usefulness of the approach for teaching communication. Both the video and animation group provided equivalent positive feedback about the approach. The two groups then experienced the alternative representation, either video or animation and were asked to nominate a preference.

Clinical reflections are organized thematically, with studies grouped based on (a) unique settings for clinical care, (b) innovative methods for clinical care, (c) advanced assessments for monitoring clinical care, and (d) co-occurring conditions to address when providing clinical care. Key Points: Unique settings for clinical service delivery, including hospitals and schools, provide opportunities for multicomponent and multidisciplinary treatment of violence-involved individuals. Innovative methods for clinical care incorporate technological advances and pharmacology to move beyond traditional service delivery techniques. Advanced assessments for clinical work consider not just psychopathology, but also adaptive functioning and cognitive sequelae when conceptualizing individuals involved in violence. HIV is one of many conditions that commonly co-occur with violence; ways to incorporate sexual risk into violence treatment and vice versa are addressed. Implications: Clinicians can consider this summary of clinical takeaway points as a practical resource for treating violence-involved populations.

Recent findings support this theory and demonstrate that chronically depressed patients’ interpersonal impacts on their therapist become more adaptive (i.e., less hostile and submissive, and more friendly and assertive) during a targeted chronic depression treatment: cognitive–behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP). In this study, the authors examined whether such changes in interpersonal impacts (as rated by clinicians’ experiences of interacting with their patients) mediated the association between early patient-rated alliance quality and final session depression. Method: Data derived from a large trial for chronic depression that compared the efficacy of CBASP, nefazodone, and their combination. The current subsample (N = 220) included patients in the CBASP and combined conditions who completed at least 1 depression assessment and the alliance measure, and whose therapists completed at least 1 interpersonal impacts assessment. Mediation models were fit using a bootstrapping procedure for assessing indirect effects. Results: As hypothesized, results supported a mediating effect; higher early alliance predicted decreases in patient hostile-submissiveness during therapy, which in turn related to lower final session depression (indirect effect B = −.02, 95% confidence interval: −.07, −.001). This indirect effect accounted for 13% of the total effect of alliance on depression. There was no moderating effect of treatment condition on the indirect effect.

Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral and interpersonal therapies, can have enduring effects that reduce subsequent risk in ways that drugs cannot. Although most family physicians do not provide formal psychosocial interventions for depression, brief interventions and behavioral intervention technologies, such as those that deliver care via the Internet or mobile device, are key means of increasing access to psychotherapy. For children and adolescents with mild, uncomplicated depression, physician-provided social support, encouragement, and reinforcement of adaptive behavior patterns can be as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, a primary care physicians involvement in parent education and safety planning for suicide prevention holds promise for risk reduction.

We found that participants think of themselves as being in a separate ""Rare World"" from the ""normal"" people in their lives and that relationships with friends and family members are strained. On the other hand, online communities were described as valuable sources of many forms of support, but do not adequately compensate for the lack of , tangible,  support in offline relationships.

Interact.,ACM,"caregiver, chronic illness, parent, pediatric patients, responsibility",3.0,CSCW,10.1145/3359255,"""In pediatric chronic care, the treatment process affects not just the childs physical health, but his or her psychosocial and emotional development. As a result, caring for pediatric patients with a chronic illness such as cancer is becoming a daunting task for parental caregivers. They are expected to fulfill the caregiving needs of managing the childs health condition and treatment while also meeting the parenting needs of translating knowledge, communicating about the illness, and making numerous decisions on a daily basis for their sick child due to the childs young age. Drawing on 15 semi-structured interviews, we examined parental caregivers perspectives on raising a child while also managing the childs health. We identified three tensions that participants encountered as they balanced parenting and caregiving responsibilities: (i) tension between ensuring the childs health and safety and attending to the childs social development, (ii) tension between disclosing health-related information and minimizing the psychological burden on the child, and (iii) tension between rewarding the childs cooperation in treatment and maintaining discipline. Together, these tensions reveal an ongoing process through which caregivers assess and interpret their actions and responsibilities relative to anticipated consequences across multiple time scales. These findings reveal opportunities for sociotechnical systems to account for and support this active process of iterative cycles of assessment."", Volume 3 Issue CSCW, November 2019\n"

If we are to evaluate mobile health (mHealth) apps and advance scientific understanding, we also need tools to help us understand in what ways mHealth interventions are effective or not. The concept of therapeutic alliance, a measure of the quality of the relationship between a health care provider and a service user, is a key factor in explaining the effects of mental health interventions. The Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM) is a well-validated measure of therapeutic alliance in face-to-face therapy., OBJECTIVE: , ""This study presented the first attempt to (1) explore service users views of the concept of relationship within mHealth mental health interventions and (2) adapt a well-validated face-to-face measure of therapeutic alliance, the Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM), for use with mHealth interventions."", METHODS: , In stage 1, we interviewed 9 mental health service users about the concept of therapeutic alliance in the context of a digital health intervention and derived key themes from interview transcripts using thematic analysis. In stage 2, we used rating scales and open-ended questions to elicit views from 14 service users and 10 mental health staff about the content and face validity of the scale, which replaced the word ""therapist"" with the word ""app."" In stage 3, we used the findings from stages 1 and 2 to adapt the measure with the support of a decision-making algorithm about which items to drop, retain, or adapt., RESULTS: , Findings suggested that service users do identify relationship concepts when thinking about mHealth interventions, including forming a bond with an app and the ability to be open with an app. However, there were key differences between relationships with health professionals and relationships with apps. For example, apps were not as tailored and responsive to each person\s unique needs. Furthermore, apps were not capable of portraying uniquely human-like qualities such as friendliness, collaboration, and agreement. We made a number of changes to the ARM that included revising 16 items; removing 4 items due to lack of suitable alternatives; and adding 1 item to capture a key theme derived from stage 1 of the study (""The app is like having a member of my care team in my pocket"")., CONCLUSIONS: , This study introduces the mHealth version of the ARM, the mARM, that has good face and content validity.

However, due to the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments, this may not be feasible. Adjunctive internet-based interventions specifically designed for youth may provide a cost-effective and engaging alternative to prevent loss of intervention benefits. However, until now online interventions have relied on human moderators to deliver therapeutic content. More sophisticated models responsive to user data are critical to inform tailored online therapy. Thus, integration of user experience with a sophisticated and cutting-edge technology to deliver content is necessary to redefine online interventions in youth mental health. This paper discusses the development of the moderated online social therapy (MOST) web application, which provides an interactive social media-based platform for recovery in mental health. We provide an overview of the systems main features and discus our current work regarding the incorporation of advanced computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement and improve the discovery and delivery of therapy content. "", Methods:, "" Our case study is the ongoing Horyzons site (5-year randomized controlled trial for youth recovering from early psychosis), which is powered by MOST. We outline the motivation underlying the project and the web applications foundational features and interface. We discuss system innovations, including the incorporation of pertinent usage patterns as well as identifying certain limitations of the system. This leads to our current motivations and focus on using computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement, and to further improve the system with novel mechanisms for the delivery of therapy content to users. In particular, we cover our usage of natural language analysis and chatbot technologies as strategies to tailor interventions and scale up the system. "", Conclusions:,  To date, the innovative MOST system has demonstrated viability in a series of clinical research trials. Given the data-driven opportunities afforded by the software system, observed usage patterns, and the aim to deploy it on a greater scale, an important next step in its evolution is the incorporation of advanced and automated content delivery mechanisms."

The empirical literature has identified design factors (e.g., variety and duration of activities) and moderators (e.g., personality traits) that can influence their effectiveness. A randomized controlled trial tested an empirically informed OPPI designed to promote self-efficacy and an optimistic outlook. Pessimism was included as a trait moderator. Method: Participants (N = 466) were English-speaking adults interested in becoming happier. They were randomly assigned to complete either an OPPI cultivating optimism or a control condition writing about daily activities for 3 weeks. Follow-up assessments occurred 1 and 2 months following the exercise period. Results: A hierarchical linear model analysis indicated that the optimism intervention increased the pursuit of engagement-related happiness in the short term and reduced dysfunctional attitudes across follow-ups. Pessimistic individuals had more to gain and reported fewer depressive symptoms at post-test. Conclusions: These findings support the conclusion that empirically informed online interventions can improve psychological well-being, at least in the short run, and may be particularly helpful when tailored to the needs of the individual.

A national sample of 123 mental health professionals (57.7% male) provided clinical judgments on 12 case vignettes primarily representing personality pathology; two identical versions of each vignette were prepared, with the only difference being the use of masculine or feminine pronouns identifying the client. Clinical judgments included evaluations of adaptive functioning, long-term prognostic assessments, short-term risk evaluations, and treatment recommendations. Analyses included intraclass correlations between clinicians to assess reliability, as well as an examination of the variance of clinical judgments as a function of the identified gender of the case and the gender of the participating clinician. No significant two-way interactions were found between case gender and clinician gender in predicting the clinical judgments. A significant main effect of case gender in predicting vocational functioning was observed, such that female cases were rated as having better estimated vocational functioning than male cases. In addition, a significant main effect of clinician gender in predicting aggression and violence risk was found, such that ratings by female clinicians were higher than ratings by male clinicians.

However, there are few published studies documenting the development of programs that can serve as a valuable tool for communication of optimal service delivery and common obstacles and challenges. Programs targeting low-income, ethnically diverse populations are particularly imperative given the existing socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in ASD assessment and diagnosis. This article outlines the development of the MetroHealth Autism Assessment Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, an interprofessional clinic targeting the assessment and diagnosis of ASDs in children ages 24 to 48 months from an inner-city underprivileged Medicaid population. In line with our goals of increasing diagnostic efficiency and care coordination, we examined clinical outcomes relative to preclinic data in time to diagnosis, number of providers seen prior to diagnosis, and number of “no-show” appointments. Results indicated significantly reduced time to diagnoses relative to preclinic data, likely associated with better care coordination. Number of providers seen and no-show appointments were not significantly different. Establishment of the clinic has enabled us to connect patients to community-based resources in a timely manner, potentially reducing disparities in ASD diagnosis and intervention. Obstacles have included scheduling monthly clinical staff meetings and procuring funding for a patient navigator.

Autistic children—purportedly the beneficiaries of these technologies—thus become a secondary audience to the largely externally defined purposes. We identify a lack of design for technologies that are geared towards the interests, needs and desires of autistic children.

Nevertheless, the study of the adherence in this type of the treatment reported divergent results. The main objective of this study is to analyze predictors of adherence in a primary care Internet-based intervention for depression in Spain. A multi-center, three arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 194 depressive patients, who were allocated in self-guided or supported-guided intervention. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were gathered using a case report form. The Mini international neuropsychiatric interview diagnoses major depression. Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess depression severity. The visual analogic scale assesses the respondents self-rated health and Short Form Health Survey was used to measure the health-related quality of life. Age results a predictor variable for both intervention groups (with and without therapist support). Perceived health is a negative predictor of adherence for the self-guided intervention when change in depression severity was included in the model. Change in depression severity results a predictor of adherence in the support-guided intervention. Our findings demonstrate that in our sample, there are differences in sociodemographic and clinical variables between active and dropout participants and we provide adherence predictors in each intervention condition of this Internet-based program for depression (self-guided and support-guided). It is important to point that further research in this area is essential to improve tailored interventions and to know specific patients groups can benefit from these interventions."""

Our research covers a full design process including a qualitative-empirical pre-study, the prototyping process and the investigation of long-term appropriation processes of the stable prototypes in three different practice environments. Specifically, we deal with the problem of wandering by persons suffering from late-phase dementia. Although GPS tracking is not a novel technological objective, the usage of those systems in dementia care remains very low. The paper therefore takes a socio-technical stance on development and appropriation of GPS technology in dementia care and assesses the practical and ideological issues surrounding care to understand why. We additionally provide design research in two different settings, familial and institutional care, and report on the design of a GPS-based tracking system reflecting these considerations. What comes to the fore is the need for ICT to reflect complex organizational, ideological and practical issues that form part of a moral universe where sensitivity is crucial."""

Drawing on an acculturation framework (Berry, 2003) and theories of coping (Folkman, 1984), resilience (Masten, 2001), and socioecological processes (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), this article provides an in-depth account of acculturative stress and coping behaviors experienced by Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong. Using qualitative research methods, we conducted seven focus groups with a total of 32 Mainland Chinese students from a public university in Hong Kong over a 3-month period. Analytic strategy included identifying the unit of analysis, coding, sorting code, checking code, and creating salient themes. Findings suggested that Mainland Chinese university students faced acculturative stress stemming from “language barriers,” “prejudice and discrimination,” “cultural differences,” and “transport, food, and accommodation.” The study also found that the participants used a number of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies in the face of acculturative stress. As an extension of this research, future studies should examine the subtle difference between a subculture (Hong Kong) and its mother culture (Mainland China) and how that affects acculturative stress.

One of the most widely recommended interventions is safety planning. However, few women experiencing violence access specialist services for safety planning. A safety decision aid, weighing the dangers of leaving or staying in an abusive relationship, gives women the opportunity to prioritise, plan and take action to increase safety for themselves and their children. This randomised controlled trial is testing the effectiveness of an innovative, interactive web-based safety decision aid. The trial is an international collaborative concurrent replication of a USA trial (IRIS study , NCT01312103, ), regionalised for the Aotearoa New Zealand culture and offers fully automated online trial recruitment, eligibility screening and consent., METHODS/DESIGN: , In a fully automated web-based trial (isafe) 340 abused women will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to a safety decision aid intervention or usual safety planning control website. Intervention components include: (a) safety priority setting, (b) danger assessment and (c) an individually tailored safety action plan. Self-reported outcome measures are collected at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post-baseline. Primary outcomes are depression (measured by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised) and IPV exposure (measured by Severity Violence Against Women Scale) at 12 months post-baseline. Secondary outcomes include PTSD, psychological abuse, decisional conflict, safety behaviors and danger in the relationship., DISCUSSION: , This trial will provide much-needed information on the potential relationships among safety planning, improved mental health, reduced violence as well as decreased decisional conflict related to safety in the abusive relationship. The novel web-based safety decision aid intervention may provide a cost-effective, easily accessed safety-planning resource that can be translated into clinical and community practice by multiple health disciplines and advocates. The trial will also provide information about how women in abusive relationships safely access safety information and resources through the Internet. Finally, the trial will inform other research teams on the feasibility and acceptability of fully automated recruitment, eligibility screening, consent and retention procedures., TRIAL REGISTRATION: , Trial registered on 03 July 2012 on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612000708853 ."

Transmedia storytelling interventions accessible on the Internet via smartphones, tablets, and computers hold promise for reducing reluctance to explore or get help for symptoms because they are private, convenient, and can reach large numbers of people, including Latinas with mental health needs., OBJECTIVE: , The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a mental health transmedia intervention for Latinas with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both., METHODS: , A total of 28 symptomatic English-speaking Latina women aged 21 to 48 years participated in a 6-week study using a within-group design. All aspects of the study were completed via telephone or Internet. Participants used their personal devices to engage the Web-based transmedia intervention (in English) that included story-based videos, a data-informed psychotherapeutic video, an interactive video sequence, and a blog written from the point of view of one of the characters with links to mental health resources. Perceived confidence to get help and perceived importance for seeking immediate help were both measured using single-item questions. Participants completed surveys at baseline (via telephone) and 1 and 6 weeks after media engagement that measured various factors, including depression (Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9 and PHQ-8) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale; GAD-7). A telephone interview was conducted within 72 hours of media engagement. Action taken or intentions to get help (single-item question) and talking about the videos with others (single-item question) were measured 1 and 6 weeks after media engagement. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess change in depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) before transmedia engagement and 1 and 6 weeks after. Spearman correlations evaluated the association of confidence and importance of getting help with action taken, anxiety, and depression., RESULTS: , All 28 Latinas (English speakers) who engaged with the transmedia remained in the 6-week study. Within 1 week of transmedia engagement, 39% of women took action to get help, and 82% discussed the media with others. Symptoms of depression (F, 2,54, =9.0, P<.001) and anxiety (F, 2,54, =18.7, P<.001) significantly reduced across time. Higher levels of confidence were significantly associated with actions taken at 1 (P=.005) and 6 weeks (P=.04), and higher levels of importance were significantly associated with actions taken at 1 (P=.009) and 6 weeks (P=.003). Higher levels of confidence were associated with lower levels of depression (P=.04) and anxiety (P=.01) at 6 weeks., CONCLUSIONS: , Preliminary findings indicate a culturally tailored mental health transmedia intervention is a feasible approach that holds promise for engaging large numbers of symptomatic English-speaking Latina women to begin the process of seeking help, as well as decreasing symptoms of anxiety and depression., MarySue V Heilemann, Patricia D Soderlund, Priscilla Kehoe, Mary-Lynn Brecht.

Parents and adolescents were assessed at baseline and 3 months later (postintervention). Parents in the intervention condition received PiP, a tailored Web-based parenting intervention designed following Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) principles to target parenting factors associated with adolescents risk for depression and anxiety problems. PiP comprises a tailored feedback report highlighting each parents strengths and areas for improvement, followed by a set of interactive modules (up to nine) that is specifically recommended for the parent based on individually identified areas for improvement. Parents in the active-control condition received a standardized package of five Web-based factsheets about adolescent development and well-being. Parents in both conditions received a 5-min weekly call to encourage progress through their allocated program to completion. Both programs were delivered weekly via the trial website. The primary outcome measure at postintervention was parent-reported changes in parenting risk and protective factors, which were measured using the Parenting to Reduce Adolescent Depression and Anxiety Scale (PRADAS). Secondary outcome measures were the adolescent-report PRADAS, the parent- and child-report Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (depressive symptoms), and parent- and child-report Spence Childrens Anxiety Scale (anxiety symptoms)."", RESULTS: , Parents in the intervention condition completed a mean of 73.7% of their intended personalized PiP program. A total of 318 parents (88.6%, 318/359) and 308 adolescents (92.8%, 308/332) completed the postintervention assessment.

This article reviewed published psychological interventions for AYAs with cancer, diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sickle cell disease, and asthma. Common, efficacious intervention components were examined to generate clearer recommendations for future age-appropriate, evidence-based intervention development. Methods: Five databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process & Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL, were searched for studies involving AYAs aged 10–30 years, using quantitative two-group methods, published from 1979–2010. Of 1,233 abstracts, 87 were extracted for further analysis and a final 25 studies were eligible for inclusion. Thirteen of these studies included AYAs with diabetes, 7 studies involved AYAs with cancer, and 5 included AYAs with other illnesses. Results: Educational interventions showed some significant positive results, particularly when targeted knowledge outcomes were measured. Several skills-based programs, some including parents, showed positive results, with moderate effect sizes. Interventions which taught communication skills, incorporated practical components (e.g., role-plays, homework), involved ≥6 sessions, and spanned at least 3 months in length, appeared more likely to achieve positive outcomes. Conclusions: Skills-based interventions delivered over multiple sessions may yield the most positive results in AYAs with chronic illness. Given the few peer-support groups eligible for review, their efficacy remains unclear. This review points to the need for intervention development that teaches adaptive coping skills, is grounded in theoretical frameworks, and adheres to strict randomization and independent assessments to evaluate efficacy in assisting AYAs adjust to chronic illness.

Empirical studies with qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods designs concerning tools and interventions for use in palliative care for people with SMI were included. Methodological quality was assessed using a critical appraisal instrument for heterogeneous study designs. Stepwise study selection and the assessment of methodological quality were done independently by two review authors., RESULTS: , Four studies were included, reporting on a total of two tools and one multi-component intervention. One study concerned a tool to identify the palliative phase in patients with SMI. This tool appeared to be usable only in people with SMI with a cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, two related studies focused on a tool to involve people with SMI in discussions about medical decisions at the end of life. This tool was assessed as feasible and usable in the target group. One other study concerned the Dutch national Care Standard for palliative care, including a multi-component intervention. The Palliative Care Standard also appeared to be feasible and usable in a mental healthcare setting, but required further tailoring to suit this specific setting. None of the included studies investigated the effects of the tools and interventions on quality of life or quality of care., CONCLUSIONS: , Studies of palliative care tools and interventions for people with SMI are scarce. The existent tools and intervention need further development and should be tailored to the care needs and settings of these people.

In response to these concerns, a recent policy initiative called “Zero Suicide” has advocated a systems-level response to the suicidal risk within health care and this policy initiative is yielding positive results (Hogan & Goldstein Grumet, 2016). Along these lines, a “stepped care” approach developed by Jobes (2016) has been adapted and used within the Zero Suicide curriculum as a model for systems-level care that is suicide-specific, evidence-based, least-restrictive, and cost-effective. The Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is an example of one suicide-specific evidence-based clinical intervention that can be adapted and used across the full range of stepped care service settings (Jobes, 2016). This article describes various applications and uses of CAMS at all service levels and highlights CAMS-related innovations.

Despite substantial evidence for the role of parents in the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders, there remains a need for translation of this evidence into preventive parenting interventions. To address this gap, we developed a single-session, Web-based, tailored psychoeducation intervention that aims to improve parenting practices known to influence the development of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders., OBJECTIVE: , The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of the intervention on parenting risk and protective factors and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescent participants., METHODS: , We conducted a single-blind, parallel group, superiority randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention with a 3-month waitlist control. The intervention is fully automated and consists of two components: (1) completion of an online self-assessment of current parenting practices against evidence-based parenting recommendations for the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders and (2) an individually tailored feedback report highlighting each parents strengths and areas for improvement based on responses to the self-assessment. A community sample of 349 parents, together with 327 adolescents (aged 12-15 years), were randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control condition. Parents and adolescents completed online self-reported assessments of parenting and adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, 1-month (parent-report of parenting only), and 3-month follow-up., RESULTS: , Compared with controls, intervention group parents showed significantly greater improvement in parenting risk and protective factors from baseline to 1-month and 3-month follow-up (F, 2,331.22, =16.36, P<.001), with a small to medium effect size at 3-month follow-up (d=0.33). There were no significant effects of the intervention on adolescent-report of parenting or symptoms of depression or anxiety in the adolescents (all P>.05)., CONCLUSIONS: , Findings suggest that a single-session, individually tailored, Web-based parenting intervention can improve parenting factors that are known to influence the development of depression and anxiety in adolescents. However, our results do not support the effectiveness of the intervention in improving adolescent depression or anxiety symptoms in the short-term. Long-term studies are required to adequately assess the relationship between improving parenting factors and adolescent depression and anxiety outcomes.

However, the salutogenic perspective suggests that adversity may not always be detrimental (Antonovsky, 1996). In fact, under certain circumstances, adversity may have the potential for positive outcomes, such as increased resilience and thriving (Carver, 1998; Rutter, 1987). The “steeling effect” suggests that past experiences of adversity may increase resistance to later adversities. It proposes that moderate adversity may facilitate more adaptive functioning than no adversity or high levels of adversity (Rutter, 2006, 2012). The relationship between adversity and health may be optimally assessed using curvilinear models, yet the majority of previous studies have examined linear associations (Masten & Cicchetti, 2016). It is therefore the aim of this review to determine whether moderate adversity is associated with more adaptive functioning when compared to no and high levels of adversity. Practical implications and future research are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

Of particular interest was the examination of a moderator of delivery method (face-to-face vs. online) in testing the effectiveness of psychological interventions. Also examined is the effect of two structural moderators (control condition type, sample characteristic). A total of 10 studies were identified (65 perfectionism effect sizes, 8 depression effect sizes, and 8 anxiety effect sizes). Psychological interventions were effective in decreasing perfectionism dimensions, depression, and anxiety with medium effect sizes. There were no significant differences in delivery modality, control condition type, and sample characteristic on effect sizes. Findings suggest that psychological interventions are generally effective in reducing perfectionism, although there is no apparent delineation in increasing “adaptive” perfectionism and decreasing “maladaptive” perfectionism. Although comparable benefits were shown in face-to-face and online intervention delivery modes, we suggest prudently incorporating online interventions into clinical practice.

Prevention strategies in early adolescence are designed to reduce substance use and progressions to problematic use by adulthood. This report examines the long-term effects of offering Family Check-up (FCU) at multiple time points in secondary education on the progression of substance use from age 11 to 23 years. Method: Participants (N = 998; 472 females) were randomly assigned individuals to intervention or control in Grade 6 and offered a multilevel intervention that included a classroom-based intervention (universal), the FCU (selected), and tailored family management treatment (indicated). Among intervention families, 23% engaged in the selected and indicated levels during middle school. Results: Intention to treat analyses revealed that randomization to the FCU was associated with reduced growth in marijuana use (p < .05), but not alcohol and tobacco use. We also examined whether engagement in the voluntary FCU services moderated the effect of the intervention on substance use progressions using complier average causal effect (CACE) modeling, and found that engagement in the FCU services predicted reductions in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use by age 23. In comparing engagers with nonengagers: 70% versus 95% showed signs of alcohol abuse or dependence, 28% versus 61% showed signs of tobacco dependence, and 59% versus 84% showed signs of marijuana abuse or dependence. Conclusion: Family interventions that are embedded within public school systems can reach high-risk students and families and prevent progressions from exploration to problematic substance use through early adulthood.

This study examines changes in the self-assessed and caregiver-assessed outcomes of people with schizophrenia after exposure to a cognitive adaptation training (CAT) guide that addressed pragmatic, in-home approaches to offset the cognitive impacts of the illness. Method: This study examined the 4-month, pre–post outcomes of a CAT guide, as compared with a popular, general manual, for families of individuals with schizophrenia. A total of 17 caregiver-supported individual dyads completed all measures, having been randomized to either a CAT-guide group or a support-manual group. Measures included medication adherence, adaptive functioning, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Semistructured interviews assessed use and utility questions. Results: Caregiver-assessed improvements in community functioning with medium–high effect sizes were observed in both study conditions. Self-report ratings by supported individuals did not change from baseline to 4 months and no change was observed in medication adherence or quality of life for either condition. Caregiver-burden ratings significantly declined with a large effect size, again with no difference as a function of manual type. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: These findings suggest that there is some promise in providing families with evidence-based information in manual form. Further research informed by this study’s findings should include assessments of whether and how environmental cognitive supports can be of specific benefit to families affected by schizophrenia.

A large number of people provide long-term support and care for a relative with psychosis. Although psychoeducational interventions, especially those delivered through a face-to-face group format, have an established evidence base for improving the caregiving experience, well-being, and health outcomes, large-scale implementation and access remain limited.

Alongside this, 2 rounds of focus group study with carers (n=24, in 4 groups) were conducted to seek consultation on end users views and ideas to optimize the intervention design and usability. Finally, the EAG carried out a Web-based walk-through exercise on the intervention prototype and further refined it to make it ready for an online usability test.

In this chapter, a framework for evidence based policy making is proposed, which integrates the usage of open big data coming from a multiplicity of sources with policy simulations. It encompasses the application of dynamic modelling methodologies and data mining techniques to extract knowledge from two types of data. On the one hand, objective data such as governmental and statistical data, are used to capture the interlinked policy domains and their underlying casual mechanisms. On the other hand, behavioural patterns and citizens opinions are extracted from Web 2.0 sources, social media posts, polls and statistical surveys. To combine this multimodal information, our approach suggests a modelling methodology that bases on big data acquisition and processing for the identification of significant factors and counterintuitive interrelations between them, which can be applied in any policy domain. Then, to allow the practical application of the framework an ICT architecture is designed, with the aim to overcome challenges related with big data management and processing. Finally, validation of the approach for driving policy design and implementation in the future in diverse policy domains, is suggested."""

Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared third wave CBT therapies with control conditions for acute depression in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information when required. We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results Four small studies (224 participants) were included in the review. Little information was provided about the process of allocating participants to groups. None of the studies used independent outcome assessors, and evidence suggested researcher allegiance towards the active treatments. The four studies examined a diversity of third wave CBT approaches (extended behavioural activation, acceptance and commitment therapy and competitive memory training) and control conditions. None of the studies conducted follow‐up assessments. The results showed a significant difference in clinical response rates in favour of third wave CBT when compared with treatment as usual (TAU) conditions (three studies, 170 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.95; very low quality). No significant difference in treatment acceptability based on dropout rates was found between third wave CBT approaches and TAU (four studies, 224 participants, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.08 to 12.30; very low quality). Both analyses showed substantial statistical heterogeneity. Authors conclusions Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT approaches appear to be more effective than treatment as usual in the treatment of acute depression. The very small number of available studies and the diverse types of interventions and control comparators, together with methodological limitations, limit the ability to draw any conclusions on their effect in the short term or over a longer term. The increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice underscores the importance of completing further studies of third wave CBT approaches in the treatment of acute depression, on a short‐ and long‐term basis, to provide evidence of their effectiveness to policy‐makers, clinicians and users of services. Plain language summary Third wave cognitive and behavioural therapies versus treatment as usual for depression Major depression is a very common condition in which people experience a persistently low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death. Psychological therapies are an important and popular alternative to antidepressants in the treatment of depression. Many different psychological therapy approaches have been developed over the past century, including cognitive‐behavioural (CBT), behavioural, third wave CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies. In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT), helping people to become aware of their thoughts and to accept them in a non‐judgemental way. The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was effective and acceptable to people in the acute phase of depression. The review included four studies, involving a total of 224 people. The studies examined three different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of extended behavioural activation (two studies), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (one study) and another form of third wave CBT called competitive mind training (one study). Three of the studies compared third wave CBT approaches with treatment as usual control conditions. The fourth study compared ACT with a psychological placebo condition. The results suggested that third wave CBT approaches were effective on a short‐term basis in treating depression. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies/participants included in the review, together with the diverse client groups, interventions and control conditions used and possible allegiance of researchers towards the active treatments, making it difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence. It is notable, too, that none of the studies looked at the long‐term effect of third wave CBT approaches. Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further well‐designed studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are helpful in treating people with acute depression."""

We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results A total of three studies involving 144 eligible participants were included in the review. Two of the studies (56 participants) compared an early version of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with CBT, and one study (88 eligible participants) compared extended behavioural activation with CBT. No other studies of third wave CBT were identified. The two ACT studies were assessed as being at high risk of performance bias and researcher allegiance. Post‐treatment results, which were based on dropout rates, showed no evidence of any difference between third wave CBT and other psychological therapies for the primary outcomes of efficacy (risk ratio (RR) of clinical response 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.64; very low quality) and acceptability. Results at two‐month follow‐up showed no evidence of any difference between third wave CBT and other psychological therapies for clinical response (2 studies, 56 participants, RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15). Moderate statistical heterogeneity was indicated in the acceptability analyses (I 2  = 41%). Authors conclusions Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT and CBT approaches are equally effective and acceptable in the treatment of acute depression. Evidence is limited in quantity, quality and breadth of available studies, precluding us from drawing any conclusions as to their short‐ or longer‐term equivalence. The increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice underscores the importance of completing further studies to compare various third wave CBT approaches with other psychological therapy approaches to inform clinicians and policymakers on the most effective forms of psychological therapy in treating depression. Plain language summary Third wave cognitive and behavioural therapies versus other psychological therapies for depression Major depression is a very common condition, in which people experience persistently low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death. Psychological therapies are an important and popular alternative to antidepressants in the treatment of depression. Many different psychological therapy approaches have been developed over the past century, including behavioural, cognitive‐behavioural (CBT), third wave CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies. In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT) to help people become aware of their thoughts and accept them in a non‐judgemental way. The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was more effective and acceptable than other psychological therapy approaches for people with acute depression. The review included three studies, involving a total of 144 people. The studies examined two different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (two studies) and extended behavioural activation (BA) (one study). All three studies compared these third wave CBT approaches with CBT. The results suggested that third wave CBT and CBT approaches were equally effective in treating depression. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies of poor quality that we included in the review; therefore it is not possible to conclude whether third wave CBT approaches might be more effective and acceptable than other psychological therapies in the short term or over a longer period of time. Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are more helpful than other psychological therapies in treating people with acute depression."""

Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are specific interventional approaches designed to address difficulties with memory and other aspects of cognitive functioning. The present review is an update of previous versions of this review. Objectives The main aim of the current review was to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild Alzheimers disease or vascular dementia in relation to important cognitive and non‐cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia and the primary caregiver in the short, medium and long term. Search methods The CDCIG Specialized Register, ALOIS, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS and many other clinical trial databases and grey literature sources, was most recently searched on 2 November 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, comparing cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive training interventions with control conditions, and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the family caregiver, were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Eleven RCTs reporting cognitive training interventions were included in the review. A large number of measures were used in the different studies, and meta‐analysis could be conducted for 11 of the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. The unit of analysis in the meta‐analysis was the change from baseline score. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated using a fixed‐effect model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured using a standard Chi 2  statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing examination of effect sizes, but no meta‐analysis could be conducted. Main results Cognitive training was not associated with positive or negative effects in relation to any reported outcomes. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate. The single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation found promising results in relation to a number of participant and caregiver outcomes, and was generally of high quality. Authors conclusions Available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. However, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. The results of the single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. Further, well‐designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. Researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately using available terminology. Plain language summary Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for mild to moderate Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and vascular disease is an enormous public health problem. Currently, an estimated 36 million people worldwide live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective interventions to reduce the burden of disease are urgently needed. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are non‐pharmacological methods that aim to help people with early‐stage dementia make the most of their memory and cognitive functioning despite the difficulties they are experiencing. Cognitive training focuses on guided practice on a set of tasks that reflect particular cognitive functions, such as memory, attention or problem‐solving. Cognitive rehabilitation focuses on identifying and addressing individual needs and goals, which may require strategies for taking in new information or compensatory methods such as using memory aids. This review included 11 trials of cognitive training and a single trial of cognitive rehabilitation. We found no evidence for the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive functioning, mood or activities of daily living in people with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease or vascular dementia; however the quality of the studies was generally not high. The single trial of cognitive rehabilitation provided preliminary indications of the potential benefits of individual cognitive rehabilitation in improving activities of daily living in people with mild Alzheimers disease. More high‐quality trials of both cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are needed to establish their efficacy for people with early‐stage dementia."""

The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common and are distinguished primarily on the basis of whether or not parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year. Patients with both conditions have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, blocking its breakdown using cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement. Objectives To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD), and cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease falling short of dementia (CIND‐PD) (considered as separate phenomena and also grouped together as Lewy body disease). Search methods The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (on 30 August 2011) using the search terms Lewy, Parkinson, PDD, DLB, LBD. This register consists of records from major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly. Reference lists of relevant studies were searched for additional trials. Selection criteria Randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB, PDD and CIND‐PD. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from published reports by one review author (MR). The data for each condition (that is DLB, PDD or CIND‐PD) were considered separately and, where possible, also pooled. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.0. Main results Six trials met the inclusion criteria for this review, in which a total of 1236 participants were randomised. Four of the trials were of a parallel group design and two cross‐over trials were included. Four of the trials included participants with a diagnosis of PDD ( Aarsland 2002a ;  Dubois 2007 ;  Emre 2004 ;  Ravina 2005 ), of which Dubois 2007 remains unpublished (n = 550).  Leroi 2004  included patients with cognitive impairment and Parkinsons disease (both with and without dementia). Patients with DLB were included in only one of the trials ( McKeith 2000 ). For global assessment, three trials comparing cholinesterase inhibitor treatment to placebo in PDD ( Aarsland 2002a ;  Emre 2004 ;  Ravina 2005 ) reported a difference in the Alzheimers Disease Cooperative Study‐Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS‐CGIC) score of ‐0.38, favouring the cholinesterase inhibitors (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.56 to ‐0.24, P < 0.0001). A clinically meaningful improvement was observed in 19.8% of patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, compared to 14.5% of those in the placebo group. For cognitive function, a pooled estimate of the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function measures was consistent with the presence of a therapeutic benefit (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.23, P < 0.00001). There was evidence of a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with PDD (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.09, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.73, P = 0.0008) and in the single PDD and CIND‐PD trial (WMD 1.05, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.68, P = 0.01) but not in the single DLB trial. For behavioural disturbance, analysis of the pooled continuous data relating to behavioural disturbance rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.36 to ‐0.04, P = 0.01). For activities of daily living, combined data for the ADCS and the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.02, P = 0.03). For safety and tolerability, those taking a cholinesterase inhibitor were more likely to experience an adverse event (318/452 versus 668/842; odds ratio (OR) 1.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.15, P = 0.0003) and to drop out (128/465 versus 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.84, P = 0.0006). Adverse events were more common amongst those taking rivastigmine (357/421 versus 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.38, P < 0.0001) but not those taking donepezil (311/421 versus 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.80, P = 0.25). Parkinsonian symptoms in particular tremor (64/739 versus 12/352; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.09, P = 0.002), but not falls (P = 0.39), were reported more commonly in the treatment group but this did not have a significant impact on the UPDRS (total and motor) scores (P = 0.71). Fewer deaths occurred in the treatment group than in the placebo group (4/465 versus 9/279; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84, P = 0.03). Authors conclusions The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales. However, almost half of the trial data, which could potentially change this conclusion, have not been made public. The effect in DLB remains unclear. There is no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND‐PD. Plain language summary Cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for people with Parkinsons disease and dementia The clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinsons disease with dementia (PDD) have much in common. As patients with DLB and PDD have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, blocking its breakdown using a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement. Six trials showed a statistically significant improvement in global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales in PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinsons disease (CIND‐PD) patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. There was no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND‐PD. In a single trial, no statistically significant improvement was observed in patients with DLB who were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and further trials are necessary to clarify the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient group."""

In the interim, additional as required doses of medication can be used to calm patients in psychiatric wards. The practice is widespread, with 20% to 50% of people on acute psychiatric wards receiving at least one as required dose of psychotropic medication during their admission. Objectives To compare the effects of as required medication regimens with regular patterns of medication for the treatment of psychotic symptoms or behavioural disturbance, thought to be secondary to psychotic illness. These regimens may be given alone or in addition to any regular psychotropic medication for the long‐term treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials, in November 2001, March 2006, July 2012 andOctober 2013. Selection criteria We aimed to include all relevant randomised controlled trials involving hospital inpatients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses, comparing any regimen of medication administered for the short‐term relief of behavioural disturbance, or psychotic symptoms, to be given at the discretion of ward staff (as required, prn) with fixed non‐discretionary patterns of drug administration of the same drug(s). This was in addition to regular psychotropic medication for the long‐term treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses where prescribed. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected abstracts and papers for inclusion. If trials had been found, we would have extracted data from the papers and quality assessed the data. For dichotomous data we would have calculated the risk ratios (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We would have conducted analyses on an intention‐to‐treat basis. If data were available we would have completed a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results We have not been able to identify any randomised trials comparing as required medication regimens to regular regimens of the same drug. Our main outcomes of interest were important changes in (i) mental state, (ii) behaviour, (iii) dose of medication used, (iv) adverse events, (v) satisfaction with care and (iv) cost of care. Authors conclusions There is currently no evidence from within randomised trials to support this common practice. Current practice is based on clinical experience and habit rather than high quality evidence. Plain language summary As required medication for seriously mentally ill people in hospital Review question This review attempts to find evidence to find out whether the use of as required medication is good clinical practice or not, when compared to the same drug given regularly, for people with schizophrenia who are in hospital. Searches for randomised trials investigating this question have been run by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2001, 2006, 2012 and 2013. Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions) that can be upsetting or frightening, or both. These symptoms of schizophrenia can cause agitation, aggression and distress. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs usually take several weeks to work. In the meantime, for people in distress in hospital, other additional medication can be given when needed (if clinicians think it is appropriate), until regular antipsychotics start to work. This as required medication is often used to help people feel less anxious and to reduce disturbed behaviour. As required medication is usually written on the drug chart by the clinician so that nurses can administer it at their discretion and in the doctors absence. Although there are many advantages to this practice, there are also potential disadvantages. For example, it may cause difficulty in knowing which medication (the prescribed medication or the as required medication) has been effective and staff on the ward might use this additional medication too readily for individuals who are upset, rather than spending time with them or considering other approaches. Study characteristics The search only found trials that compared two different drugs, both of which were used as required. The review authors found no trials that compared only giving additional medication when needed with regular doses of the same medication. Key results The review authors found no trials that could be included in the review. Although the practice of using medication as required is common, there is currently no good evidence as to whether this is the best way of helping people when compared to them being given a regular dose of the same medication. Quality of the evidence The review authors found no trials that compared as required with regular medication. As required medication, though used widely, has not been evaluated scientifically. A well designed, conducted and reported randomised trial would help to gather more evidence. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation,  http"""

The prevalence of wandering by people with dementia is difficult to assess; wandering is not a simple or static behaviour and the reasons why people wander remain unclear. In the absence of a theory of wandering and an agreed definition of wandering, it is difficult to discover effective strategies for managing wandering and difficult to design appropriate intervention strategies. Also, the same behaviour or type of wandering might occur for different reasons in different individuals; any theoretical formulation is going to have to allow for different triggers for the behaviour and so to get a one size fits all kind of explanation is unlikely. Thus what we mostly encounter in this field is a trial and error approach which does not always do justice to the complex interactions of personal and environmental factors that lead people with dementia to wander. While there seems to be a consensus in the literature that in the majority of cases non‐pharmacological approaches may work as well as drug treatment and with fewer side effects, in practice clinicians often resort to drugs as the first line of treatment. This review reports the lack of evidence from RCTs and discusses the range of non‐pharmacological interventions that have been carried out using other study designs. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions in reducing wandering in the domestic setting by people with dementia. The secondary objective is to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence available and to set an agenda for future research.

Where possible we converted continuous outcomes into dichotomous outcomes. When this was not possible we used mean differences (MD) for continuous variables. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a Summary of findings table. Main results Only two studies, with a total of 65 participants, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Overall the quality of the two studies was low, with small study populations and significant sources of bias, so we were not able to use all the data in our comparisons. . The studies were old from 1968 and 1972, and would be unlikely to pass modern peer review standard. We were only able to find short‐term data and only trials randomising zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. We also hoped to identify data for zuclopenthixol acetate versus placebo and zuclopenthixol decanoate versus placebo comparisons. We were unable to identify any studies that included data on these two fairly widely used drugs. For our primary outcome of interest, clinically significant improvement, we found one study that provided useable data. Global state measured by clinical global impression scale (CGI) improvement showed different ratings when assessed by a psychiatrist or a nurse.The psychiatrist scores failed to achieve statistical significance, however when assessed by nursing staff, the difference favouring zuclopenthixol did reach statistical significance (1 RCT n = 29, RR 2.57 95% CI 1.06 to 6.20, very low quality data). There was also evidence of increased sedation with those treated with zuclopenthixol when compared with placebo (1 RCT n = 29, RR 4.67 95% CI 1.23 to 17.68, very low quality data). Leaving the study early data were equivocal. No useable data were available for outcomes such as relapse, mental state, death, quality of life, service use or economic costs. Authors conclusions For people with schizophrenia this review shows that zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride may help with the symptoms of schizophrenia. The review provides some trial evidence that, if taking zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, people may experience some adverse effects and sedation compared with placebo. However this evidence is of very low quality and with some significant sources of bias. There are no data for zuclopenthixol decanoate or zuclopenthixol acetate. For clinicians, the available trial data on the absolute effectiveness of zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride do support its use but the limited nature of the data and significant sources of bias make conclusions hard to draw. Zuclopenthixol in all three forms is a commonly used antipsychotic and it is disappointing that there are so few data regarding its use. Plain language summary Zuclopenthixol versus placebo for people with schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Zuclopenthixol is an older antipsychotic drug, first introduced in 1962, that has three distinct formulations zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride, zuclopenthixol acetate (or Acuphase), and zuclopenthixol decanoate. Although zuclopenthixol has been in common use for many years, no previous systematic review of its effectiveness compared to placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) in schizophrenia has been undertaken. Given the widespread use of this drug, it is important to look at the effectiveness of all three formulations of this commonly‐used drug so that health professionals, policy makers and people with schizophrenia can make better‐informed choices. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing zuclopenthixol with placebo in 2013. We found only two studies with 65 participants which could be included in this review. Overall the quality of these studies was low, with small numbers of people and significant bias. The studies were old, from 1968 and 1972, and would be unlikely to pass modern peer review standards. Only short‐term information and data could be found, and only about zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride. The information is very limited but suggests that zuclopenthixol can lead to improvement in global state in comparison with placebo. However, there is also increased risk of side effects such as sedation,and tiredness. Given the low quality of information and age of the two studies, further research is needed, particularly further research on zuclopenthixol compared to newer and more recent antipsychotic drugs."""

However, the atypical class of antipsychotic drugs are making important inroads into this approach. Atypical is a widely used term used to describe some antipsychotics which have a low propensity to produce movement disorders and raise serum prolactin. There is some suggestion that the different adverse effect profiles of atypical antipsychotic group make them more acceptable to people with schizophrenia. Ziprasidone is one of the newer atypicals with a high serotonin receptor affinity. Objectives To determine the effects of ziprasidone compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses. Search methods Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980‐1999), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (January 1999), CINAHL (1982‐1999), EMBASE (1980‐1999), MEDLINE (1966‐1999), LILACS (1982‐1996), PSYNDEX (1977‐1999) and PsycLIT (1974‐1999) were undertaken. In addition, pharmaceutical databases on the Dialog Corporation Datastar and Dialog services were searched. References of all identified studies were searched for further trials. Pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer ‐ the manufacturer of ziprasidone ‐ and the manufacturers of all comparator drugs) and first authors of all included trials were contacted. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that compared ziprasidone to other treatments for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses were included by independent assessment. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. Data were independently extracted. Data were excluded if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For homogeneous dichotomous data the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, weighted mean differences were calculated (WMD). All data were inspected for heterogeneity. Main results Data for this compound range from very short (one week) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over six months. For measures of mental state ziprasidone seems more effective than placebo (RR 0.8 CI 0.7‐0.9) and as effective as haloperidol (RR 0.8 CI 0.7‐1). It is less likely than haloperidol to cause movement disorders (RR 0.4 CI 0.2‐0.6), but causes more nausea and vomiting (RR 2.1 CI 1.2‐3.8). The injected form of the drug causes more pain at the injection site than haloperidol (RR 5.3 CI 1.3‐22). Authors conclusions Currently data are limited. Ziprasidone may be an effective antipsychotic with less extrapyramidal effects than haloperidol. It also, however, causes more nausea and vomiting than the typical drugs, and, at present, there is no data suggesting that it is different to other atypical compounds. Well planned, conducted and reported long term randomised trials are needed if ziprasidone is to be accepted into everyday use.

These included mental state (improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 to 0.88, medium‐quality evidence), social functioning (improvement in Social Occupational Functioning Scale, 1 RCT, n = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 to 1, medium‐quality evidence), quality of life (average change 36‐Item Short Form Survey (SF‐36) quality‐of‐life subscale, 1 RCT, n = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 to 26.73, low‐quality evidence), and leaving the study early (8 RCTs, n = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 to 1.37, medium‐quality evidence ) .

Only one study reported adverse effects, finding no incidence of adverse events in either treatment group. This review was subject to a considerable number of missing outcomes, which included global state, change in cognition, costs of care, effect on standard care, service intervention, disability, and activities of daily living. Authors conclusions Even though we found some positive evidence in favour of yoga over standard‐care control, this should be interpreted cautiously in view of outcomes largely based each on one study with limited sample sizes and short‐term follow‐up. Overall, many outcomes were not reported and evidence presented in this review is of low to moderate quality ‐ ‐too weak to indicate that yoga is superior to standard‐care control for the management of schizophrenia. Plain language summary Yoga versus standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga effective as an add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia? Background Yoga comes from ancient India and involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise, improving strength, flexibility, co‐ordination, endurance, and breathing control and concentration. Yoga has also been shown to reduce stress and promote health and feelings of well‐being. Yoga has been used as a complementary therapy for many health conditions, including improving blood pressure control as well as mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Some research suggests that yoga could also be of benefit as an add‐on treatment to reduce the complex symptoms of schizophrenia (such as hearing voices, seeing things, lack of interest in people and activities, tiredness, loss of emotions and withdrawal) and improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga and its use specifically for people with schizophrenia is under‐researched. Study characteristics We included eight short‐term studies (less than six months) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga or standard care in this review. The yoga programmes described varied from 45 minutes to 1 hour in length, and from 8 sessions to a maximum of 36 sessions. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register in January 2015. All studies continued prescribed antipsychotic treatment for the participants. Key results Some results suggest that yoga may be beneficial for people with schizophrenia. Yoga may be beneficial to mental state, social functioning and quality of life but the available evidence is weak and needs to be treated with a good degree of caution. No adverse effects were found by the one trial that reported this outcome. Several other important outcomes were not addressed by the studies, including changes in cognition, economic considerations, and daily living activities. There was not enough good‐quality evidence in this review to claim that yoga should be prescribed as an add‐on to standard care for schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short‐term follow‐up was reported.

Searching for evidence We ran electronic searches for trials (latest search was in March 2017) for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive yoga or another add‐on treatment. One thousand and thirty four records were found and checked by the review authors. Evidence found Six trials with 586 participants met the review requirements and provided useable data. Other add‐on treatments consisted of other forms of exercise only. There is little evidence currently available, is low quality, and suggests that yoga is no more effective than other add‐on treatments for schizophrenia. Conclusions Current evidence from randomised controlled trials shows yoga is no more effective than other add on treatments for schizophrenia, but the only available comparators to yoga were other forms of exercise. The evidence is weak as the number of studies available was small, and only short‐term follow‐up was reported.

Overall, this review has an inordinate number of missing key outcomes, which included mental and global state, social functioning, physical health, adverse effects and costs of care.

Plain language summary Yoga as a package of care versus standard care for schizophrenia Review question Is yoga, delivered as part of a larger package of care, effective for people with schizophrenia compared with standard care? Background Yoga involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise for reduction of stress and promotion of health and feelings of well‐being. Schizophrenia is a mental illness where people experience symptoms such as hearing voices that are not there, poor emotional response and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia often affects people for long periods of their life and is treated primarily by antipsychotic medications. However, these medications are not always fully effective and some research suggests that yoga as an add‐on treatment could be beneficial and help improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga can be combined with other therapies such as counselling or other forms of exercise into a package of care. Study characteristics Only three short‐term studies (lasting eight weeks) that randomised people with schizophrenia to either receive sessions of yoga as a package of care or standard care could be included in this review. Yoga was combined with drama, music and dance in one study, with a motivational and feedback session in another study. The final study included in this review combined yoga with counselling and an interactive question and answer session.The relative contribution of yoga was not clearly outlined in these studies. We found these studies by electronic searching of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register in March 2017. All participants continued to receive their prescribed antipsychotic treatment during their trial. Key results Many important outcomes were not addressed by the studies in this review, including mental, physical and social functioning, adverse effects and economic considerations. There may have been some small changes in quality of life in favour of the yoga package but overall there was not enough good‐quality evidence in this review to make any robust claims that yoga as a package of care should be prescribed as an add‐on to standard care for schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and weak. The number of included studies was small, and only short‐term follow‐up for two outcomes were reported. Schizophrenia often is a long‐term illness and more, larger, and long‐term trials that focus on important outcomes are necessary."""

It has been of interest for people with schizophrenia to determine the efficacy of yoga delivered as a package of care versus non‐standard care. Objectives To examine the effects of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care for schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (latest 15 May 2018) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PsychINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with schizophrenia comparing yoga as part of a package of care with non‐standard care. Data collection and analysis There were no data to analyse as no studies met the inclusion criteria. Main results The searches identified 30 studies that could be relevant to this review. After careful inspection, 29 were excluded and one is ongoing. No data were available for analyses. Authors conclusions In view of the lack of evidence from RCTs, it is currently not possible for us to comment on the use of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care. Plain language summary Yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care Review question Is yoga, delivered as part of a larger package of care, effective for people with schizophrenia compared with non‐standard care? Background Yoga involves physical postures and breathing exercises to promote balance between mind and body. Yoga has now been widely adopted as a method of relaxation and exercise for reduction of stress and promotion of health and feelings of well‐being. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where people experience symptoms such as hearing voices that are not there, poor emotional response and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia often affects people for long periods of their life and is treated primarily by antipsychotic medications. However, these medications are not always fully effective and some research suggests that yoga as an add‐on treatment could be beneficial and help improve the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Yoga can be combined with other therapies such as counselling or other forms of exercise into a package of care. Non‐standard care can consist of talking therapies, expressive therapies (art, dance, drama, music and writing) and other forms of exercise. Searching for evidence In May 2018, the Information Specialist for Cochrane Schizophrenia searched Cochrane Schizophrenias specialised register of randomised controlled trials for trials of people with schizophrenia. Thirty studies were found that could be relevant. The review authors carefully inspected full‐text versions of these studies, checking that they were randomised controlled trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive, in addition to their ongoing care, either yoga as part of a package of care or another type of non‐standard care intervention. Twenty‐nine of these studies did not meet the above inclusion criteria and are excluded from the review. One study is ongoing as data are not available at the moment. Key results Currently, there are no data available from randomised controlled trials regarding the effects of yoga as part of a package of care compared with non‐standard care for people with schizophrenia. Quality of the evidence Currenlty, there is no high‐quality evidence to support or discourage the use of yoga as part of a package of care versus non‐standard care. Schizophrenia is often a long‐term illness and studies which compare yoga packages to other types of therapies are necessary."""

When behavioural strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. Objectives To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants behaviour and assess safety. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018. Selection criteria We included all randomised, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  We rated the quality of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update. One trial was conducted in a community setting, eight in nursing homes and one in both settings. Different types of antipsychotics at varying doses were discontinued in the studies. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. Reported data were predominantly from studies at low or unclear risk of bias. We included nine trials with 575 randomised participants that used a proxy outcome for overall success of antipsychotic withdrawal. Pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Based on assessment of seven studies, discontinuation may make little or no difference to whether or not participants complete the study (low‐quality evidence). Two trials included only participants with psychosis, agitation or aggression who had responded to antipsychotic treatment. In these two trials, stopping antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of leaving the study early due to symptomatic relapse or a shorter time to symptomatic relapse. We found low‐quality evidence that discontinuation may make little or no difference to overall NPS, measured using various scales (7 trials, 519 participants). There was some evidence from subgroup analyses in two trials that discontinuation may reduce agitation for participants with less severe NPS at baseline, but may be associated with a worsening of NPS in participants with more severe NPS at baseline. None of the studies assessed withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects of antipsychotics (such as falls) were not systematically assessed. Low‐quality evidence showed that discontinuation may have little or no effect on adverse events (5 trials, 381 participants), quality of life (2 trials, 119 participants), or cognitive function (5 trials, 365 participants). There were insufficient data to determine whether discontinuation of antipsychotics has any effect on mortality (very low‐quality evidence). Authors conclusions There is low‐quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality. People with psychosis, aggression or agitation who responded well to long‐term antipsychotic drug use, or those with more severe NPS at baseline, may benefit behaviourally from continuation of antipsychotics. Discontinuation may reduce agitation for people with mild NPS at baseline. However, these conclusions are based on few studies or small subgroups and further evidence of benefits and harms associated with withdrawal of antipsychotic is required in people with dementia and mild and severe NPS. The overall conclusions of the review have not changed since 2013 and the number of available trials remains low. Plain language summary Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia Review question We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. Background People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. Methods We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. Results We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. Quality of the evidence Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. Conclusions Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low."""

It is expressed as a variety of symptoms and is associated with substantial impairment. Despite a range of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment options, there is still room for improvement of the pharmacological treatment of depression in terms of efficacy and tolerability. The latest available antidepressant is vortioxetine. It is assumed that vortioxetine\s antidepressant action is related to a direct modulation of serotonergic receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin transporter. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is claimed to be novel. Vortioxetine was placed in the category of ""Other"" antidepressants and may therefore provide an alternative to existing antidepressant drugs.

Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age‐associated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6, comprising three chemically distinct compounds, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine, is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood. Vitamin B6 is also an essential homocysteine re‐methylation cofactor, and deficiency is associated with an increase in blood homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and may also have directly toxic effects on neurons of the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric disorders including seizures, migraine, chronic pain and depression have been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Epidemiological studies indicate that poor vitamin B6 status is common among older people.

It has been suggested that various different vitamin and mineral supplements might be useful in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of dementia. In this review, we sought to examine the evidence for this in people who already had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objectives To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACs, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP, from inception to 25 January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised, placebo‐controlled trials which evaluated orally administered vitamin or mineral supplements in participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and which assessed the incidence of dementia or cognitive outcomes, or both. We were interested in studies applicable to the general population of older people and therefore excluded studies in which participants had severe vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Data collection and analysis We sought data on our primary outcomes of dementia incidence and overall cognitive function and on secondary outcomes of episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, quality of life, functional performance, clinical global impression, adverse events, and mortality. We conducted data collection and analysis according to standard Cochrane systematic review methods. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of bias assessment tool. We grouped vitamins and minerals according to their putative mechanism of action and, where we considered it to be clinically appropriate, we pooled data using random‐effects methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each comparison and outcome. Main results We included five trials with 879 participants which investigated B vitamin supplements. In four trials, the intervention was a combination of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid; in one, it was folic acid only. Doses varied. We considered there to be some risks of performance and attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting among these trials. Our primary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of dementia and scores on measures of overall cognitive function. None of the trials reported the incidence of dementia and the evidence on overall cognitive function was of very low‐quality. There was probably little or no effect of B vitamins taken for six to 24 months on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life. The evidence on our other secondary clinical outcomes, including harms, was very sparse or very low‐quality. There was evidence from one study that there may be a slower rate of brain atrophy over two years in participants taking B vitamins. The same study reported subgroup analyses based on the level of serum homocysteine (tHcy) at baseline and found evidence that B vitamins may improve episodic memory in those with tHcy above the median at baseline. We included one trial (n = 516) of vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E was given as 1000 IU of alpha‐tocopherol twice daily. We considered this trial to be at risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. There was probably no effect of vitamin E on the probability of progression from MCI to Alzheimers dementia over three years (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41; n = 516; 1 study, moderate‐quality evidence). There was also no evidence of an effect at intermediate time points. The available data did not allow us to conduct analyses, but the authors reported no significant effect of three years of supplementation with vitamin E on overall cognitive function, episodic memory, speed of processing, clinical global impression, functional performance, adverse events, or mortality (five deaths in each group). We considered this to be low‐quality evidence. We included one trial (n = 256) of combined vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation and one trial (n = 26) of supplementation with chromium picolinate. In both cases, there was a single eligible cognitive outcome, but we considered the evidence to be very low‐quality and so could not be sure of any effects. Authors conclusions The evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements as treatments for MCI is very limited. Three years of treatment with high‐dose vitamin E probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia, but we have no data on this outcome for other supplements. Only B vitamins have been assessed in more than one RCT. There is no evidence for beneficial effects on cognition of supplementation with B vitamins for six to 24 months. Evidence from a single study of a reduced rate of brain atrophy in participants taking vitamin B and a beneficial effect of vitamin B on episodic memory in those with higher tHcy at baseline warrants attempted replication. Plain language summary Vitamin and mineral supplementation for preventing dementia or delaying cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment Review question This review investigated whether people with mild cognitive impairment can reduce their risk of developing dementia, or can prevent their memory or other thinking skills from deteriorating further, by taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Background Slight changes in memory and thinking skills are common as people get older. When these changes are worse than can be expected in normal ageing, but are not bad enough to make a persons usual activities difficult to manage, then the person is said to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia in the future. Vitamins and minerals are naturally occurring substances which are needed in the diet to maintain health. They have lots of different functions in the body and many are essential to keep the brain working properly. It has been suggested that supplementing a persons normal diet with extra doses of these vitamins or minerals might help to maintain thinking skills or prevent dementia. Study characteristics We found eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which investigated four different types of vitamin or mineral pills by comparing them to a placebo (a dummy pill). The vitamins tested were B vitamins (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid), vitamin E, and vitamin E and C given together. The only mineral tested was chromium. Key results and quality of the evidence Vitamin B combination versus placebo Five trials with a total of 879 participants compared B vitamins with placebo. Four used combinations of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid; one small study tested folic acid on its own. None of these studies reported whether or not participants developed dementia. These studies did not find that memory or thinking skills differed between the group of people who took vitamin B supplements and those who took placebo after treatment lasting six months to two years. Our confidence in the results on different tests used in the studies varied from moderate to very low. Two years of vitamin B supplements did seem to help memory in a small subgroup of participants in one study who could be identified by a particular blood test at the start of the trial. One study found that there was probably no effect on participants quality of life. One study scanned the brains of some participants and reported that B vitamins may slow the rate of brain shrinkage. Harmful effects and deaths were reported in very few participants and we cannot conclude whether or not there are harms from taking these or similar combinations of B vitamins. Vitamin E versus placebo. One study with 516 participants compared a relatively high dose of vitamin E (2000 IU a day) to placebo in people who were also taking a multivitamin containing 15 IU of vitamin E (the daily requirement for vitamin E is approximately 30 IU). The risk of developing dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (the commonest form of dementia) is probably not affected by three years of treatment with high‐dose vitamin E. The quality of the evidence for other outcomes was lower, but there may also be no effect of this dose of vitamin E on specific memory or thinking skills or on how well people could manage their daily activities. Vitamin E and C versus placebo One study with 256 participants compared a combination of vitamins C and E with placebo. It found no effect on overall memory and thinking skills, but we had little confidence in this result because of the quality of the evidence. Chromium picolinate versus placebo Only one very small study with 26 participants investigated the effect of chromium supplements. This study was too small for us to be able to draw any conclusions. Conclusions The amount and quality of research evidence about vitamin and mineral supplements for treating MCI in people without nutritional deficiency is limited. At the moment, it is not possible to identify any supplements which can reduce the risk of people with MCI developing dementia or which can effectively treat their symptoms. More research is needed before we can answer our review question."""

Supplementation of the diet with various vitamins and minerals has been suggested as a means of maintaining cognitive function, or even of preventing dementia, in later life. Objectives To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people aged 40 years or more. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP from inception to 26th January 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the cognitive effects on people aged 40 years or more of any vitamin or mineral supplements taken by mouth for at least three months. Data collection and analysis Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were done in duplicate. Vitamins were considered broadly in the categories of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and combinations of both. Minerals were considered separately, where possible. If interventions and outcomes were considered sufficiently similar, then data were pooled. In order to separate short‐term cognitive effects from possible longer‐term effects on the trajectory of cognitive decline, data were pooled for various treatment durations from 3 months to 12 months and up to 10 years or more. Main results In total, we included 28 studies with more than 83,000 participants. There were some general limitations of the evidence. Most participants were enrolled in studies which were not designed primarily to assess cognition. These studies often had no baseline cognitive assessment and used only brief cognitive assessments at follow‐up. Very few studies assessed the incidence of dementia. Most study reports did not mention adverse events or made only very general statements about them. Only 10 studies had a mean follow‐up > 5 years. Only two studies had participants whose mean age was < 60 years at baseline. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low, other than a risk of attrition bias for longer‐term outcomes. We considered the certainty of the evidence behind almost all results to be moderate or low. We included 14 studies with 27,882 participants which compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these to placebo. The majority of participants were aged over 60 years and had a history of cardio‐ or cerebrovascular disease. We found that giving B vitamin supplements to cognitively healthy adults, mainly in their 60s and 70s, probably has little or no effect on global cognitive function at any time point up to 5 years (SMD values from ‐0.03 to 0.06) and may also have no effect at 5‐10 years (SMD ‐0.01). There were very sparse data on adverse effects or on incidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. We included 8 studies with 47,840 participants in which the active intervention was one or more of the antioxidant vitamins"

Virtual reality may take different forms to simulate real‐life activities and support treatment. Objectives To investigate the effects of virtual reality to support treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (most recent, 17th September 2013) and relevant reference lists. Selection criteria All relevant randomised studies comparing virtual reality with standard care for those with serious mental illnesses. We defined virtual reality as a computerised real‐time technology using graphics, sound and other sensory input, which creates the interactive computer‐mediated world as a therapeutic tool. Data collection and analysis All review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data the risk difference (RD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias and created a \Summary of findings\ table using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified three short‐term trials (total of 156 participants, duration five to 12 weeks). Outcomes were prone to at least a moderate risk of overestimating positive effects. We found that virtual reality had little effects regarding compliance (3 RCTs, n = 156, RD loss to follow‐up 0.02 CI ‐0.08 to 0.12,  low quality evidence ), cognitive functioning (1 RCT, n = 27, MD average score on Cognistat 4.67 CI ‐1.76 to 11.10,  low quality evidence ), social skills (1 RCT, n = 64, MD average score on social problem solving SPSI‐R (Social Problem Solving Inventory ‐ Revised) ‐2.30 CI ‐8.13 to 3.53,  low quality evidence ), or acceptability of intervention (2 RCTs, n = 92, RD 0.05 CI ‐0.09 to 0.19,  low quality evidence ). There were no data reported on mental state, insight, behaviour, quality of life, costs, service utilisation, or adverse effects. Satisfaction with treatment ‐ measured using an un‐referenced scale ‐ and reported as ""interest in training"" was better for the virtual reality group (1 RCT, n = 64, MD 6.00 CI 1.39 to 10.61, low quality evidence ). Authors\ conclusions There is no clear good quality evidence for or against using virtual reality for treatment compliance among people with serious mental illness. If virtual reality is used, the experimental nature of the intervention should be clearly explained. High‐quality studies should be undertaken in this area to explore any effects of this novel intervention and variations of approach. Plain language summary Virtual reality needs to be explored to show its effects for treatment of schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often have problems in their processes of thinking and understanding, resulting in poor insight into their illness and poor organisational skills. These factors along with experiencing unpleasant side effects of medication can contribute to people with mental health problems often not taking their medication, unwilling to follow treatment and non‐attendance at appointments. This can sometimes lead to a loss of contact with the mental health team and relapse. Virtual reality (VR) is a modern, experimental, computerised and real‐time technology that uses visual graphics, sounds and other sensory input which creates an interactive computer world. It includes, for example, the use of sensors attached to the hands and fingers allowing virtual reality users to track their position and movement. Virtual reality creates a computerised environment that simulates real life and everyday activities.This could help people learn in a safe and friendly environment to improve their decisions and attitudes about treatment, so encouraging people to take or comply with their medication.   So far, virtual reality has been used in the assessment and treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders and social anxieties, some of which include, fear of flying, public speaking anxiety, spider phobia, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. There are also a few studies that examine the emotional responses of people with schizophrenia during a computer simulation with characters displaying happy, neutral, and angry emotions. Virtual reality has also been used for people with schizophrenia in social skills training and to improve processes of thinking and understanding. This review investigates the effects of virtual reality in helping support the treatment and taking of medication for people with serious mental illness.  The most recent search for randomised trials was run in September 2013, only three short studies with a total of 156 people could be included. People with schizophrenia were randomised to a) skills training sessions that used virtual reality to deliver the training or b) sessions of skills training using other methods to deliver the training or c) standard care. All evidence from the trials was low quality and no real effects were found. At present, there is no clear evidence for or against using virtual reality for encouraging people with mental illness to take their medication. If virtual reality is used for people with serious mental illness, it will be of an experimental nature.There is a need to gather more good quality information on the effects of virtual reality for people with mental illness and high quality studies need to be undertaken. At this stage, the effects of virtual reality are experimental, novel and innovative but largely untested. This summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray of RETHINK."

Although used in human treatment for over twenty years, it has not been approved by any regulatory body for the treatment of cognitive impairment. Basic sciences studies have been used to claim a variety of potentially important effects in the brain. However, despite these many proposed mechanisms and targets, the relevance of this basic science to clinical studies is unclear. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of vinpocetine in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment due to vascular disease, Alzheimer\s disease, mixed (vascular and Alzheimer\s disease) and other dementias. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group\s Specialized Register was searched on 23 March 2009 using the terms vinpocetin*, cavinton, kavinton, Rgh‐4405, Tcv‐3B, ""ethyl apovincaminate"", vinRx, periwinkle, ""myrtle vincapervinc"" and cezayirmeneksesi. This register contains up to date references from major health care databases like MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as records from trials databases in the field of dementia.The manufacturers of vinpocetine were asked for information on trials of vinpocetine for dementia. In addition we tried to collect articles not listed in MEDLINE or other sources on the Internet (e.g. articles in Hungarian and Romanian). Selection criteria All human, unconfounded, double‐blind, randomized trials in which treatment with vinpocetine was administered for more than a day and compared to control in patients with vascular dementia, Alzheimer\s dementia or mixed Alzheimer\s and vascular dementia and other dementias. Non‐randomized trials were excluded. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by the two reviewers (SzSz and PW) and cross‐checked. Data from ""washout"" periods were not used for the analysis. For continuous or ordinal variables, such as cognitive test results, the main outcomes of interest were the change in score from baseline. The categorical outcome of global impression was transformed to binary data (improved or not improved) as was the occurrence of adverse effects; here the endpoint itself was of interest and the Peto method of the ""typical odds ratio"" was used. A test for heterogeneity of treatment effects between the trials was made if appropriate. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan version 4.1). Main results All identified studies were performed before and in the early 1990s and used various terms and criteria for cognitive decline and dementia. The three studies included in the review involved a total of 583 people with dementia treated with vinpocetine or placebo. The reports of these studies did not make possible any differentiation of effects for degenerative or vascular dementia. The results show benefit associated with treatment with vinpocetine 30 mg/day and 60 mg/day compared with placebo, but the number of patients treated for six months or more was small. Only one study extended treatment to one year. Adverse effects were inconsistently reported and without regard for relationship to dose. The available data do not demonstrate many problems of adverse effects but intention‐to‐treat data were not available for any of the trials. Authors\ conclusions Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use. The drug seems to have few adverse effects at the doses used in the studies. Large studies evaluating the use of vinpocetine for people suffering from well defined types of cognitive impairment are needed to explore possible efficacy of this treatment. Plain language summary Insufficient evidence of benefits of vinpocetine for people with dementia Preclinical data of uneven quality suggest a potential beneficial effect of vinpocetine in chronic cerebrovascular diseases and on cognitive performance in a variety of animal models. Clinical trials to test these hypotheses were performed before currently used criteria for dementia had become generally accepted. The results show improvement after the treatment with vinpocetine versus placebo, but the number of demented patients treated for at least six months was small. The available data does not demonstrate many side effect problems. Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use."

Twenty‐four hour residential rehabilitation (a \ward‐in‐a‐house\) is one model of care that has evolved in association with psychiatric hospital closure programmes. Objectives To determine the effects of 24 hour residential rehabilitation compared with standard treatment within a hospital setting. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2002 and February 2004). Selection criteria We included all randomised or quasi‐randomised trials that compared 24 hour residential rehabilitation with standard care for people with severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted. Data were excluded where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow‐up. For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk and its 95% confidence interval. Main results We identified and included one study with 22 participants with important methodological shortcomings and limitations of reporting. The two‐year controlled study evaluated ""new long stay patients"" in a hostel ward in the UK. One outcome \unable to manage in the placement\ provided usable data (n=22, RR 7.0 CI 0.4 to 121.4). The trial reported that hostel ward residents developed superior domestic skills, used more facilities in the community and were more likely to engage in constructive activities than those in hospital ‐ although usable numerical data were not reported. These potential advantages were not purchased at a price. The limited economic data was not good but the cost of providing 24 hour care did not seem clearly different from the standard care provided by the hospital ‐ and it may have been less. Authors\ conclusions From the single, small and ill‐reported, included study, the hostel ward type of facility appeared cheaper and positively effective. Currently, the value of this way of supporting people ‐ which could be considerable ‐ is unclear. Trials are needed. Any 24 hour care \ward‐in‐a‐house\ is likely to be oversubscribed. We argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. With follow‐up of all eligible for the placements ‐ those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care ‐ real‐world evaluation could take place. In the UK further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. The broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches. Plain language summary Twenty‐four hour care for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a long‐term, chronic, illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. It has a high disability rate and the cost to individuals, their carers and health services is substantial. Although the majority of people with schizophrenia learn to cope in the community, there are some people who need help and reminders if they are to manage self‐care and other aspects of day‐to‐day living. In many countries these people end up as long stay patients on hospital wards. This review aims to look at the economic costs and quality of life of people in 24 hour non‐hospital care compared to those still in hospital. Only one trial of 22 people and lasting two years was identified, and it took place in the UK. Most of the participants but not all had schizophrenia. Half were assigned to live in a house staffed by a psychologist, and enough nurses and nursing assistants to provide 24 hour care. The staff were expected to help prepare and share meals with the residents and the residents had a programme of domestic work and some self‐care tasks. The psychologist worked with each individual to improve social interaction and behaviour. The control group had normal hospital care with access to occupational therapy, industrial therapy and recreational facilities. They were also allowed home on leave and were counted as part of the group if they were discharged, transferred to hostels or in prison. The majority of the data were difficult to interpret because the numbers needed to make statistical comparisons were not given. Three people from the house had to be readmitted to the hospital and several of the others had short stays there. Those people who were resident in the house were reported to be significantly more likely to use social facilities and spent more time in socially constructive activities (self‐care, eating with the group). All other measures reported were not significantly different between the groups. The costs for each group were similar, however if cost was calculated for those in the house who did not use the hospital at all, it was slightly less expensive. This was a small study which was not designed well. A larger, well‐designed trial would answer the question of whether 24 hour care would benefit this group of people.

Objectives To determine absolute effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared with placebo. To critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the resource use, cost and economic evaluation of trifluoperazine compared with placebo for schizophrenia. Search methods Searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register of trials (July 2012), supplemented with handsearching, reference searching, personal communication and contact with industry. Two review authors undertook a search for economic studies using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on the 9th April 2013. Selection criteria All available clinical randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses that compare trifluoperazine with placebo. Data collection and analysis Studies for the effects of interventions were reliably selected by a review team and data were doubly independently extracted to reduce bias. We only used dichotomous data, using intention‐to‐treat analysis when possible. Data were estimated using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A Summary of findings table was produced, where possible, for each primary outcome using GRADE. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by review authors (VF and SS) to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already‐included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary. Main results This review included 10 studies with a total number of 686 participants featuring in 20 different outcomes of interest. Overall, there was significant clinical improvement in clinical global state at medium term amongst people receiving trifluoperazine (3 RCTs, n = 417, RR 4.61, CI 1.54 to 13.84,  low quality evidence ) and significantly fewer people receiving trifluoperazine left the studies early due to relapse or worsening at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 381, RR 0.34, CI 0.23 to 0.49,  low quality evidence ). However, results were equivocal for leaving the study early at medium term for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 0.80, CI 0.17 to 3.81,  very low quality evidence ) and due to severe adverse effects (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 1.54, CI 0.56 to 4.24,  very low quality evidence ). Equivocal data were also found for intensified symptoms at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 80, RR 1.05, CI 0.54 to 2.05,  very low quality evidence ) and rates of agitation or distress again at medium term (1 RCT, n = 52, RR 2.00, CI 0.19 to 20.72,  very low quality evidence ). Comparison between low and high‐dose trifluoperazine with placebo from a single study provided equivocal evidence of effects. For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes in GBP terms and presented them in additional tables; there was an estimated saving of £3488.3 in favour of trifluoperazine. However, numerous assumptions were made and these savings need to be interpreted in light of those assumptions. Authors conclusions Our results agree with existing evidence that compared to placebo, trifluoperazine is an effective antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. Furthermore, our review provides supportive evidence that trifluoperazine increases the risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Although the effect sizes against placebo are similar to those observed with other agents, they are based on data from many small, pre‐CONSORT trials with generally either a  low  or  very low GRADE evidence  that has limited implication for clinical practice. Large, independent trials are needed that adhere to the CONSORT statement to compare trifluoperazine with placebo used in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Plain language summary Trifluoperazine versus placebo for schizophrenia Trifluoperazine (trade name Stelazine) is a long‐established antipsychotic drug that has been used since the 1950s to treat schizophrenia. It is one of the first generation (typical) drugs that have proven very effective for treating the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. These drugs may cause side effects such as involuntary shaking, restlessness and movement disorders such as having a strange posture. There are also more modern drugs (second generation and atypical antipsychotic drugs). These are effective with the ‘positive symptoms’ of mental illness but also help treat ‘negative symptoms’ such as apathy, weight gain and loss of emotion in people with schizophrenia. These more modern drugs are much more expensive. This review is based on a search for trials carried out in July 2012, and includes 10 studies with 686 participants. The aim was to determine the effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia when compared with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment). As expected, people given trifluoperazine showed a significant improvement compared to placebo in both the short and medium term, reinforcing the use of this well‐established typical antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. However, trifluoperazine can cause side effects such as confusion, agitation, having a dry mouth and blurred vision, but causes less sedation and dizzy spells, so is generally well tolerated by people with schizophrenia. The authors of the review conclude that trifluoperazine has similar effectiveness to other common antipsychotic drugs, although it may cause more side effects. Evidence used in the review was also graded as low or very low quality. In the light of this, use of other antipsychotic drugs should be considered before starting on trifluoperazine. Most of the included studies were conducted roughly 40 years ago so new, large, comprehensive and independent research trials are needed.

Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between any other antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Objectives To review the effects in response to treatment of trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (November 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing trifluoperazine with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported.\u2028 \u2028 Trifluoperazine was not significantly different from low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low‐potency drug 27%, 3 RCTs, n = 120, RR 0.96 CI 0.59 to 1.56,  moderate quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (trifluoperazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 16%, 3 RCTs, n = 239, RR 1.25, CI 0.72 to 2.17, low quality evidence ). There was no significant difference in numbers with at least one adverse effect (trifluoperazine 60%, low‐potency antipsychotics 38%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.60, CI 0.94 to 2.74,  moderate quality evidence ). However, at least one movement disorder was significantly more frequent in the trifluoperazine group (trifluoperazine 23%, low‐potency antipsychotics 13%, 2 RCTs, n = 123, RR 2.08 CI 0.78 to 5.55,  very low quality evidence ) as well as incoordination (trifluoperazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 5%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 7.00, CI 1.60 to 30.66) and rigor (trifluoperazine 45%, low‐potency antipsychotics 10%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 4.50, CI 1.58 to 12.84). No data were available for other outcomes of interest death, sedation and quality of life. Authors conclusions The results did not show a difference in efficacy between trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Trifluoperazine produced more movement disorders. The number of randomised studies as well as their quality is low, the quality of evidence for outcomes of interest ranged from moderate to very low quality, so more, newer studies would be needed for conclusions about the relative effects of trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Trifluoperazine versus low‐potency first‐generation drugs for schizophrenia Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high‐potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side‐effects. The classification into high‐potency and low‐potency medication means that low‐potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side‐effects that are common to most high‐potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low‐potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high‐potency drugs with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high‐potency antipsychotic) with low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low‐potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine. The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people. It compared trifluoperazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality. Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low‐potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things. They differ slightly in their side‐effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low‐potency antipsychotics was found. Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution.

Antipsychotic medications are frequently used and there is growing interest in a potential role for psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the treatment of delusional disorder. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of medication (antipsychotic medication, antidepressants, mood stabilisers) and psychotherapy, in comparison with placebo in delusional disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (28 February 2012). Selection criteria Relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating treatments in delusional disorder. Data collection and analysis All review authors extracted data independently for the one eligible trial. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis with a fixed‐effect model. Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again with a fixed‐effect model. We assessed the risk of bias of the included study and used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results Only one randomised trial met our inclusion criteria, despite our initial search yielding 141 citations. This was a small study, with 17 people completing a trial comparing CBT to an attention placebo (supportive psychotherapy) for people with delusional disorder. Most participants were already taking medication  and this was continued during the trial . We were not able to include any randomised trials on medications of any type due to poor data reporting, which left us with no usable data for these trials. For the included study, usable data were limited, risk of bias varied and the numbers involved were small, making interpretation of data difficult. In particular there were no data on outcomes such as global state and behaviour, nor any information on possible adverse effects. A positive effect for CBT was found for social self esteem using the Social Self‐Esteem Inventory (1 RCT, n = 17, MD 30.5, CI 7.51 to 53.49,  very low quality evidence ), however this is only a measure of self worth in social situations and may thus not be well correlated to social function. More people left the study early if they were in the supportive psychotherapy group with 6/12 leaving early compared to 1/6 from the CBT group, but the difference was not significant (1 RCT, n = 17, RR 0.17, CI 0.02 to 1.18,  moderate quality evidence ). For mental state outcomes the results were skewed making interpretation difficult, especially given the small sample. Authors conclusions Despite international recognition of this disorder in psychiatric classification systems such as ICD‐10 and DSM‐5, there is a paucity of  high quality  randomised trials on delusional disorder. There is currently insufficient evidence to make evidence‐based recommendations for treatments of any type for people with delusional disorder. The limited evidence that we found is not generalisable to the population of people with delusional disorder. Until further evidence is found, it seems reasonable to offer treatments which have efficacy in other psychotic disorders. Further research is needed in this area and could be enhanced in two ways"""

The commonest clinical application of TENS is pain control. TENS is also used occasionally for the treatment of a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions including drug and alcohol dependence, headaches, and depression. TENS is rarely used for the treatment of dementia.

Studies have indicated that early symptoms that are idiosyncratic to the person with schizophrenia (early warning signs) often precede acute psychotic relapse. Early warning signs interventions propose that learning to detect and manage early warning signs of impending relapse might prevent or delay acute psychotic relapse. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual involving and not involving a psychological therapy on time to relapse, hospitalisation, functioning, negative and positive symptomatology. Search methods Search databases included the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007 and May 2012) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were reviewed for inclusion. We inspected the UK National Research Registe and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual for people with schizophrenia or other non‐affective psychosis Data collection and analysis We assessed included studies for quality and extracted data. If more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up, the study was excluded. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD) with standard errors estimated, and for time to event outcomes we calculated Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and associated 95 % CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and assessed overall study quality using the GRADE approach. Main results Thirty‐two RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs that randomised 3554 people satisfied criteria for inclusion. Only one study examined the effects of early warning signs interventions without additional psychological interventions, and many of the outcomes for this review were not reported or poorly‐reported. Significantly fewer people relapsed with early warning signs interventions than with usual care (23% versus 43%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79; 15 RCTs, 1502 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to relapse did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs, 550 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Risk of re‐hospitalisation was significantly lower with early warning signs interventions compared to usual care (19% versus 39%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; 15 RCTS, 1457 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Time to re‐hospitalisation did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs; 1149 participants;  very low quality evidence ). Participants satisfaction with care and economic costs were inconclusive because of a lack of evidence. Authors conclusions This review indicates that early warning signs interventions may have a positive effect on the proportions of people re‐hospitalised and on rates of relapse, but not on time to recurrence. However, the overall quality of the evidence was very low, indicating that we do not know if early warning signs interventions will have similar effects outside trials and that it is very likely that further research will alter these estimates. Moreover, the early warning signs interventions were used along side other psychological interventions, and we do not know if they would be effective on their own. They may be cost‐effective due to reduced hospitalisation and relapse rates, but before mental health services consider routinely providing psychological interventions involving the early recognition and prompt management of early warning signs to adults with schizophrenia, further research is required to provide evidence of high or moderate quality regarding the efficacy of early warning signs interventions added to usual care without additional psychological interventions, or to clarify the kinds of additional psychological interventions that might aid its efficacy. Future RCTs should be adequately‐powered, and designed to minimise the risk of bias and be transparently reported. They should also systematically evaluate resource costs and resource use, alongside efficacy outcomes and other outcomes that are important to people with serious mental illness and their carers. Plain language summary Training to recognise the early signs of recurrence in schizophrenia Many people with schizophrenia experience periods of illness followed by relatively stable periods (although symptoms of illness such as hearing voices and seeing things often remain in the background). This means that many people with schizophrenia may become unwell again and need to go back into hospital. Training in early warning signs techniques encourages people to learn, detect and recognise the early warning signs of future illness. Studies indicate that noticing even small changes in signs and symptoms of schizophrenia can often predict future illness and relapse two to 10 weeks later. Early warning training may help to prevent or delay relapse, so reducing the chances of going into hospital. Recognition of early warning signs requires detailed history taking, sometimes with additional techniques such as diary keeping, completion of questionnaires and a plan of action based on anticipated early warning signs. Training can be undertaken by the individual or be group‐based, involving health professionals, family members or carers. Successful training seems to require around 12 sessions and involves therapists of high competency. \u2028 \u2028 This review includes a total of 34 studies. It found that there are positive benefits of training in early warning signs. It reduces rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation (but not on time to recurrence). It should be noted that training in early warning signs was mainly used alongside other psychological therapies, so it is not entirely clear what proportion of the positive effect is due to training in early warning signs alone. Moreover, the overall quality of the evidence from these studies was judged to be very low. This means that we do not know if interventions using early warning signs, with or without additional psychological treatments, will have the same beneficial effects outside clinical trials. \u2028 \u2028 Further research is required to decide whether training in early warning signs is effective on its own. Effects on quality of life, satisfaction with care, money spent, and burden of care for carers are unclear, so ideally should be known before training programmes are put into wider use. At this time, there is not enough evidence to support training in early warning signs alone. This plain language summary was written by consumer, Ben Gray of RETHINK."""

Many people have difficulty accessing treatment, due to a variety of obstacles. Researchers have therefore explored the possibility of using the Internet to deliver CBT; it is important to ensure the decision to promote such treatment is grounded in high quality evidence. Objectives To assess the effects of therapist‐supported Internet CBT (ICBT) on remission of anxiety disorder diagnosis and reduction of anxiety symptoms in adults as compared to waiting list control, unguided CBT, or face‐to‐face CBT. Effects of treatment on quality of life and patient satisfaction with the intervention were also assessed. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 16 March 2015. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL. We also searched online clinical trial registries and reference lists of included studies. We contacted authors to locate additional trials. Selection criteria Each identified study was independently assessed for inclusion by two authors. To be included, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of therapist‐supported ICBT compared to a waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group; unguided CBT (that is, self‐help); or face‐to‐face CBT. We included studies that treated adults with an anxiety disorder (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, post‐traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and specific phobia) defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, III‐R, IV, IV‐TR or the International Classification of Disesases 9 or 10. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and judged overall study quality. We used data from intention‐to‐treat analyses wherever possible. We assessed treatment effect for the dichotomous outcome of clinically important improvement in anxiety using a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For disorder‐specific and general anxiety symptom measures and quality of life we assessed continuous scores using standardized mean differences (SMD). We examined statistical heterogeneity using the I 2  statistic. Main results We screened 1736 citations and selected 38 studies (3214 participants) for inclusion. The studies examined social phobia (11 trials), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (8 trials), generalized anxiety disorder (5 trials), post‐traumatic stress disorder (2 trials), obsessive compulsive disorder (2 trials), and specific phobia (2 trials). Eight remaining studies included a range of anxiety disorder diagnoses. Studies were conducted in Sweden (18 trials), Australia (14 trials), Switzerland (3 trials), the Netherlands (2 trials), and the USA (1 trial) and investigated a variety of ICBT protocols. Three primary comparisons were identified, therapist‐supported ICBT versus waiting list control, therapist‐supported versus unguided ICBT, and therapist‐supported ICBT versus face‐to‐face CBT. Low quality evidence from 11 studies (866 participants) contributed to a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 3.75 (95% CI 2.51 to 5.60; I 2  = 50%) for clinically important improvement in anxiety at post‐treatment, favouring therapist‐supported ICBT over a waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group only. The SMD for disorder‐specific symptoms at post‐treatment (28 studies, 2147 participants; SMD ‐1.06, 95% CI ‐1.29 to ‐0.82; I 2  = 83%) and general anxiety symptoms at post‐treatment (19 studies, 1496 participants; SMD ‐0.75, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.52; I 2  = 78%) favoured therapist‐supported ICBT; the quality of the evidence for both outcomes was low. One study compared unguided CBT to therapist‐supported ICBT for clinically important improvement in anxiety at post‐treatment, showing no difference in outcome between treatments (54 participants; very low quality evidence). At post‐treatment there were no clear differences between unguided CBT and therapist‐supported ICBT for disorder‐specific anxiety symptoms (5 studies, 312 participants; SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.56 to 0.13; I 2  = 58%; very low quality evidence) or general anxiety symptoms (2 studies, 138 participants; SMD 0.28, 95% CI ‐2.21 to 2.78; I 2  = 0%; very low quality evidence). Compared to face‐to‐face CBT, therapist‐supported ICBT showed no significant differences in clinically important improvement in anxiety at post‐treatment (4 studies, 365 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34; I 2  = 0%; low quality evidence). There were also no clear differences between face‐to‐face and therapist supported ICBT for disorder‐specific anxiety symptoms at post‐treatment (7 studies, 450 participants; SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.25 to 0.37; I 2  = 60%; low quality evidence) or general anxiety symptoms at post‐treatment (5 studies, 317 participants; SMD 0.17, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.69; I 2  = 78%; low quality evidence). Overall, risk of bias in included studies was low or unclear for most domains. However, due to the nature of psychosocial intervention trials, blinding of participants and personnel, and outcome assessment tended to have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity across a number of the meta‐analyses was substantial, some was explained by type of anxiety disorder or may be meta‐analytic measurement artefact due to combining many assessment measures. Adverse events were rarely reported. Authors conclusions Therapist‐supported ICBT appears to be an efficacious treatment for anxiety in adults. The evidence comparing therapist‐supported ICBT to waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group only control was low to moderate quality, the evidence comparing therapist‐supported ICBT to unguided ICBT was very low quality, and comparisons of therapist‐supported ICBT to face‐to‐face CBT were low quality. Further research is needed to better define and measure any potential harms resulting from treatment. These findings suggest that therapist‐supported ICBT is more efficacious than a waiting list, attention, information, or online discussion group only control, and that there may not be a significant difference in outcome between unguided CBT and therapist‐supported ICBT; however, this latter finding must be interpreted with caution due to imprecision. The evidence suggests that therapist‐supported ICBT may not be significantly different from face‐to‐face CBT in reducing anxiety. Future research should explore heterogeneity among studies which is reducing the quality of the evidence body, involve equivalence trials comparing ICBT and face‐to‐face CBT, examine the importance of the role of the therapist in ICBT, and include effectiveness trials of ICBT in real‐world settings. A timely update to this review is needed given the fast pace of this area of research.

Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register of trials (November 2012). Selection criteria All randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and comparing supportive therapy with any other treatment or standard care. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality rated these and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated the risk ratio (RR) using a fixed‐effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we undertook intention‐to‐treat analyses. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) fixed‐effect with 95% CIs. We estimated heterogeneity (I 2  technique) and publication bias. We used GRADE to rate quality of evidence. Main results Four new trials were added after the 2012 search. The review now includes 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants. Overall, the evidence was  very low quality . We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatments over supportive therapy. These included hospitalisation rates (4 RCTs, n = 306, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.99,  very low quality of evidence ), clinical improvement in mental state (3 RCTs, n = 194, RR 1.27 CI 1.04 to 1.54,  very low quality of evidence ) and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care (1 RCT, n = 45, RR 3.19 CI 1.01 to 10.7,  very low quality of evidence ). For this comparison, we found no evidence of significant differences for rate of relapse, leaving the study early and quality of life. When we compared supportive therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy CBT), we again found no significant differences in primary outcomes. There were very limited data to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation, and no studies provided data regarding clinically important change in general functioning, one of our primary outcomes of interest. Authors conclusions There are insufficient data to identify a difference in outcome between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy but these findings are based on a few small studies where we graded the evidence as  very low quality . Future research would benefit from larger trials that use supportive therapy as the main treatment arm rather than the comparator. Plain language summary Supportive therapy for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with ‘positive symptoms’ such as hallucinations (hearing voices and seeing things) and delusions (having strange beliefs). People with schizophrenia also suffer from disorganisation and ‘negative symptoms’ (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). People with schizophrenia may find it hard to socialise and find employment. Schizophrenia is considered one of the most burdensome illnesses in the world. For some people it can be a lifelong condition. Most people with schizophrenia will be given antipsychotic medications to help relieve the symptoms. In addition to this they can also receive therapy, of which there are various types.\u2028 \u2028 One therapy often given to people with schizophrenia is supportive therapy, where typically after a person is established in the care of mental health services, they will receive general support rather than specific talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). For example, in consultations with health professionals there will often be time given to listening to people’s concerns, providing encouragement, or even arranging basic help with daily living. Many people with schizophrenia also receive support from their family and friends. Supportive therapy has been described as the treatment of choice for most people with mental illness and may be one of the most commonly practiced therapies in mental health services. It is, however, difficult to answer the question of exactly what supportive therapy is. It is difficult to find a widely accepted definition of supportive therapy. For the purposes of this review, supportive therapy includes any intervention from a single person aimed at maintaining a person’s existing situation or assisting in people’s coping abilities. This includes interventions that require a trained therapist, such as supportive psychotherapy, as well as other interventions that require no training, such as befriending. Supportive therapy does not include interventions that seek to educate, train or change a person’s way of coping. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of supportive therapy compared to other specific therapies or treatment as usual. This update is based on a search run in 2012; the review now includes 24 randomised studies with a total of 2126 people. The studies compared supportive therapy either with standard care alone or a range of other therapies such as CBT, family therapy and psychoeducation. The participants continued to receive their antipsychotic medication and any other treatment they would normally receive during the trials. Overall, the quality of evidence from these studies was very low. There is not enough information or data to identify any real therapeutic difference between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation, satisfaction with treatment and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy. However, these findings are limited because they are based on only a few small studies where the quality of evidence is very low. There was very limited information to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation as most studies in this review focused on other psychological therapies, such as CBT. Apart from one study presenting data on death, there was no information on the adverse effects of supportive therapy. In summary, there does not seem to be much difference between supportive therapy, standard care and other therapies. Future research would benefit from larger studies where supportive therapy is the main treatment. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation"""

Objectives To evaluate the effects of sulpiride augmentation versus monotherapy for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2009) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a fixed‐effect model. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed‐effect model. Main results We included three short‐term and one long‐term trial (total N=221). All participants had schizophrenia that was either treatment‐resistant or with prominent negative symptoms. All studies compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine (+/‐ placebo), were small and at considerable risk of bias. Short‐term data of no clinically significant response in global state tended to favour sulpiride augmentation of clozapine compared with clozapine alone (n=193, 3 RCTs, RR 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.09). People allocated to sulpiride plus clozapine had more movement disorders (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 48.24 CI 3.05 to 762.56) and an increase in serum prolactin (skewed data, 1 RCT), but less incidence of hypersalivation (n=162, 3 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.29 to 0.83) and less weight gain (n=64, 1 RCT, RR 0.30 CI 0.09 to 0.99). The augmentation of clozapine by sulpiride also caused less appetite loss (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.70, NNT 4 CI 4 to 12, Z=2.31, P=0.02) and less abdominal distension (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.10 CI 0.01 to 0.78, NNT 5 CI 4 to 19, Z=2.20, P=0.03). Long‐term data showed no significant difference in global state (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.42 to 1.08) and relapse (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.85 CI 0.5 to 1.3). Authors conclusions Sulpiride plus clozapine is probably more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people whose illness has been resistant to other antipsychotic drugs including clozapine. However, much more robust data are needed. Plain language summary The efficacy of sulpiride augmentation for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic illness in which psychotic symptoms are prominent. The psychotic symptoms are often managed with drugs. Not all people with schizophrenia respond well to treatment with antipsychotic drugs and sulpiride is often used as an add‐on drug for promoting the efficacy of another medication. Several clinical trials reported effects of sulpiride augmentation for management of schizophrenia. We included four small trials which compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine alone for very ill people. Evidence from the present review suggested that short‐term sulpiride plus clozapine probably is more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people. The evidence is, however, weak and prone to considerable bias. This is a good area for more research."""

Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimers disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. Selection criteria We included double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow‐up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta‐analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non‐fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). Authors conclusions There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only. Plain language summary Statins for the prevention of dementia Background Dementia (including Alzheimers disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and that treatment with cholesterol‐lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia. Study characteristics We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimers disease. Key results We found two suitable randomised trials for inclusion in this review with 26,340 participants; neither showed any reduction in occurrence of Alzheimers disease or dementia in people treated with statins compared to people given placebo. Side effects were low in both statin and placebo groups with no difference between groups in the risk of dropping out of the trial due to side effects. Quality of the evidence There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia."""

Special Care Units (SCUs) have flourished since the 1980s with the aim of taking care of dementia patients, usually those with Alzheimers disease, and in particular for those with behavioural problems. Although lacking a standard definition, SCUs are usually situated within nursing homes and commonly include the features of trained staffing, special programming, a modified physical environment, and family involvement. The costs of SCUs are commonly higher than for standard nursing home care. However, evaluations of the outcomes of SCUs have yielded conflicting results.

The rationale for this lies in the proposition that the provision of a sensory environment for people with dementia places fewer demands on their intellectual abilities but capitalizes on their residual sensorimotor abilities. The clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make the examination of the therapeutic values of snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions.

This may be due to a wide range of factors that could include a common aetiology to both smoking and the illness, self medication, smoking to alleviate adverse effects of medications, boredom in the existing environment, or a combination of these factors. It is important to undertake this review to facilitate improvements in both the health and safety of people with serious mental illness who smoke, and to reduce the overall burden of costs (both financial and health) to the smoker and, eventually, to the taxpayer. Objectives To review the effects of smoking cessation advice for people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialized Trials Register up to 2 April 2015, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and trial registries. We also undertook unsystematic searches of a sample of the component databases (BNI, CINHAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO), up to 2 April 2015, and searched references of all identified studies Selection criteria We planned to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that focussed on smoking cessation advice versus standard care or comparing smoking cessation advice with other more focussed methods of delivering care or information. Data collection and analysis The review authors (PK, AC, and DB) independently screened search results but did not identify any trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. Main results We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated advice regarding smoking cessation for people with serious mental illness. The excluded studies illustrate that randomisation of packages of care relevant to smokers with serious mental illness is possible. Authors conclusions People with serious mental illness are more likely to smoke than the general population. Yet we could not find any high quality evidence to guide the smoking cessation advice healthcare professionals pass onto service users. This is an area where trials are possible and needed. Plain language summary Specialised advice on stopping smoking for people with serious mental illness Review question Does specialised advice about the benefits of stopping smoking work for people with a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia? Background People with serious mental health problems are more likely to smoke and to smoke more heavily than the general population. Around 60% to 70% of people with schizophrenia smoke, whereas around 20% of the general population smoke. People with mental illness may smoke more due to a range of factors. There may be a direct causal link between mental illness and smoking or it may be that smoking helps people deal with the stress of mental illness, or helps with the side effects of medication, such as tiredness, drowsiness, and boredom, or both. However, smoking is very bad for people’s physical health in general and can lead to serious diseases such as cancer. The provision of specific advice from health professionals may help people with serious mental illness to stop smoking. Study characteristics The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials up to 2 April 2015 that investigated the effects of providing advice about the effects of smoking and the effects of stopping smoking to people with serious mental illness compared to no advice about stopping smoking.No trials that met the inclusion criteria of this review were found.. Key results Currently there is no high quality evidence from randomised trials to guide healthcare professionals about how effective giving advice is to help people stop smoking. It is therefore unclear if advice has any effect on helping people with serious mental illness stop smoking. Quality of the evidence Good quality Evidence relevant to smokers with serious mental illness is much needed, important. It is possible if a large, high quality trial is undertaken and gathers relevant, high quality evidence on advice to help people stop smoking.

Early published meta‐analyses of STPP, using different methods and samples, have yielded conflicting results, although some meta‐analyses have consistently supported an empirical basis for STPP. This is an update of a review that was last updated in 2006. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of STPP for adults with common mental disorders compared with wait‐list controls, treatments as usual and minimal contact controls in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To specify the differential effects of STPP for people with different disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, mixed disorders and personality disorder) and treatment characteristics (e.g. manualised versus non‐manualised therapies). Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Groups Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) was searched to February 2014, this register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974‐), MEDLINE (1950‐) and PsycINFO (1967‐). We also conducted searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, DARE and Biological Abstracts (all years to July 2012) and all relevant studies (identified to 2012) were fully incorporated in this review update. We checked references from papers retrieved. We contacted a large group of psychodynamic researchers in an attempt to find new studies. Selection criteria We included all RCTs of adults with common mental disorders, in which a brief psychodynamic therapy lasting 40 or fewer hours in total was provided in individual format. Data collection and analysis Eight review authors working in pairs evaluated studies. We selected studies only if pairs of review authors agreed that the studies met inclusion criteria. We consulted a third review author if two review authors could not reach consensus. Two review authors collected data and entered it into Review Manager software. Two review authors assessed and scored risk of bias. We assessed publication bias using a funnel plot. Two review authors conducted and reviewed subgroup analyses. Main results We included 33 studies of STPP involving 2173 randomised participants with common mental disorders. Studies were of diverse conditions in which problems with emotional regulation were purported to play a causative role albeit through a range of symptom presentations. These studies evaluated STPP for this reviews primary outcomes (general, somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom reduction), as well as interpersonal problems and social adjustment. Except for somatic measures in the short‐term, all outcome categories suggested significantly greater improvement in the treatment versus the control groups in the short‐term and medium‐term. Effect sizes increased in long‐term follow‐up, but some of these effects did not reach statistical significance. A relatively small number of studies (N < 20) contributed data for the outcome categories. There was also significant heterogeneity between studies in most categories, possibly due to observed differences between manualised versus non‐manualised treatments, short versus longer treatments, studies with observer‐rated versus self report outcomes, and studies employing different treatment models. Authors conclusions There has been further study of STPP and it continues to show promise, with modest to large gains for a wide variety of people. However, given the limited data, loss of significance in some measures at long‐term follow‐up and heterogeneity between studies, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, variability in treatment delivery and treatment quality may limit the reliability of estimates of effect for STPP. Larger studies of higher quality and with specific diagnoses are warranted. Plain language summary Short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders Background Common mental disorders include anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, stress‐related physical conditions, certain behaviour disorders and personality disorders. People with these disorders tend to have problems handling difficult emotions and often respond with physical and psychic symptoms or avoidant behavioural patterns. Such patterns and emotional responses are theoretically treatable by short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) because these therapies aim to improve long‐ and short‐term problems with emotion processing, behaviour and communication/relationships with others. STPP is thought to work by making people aware of emotions, thoughts and problems with communication/relationships that are related to past and recent trauma. This in turn helps to correct problems with emotions and relationships with others. This review sought to find out whether STPP is more effective than wait‐list control (where people receive therapy after a delay during which people in the active group receive the therapy), treatment as usual and minimal treatment (partial treatments not expected to provide a robust effect). Study characteristics We searched scientific databases to find all published and unpublished studies of STPP compared with wait‐list control, treatment as usual or minimal treatment up to July 2012. We searched for studies in adults over 17 years of age with common mental disorders being treated in an outpatient setting. We excluded people with psychotic disorders. Key results We included 33 studies involving 2173 people. When the results of the studies were combined and analysed, we found that there was a significantly greater improvement in the groups of people who received STPP versus the control groups, both in the short‐term (less than three months after treatment) and medium‐term (three to six months after treatment). These benefits generally appeared to increase in the long‐term. However, some results did not remain statistically significant in the long‐term and, in addition, the studies varied in terms of their design, meaning that these conclusions are tentative and need confirmation with further research. The finding that a short‐term psychological therapy treatment may be broadly applicable and effective is of importance in the atmosphere of current global healthcare and economic restrictions. Quality of the evidence The studies were of variable quality."""

Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand‐searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double‐entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side‐effects). Main results A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea. Authors conclusions This systematic review and meta‐analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre‐specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians were not reported in any of the included studies. Plain language summary Sertraline versus other antidepressive agents for depression Depression is the fourth leading cause of disease burden worldwide and is expected to show a rising trend over the next 20 years. Depression is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Sertraline, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is a potent and specific inhibitor of serotonin uptake into the presynaptic terminal, with a modest activity as inhibitor of dopamine uptake. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Fifty‐nine randomised controlled trials (about 10,000 participants) were included in the review. The review showed evidence of differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability between sertraline and other antidepressants, with meta‐analyses highlighting a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressants, both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, in a homogeneous sample of clinical trials, using conservative statistical methods. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre‐specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients and their carers attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Nevertheless, based on currently available evidence, results from this review suggest that sertraline might be a strong candidate as the initial choice of antidepressant in people with acute major depression."""

Compared with relatively high doses of risperidone (between 4 and 12 mg/day), sertindole produced significantly less akathisia and parkinsonism (1 RCT, n=321, RR 0.24 CI 0.09 to 0.69, NNT 14, CI 8 to 100). Sertindole produced more cardiac effects (2 RCTs, n=508, RR QTc prolongation 4.86 CI 1.94 to 12.18), weight change (2 RCTs, n=328, WMD 0.99 CI 0.12 to 1.86) and male sexual dysfunction (2 RCTs, n=437, RR 2.90 CI 1.32 to 6.35, NNH 13 CI 8 to 33). Authors conclusions Sertindole may induce fewer movement disorders, but more cardiac effects, weight change and male sexual dysfunction than risperidone. However these data are based on only two studies and are too limited to allow firm conclusions. Nothing can be said about the effects of sertindole compared with second generation antipsychotics other than risperidone. There are several relevant trials underway or completed and about to report. Plain language summary Sertindole versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental health problem that can be long term and can severely disable some of the people who have it, especially in terms of quality of life and inclusion into wider society. The main treatment is medication (antipsychotics) and while some people find a drug which decreases their symptoms and does not give them a lot of adverse effects, there are others who are ‘treatment resistant’ i.e. none of the medication available works for them. There are some antipsychotics, such as clozapine and sertindole that can have quite dangerous side‐effects in some people. However, if they benefit people for whom nothing else works, the extra monitoring of these side‐effects that is needed, can perhaps be justified.  This review aims to compare sertindole to the other newer second generation (atypical) antipsychotics in people who have schizophrenia. Two studies were identified which included 508 people. Both compared sertindole to risperidone, were short (12 weeks) and the participants were either at least moderately ill or treatment resistant. There was no overall significant difference between these two medications in terms of improvement in people’s general well‐being or their mental state. Also while people on risperidone showed more movement side‐effects, those on sertindole were more likely to put on weight, have changes in their heart rhythm and the men were more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction.  The data from these trials are limited and a considerable number of the participants left the study early. In addition, sertindole has only been compared to one second generation antipsychotic and the trials are relatively short. A larger and longer trial comparing sertindole to other second generation antipsychotics, with the outcomes including mental state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life, would enhance our knowledge in this area considerably.

Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. Objectives To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. Main results We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. Authors conclusions Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them. Plain language summary Self management interventions for type 2 diabetes in adults with severe mental illness Review question What are the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for adults with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness? Background Diabetes is one of the most common long‐term conditions, affecting around 415 million people worldwide. People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop diabetes as those without mental health problems because of many factors, including antipsychotic medication side effects and inadequate lifestyle such as poor diet and low levels of physical activity. Once diagnosed, type 2 diabetes is managed through a combination of medication and behavioural changes. When diabetes is poorly managed, people can develop severe and life‐threatening complications. Healthcare providers have developed patient education programmes to help people to self manage their diabetes, and to reduce the likelihood of these complications. Although many programmes for type 2 diabetes have been found to be effective, little is known about programmes that have been specifically tailored to meet the needs of people with severe mental illness. Study characteristics We identified one study, which recruited 64 adults with type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers compared usual care plus information leaflets with a 24‐week education programme delivered once a week for 90 minutes (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training). This programme provided basic diabetes education and information about nutrition and exercise. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years old. People in the included study were monitored for six months after the programme ended. This evidence is up to date as of 07 March 2016. Key results In summary, few studies have evaluated the effects of diabetes self management programmes for adults with severe mental illness. Study authors of the single included study did not report diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. They described small improvements in body mass index and body weight, as well as in diabetes knowledge and self efficacy. Current evidence is insufficient to show that these types of programmes can help people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness to better manage their diabetes and its consequences. Quality of the evidence We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low, mainly because of the small numbers of included studies and participants, and because reported study results showed inconsistency."""

The positive symptoms usually respond to antipsychotics but the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are difficult to treat with conventional antipsychotics and significantly impact on quality of life and social outcomes. Selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) increase prefrontal dopamine and noradrenaline levels without significantly affecting subcortical dopamine levels, making them an attractive candidate for treating cognitive and negative symptoms. Objectives To investigate the effects of selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), compared with a placebo or control treatment, for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (up to 7 February 2017) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitation for inclusion of records into the register. We inspected references of all included studies for further relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NRIs with either a control treatment or placebo for people with schizophrenia or related disorders (such as schizoaffective disorder) by any means of diagnosis. We included trials that met our selection criteria and provided useable information. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), and for cognitive outcomes we derived standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and using a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a Summary of findings table which included our prespecified main outcomes of interest. Main results Searching identified 113 records. We obtained the full text of 48 of these records for closer inspection. Sixteen trials, randomising a total of 919 participants are included. The majority of trials included adults with schizophrenia or similar illness who were inpatients, and while they were poorly characterised, most appeared to include patients with a chronic presentation. The intervention NRI in nine of the 16 trials was reboxetine, with atomoxetine and viloxazine used in the remaining trials. 14 trials compared NRIs with placebo. Only two trials provided data to compare NRIs against an active control and both compared reboxetine to citalopram but at 4 weeks and 24 weeks respectively so they could not be combined in a meta‐analysis. One trial was described as open and we considered it to be at high risk of bias for randomisation and blinding, three trials were at high risk of bias for attrition, six for reporting, and two for other sources of bias. Our main outcomes of interest were significant response or improvement in positive/negative mental state, global state and cognitive functioning, average cognitive functioning scores, significant response or improvement in quality of life and incidence of nausea. All data for main outcomes were short term. NRIs versus placebo Mental state results showed significantly greater rates of improvement in negative symptoms scores (1 RCT, n = 50; RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.52 to 6.58; very low quality evidence) with NRIs on the PANSS negative. No data were reported for significant response or improvement in positive symptoms, but average endpoint PANSS positive scores were available and showed no difference between NRIs and placebo (5 RCTs, n = 294; MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.96 to 0.63; low‐quality evidence). Improvement in clinical global status was similar between groups (1 RCT, n = 28; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.20; very low quality evidence). Significant response or improvement in cognitive functioning data were not reported. Average composite cognitive scores showed no difference between NRIs and placebo (4 RCTs, n = 180; SMD 0.04, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.36; low‐quality evidence). Significant response or improvement in quality of life data were not reported, however average endpoint scores from the GQOLI‐74 were reported. Those receiving NRIs had better quality of life scores compared to placebo (1 RCT, n = 114; MD 9.36, 95% CI 7.89 to 10.83; very low quality evidence). All‐cause withdrawals did not differ between the treatment groups (8 RCTs, n = 401, RR 0.94 95% CI 0.63 to 1.39; moderate‐quality evidence). Rates of nausea were not greater with NRIs (3 RCTs, n = 176; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.41; low‐quality evidence). Authors conclusions Our results provide tentative very low quality evidence that compared to placebo, NRIs (specifically reboxetine) may have a benefit on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Limited evidence also suggests that NRIs have no effect on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia or cognitive functioning. NRIs appear generally well tolerated with no real differences in adverse effects such as nausea noted between NRIs and placebo. However, these results are based on short‐term follow‐up and are poor quality — there is need for more good‐quality evidence. A large RCT of reboxetine over a longer period of time, focusing specifically on negative and cognitive symptoms as well as more detailed and comprehensive reporting of outcomes, including adverse events, is required. Plain language summary Using selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) to treat schizophrenia Review question Are selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) effective for treating the symptoms, particularly the negative symptoms, of schizophrenia? Background People with schizophrenia often have positive symptoms such as hearing voices (hallucinations), bizarre beliefs (delusions), or unclear thinking (formal thought disorder). These can be treated successfully with antipsychotic medication. People with schizophrenia also have negative symptoms such as social withdrawal or lack of motivation and cognitive symptoms such as difficulties making decisions and problems with attention or memory. Negative symptoms often are long term and reduce quality of life. Unlike the positive symptoms, there is a lack of effective medications to treat these negative symptoms. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (such as reboxetine or atomoxetine) are medicines that might help with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in particular. There have been trials investigating the effectiveness of NRIs for people with schizophrenia but results found NRIs had little benefit. However, these were very small studies. We wanted to see whether combining results from all these trials would provide better‐quality evidence. Searching and study characteristics The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their specialised register for relevant trials up to February 2017. We found sixteen trials that could be included. These trials randomised 919 adults with schizophrenia to receive either an NRI, a placebo (dummy treatment), or an antidepressant. All participants continued to receive the antipsychotic medications they were already taking. Most trials included participants who were in hospital and who had had symptoms of schizophrenia for a long time. Key results and quality of the evidence available Our main areas of interest were the effect NRIs have on improving mental and global state, cognitive functioning and quality of life for people with schizophrenia; and if NRIs cause unpleasant side‐effects such as nausea. We found that compared to placebo treatment, NRIs (reboxetine in particular) have an effect on improving negative symptoms. However, we did not find evidence that NRIs have an effect on improving positive symptoms, cognitive functioning or incidence of nausea. One trial reported a benefit of reboxetine on quality of life scores. Conclusions The results of our review should be viewed with caution as the quality of evidence available is very low due to the small size of studies and poor quality of the trials. In order to make firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of NRIs for people with schizophrenia we need larger and better quality trials of NRIs. These should be long term and look particularly at negative and cognitive symptoms as well as side‐effects."""

Inadequate response occurs in 40% to 60% of people that are prescribed first line pharmaceutical treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). To date not much is known about the efficacy and adverse effects of second‐generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) in people suffering from OCD. Objectives To evaluate the effects of SGAs (monotherapy or add on) compared with placebo or other forms of pharmaceutical treatment for people with OCD. Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Groups controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched up to 21 July 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted key authors and drug companies. Selection criteria We included double‐blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral SGAs (monotherapy or add on) in adults with other forms of pharmaceutical treatment or placebo in people with primary OCD. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results We included 11 RCTs with 396 participants on three SGAs. All trials investigated the effects of adding these SGAs to antidepressants (usually SSRIs). The duration of all trials was less than six months. Only 13% of the participants left the trials early. Most trials were limited in terms of quality aspects. Two trials examined olanzapine and found no difference in the primary outcome (response to treatment) and most other efficacy‐related outcomes but it was associated with more weight gain than monotherapy with antidepressants. Quetiapine combined with antidepressants was also not any more efficacious than placebo combined with antidepressants in terms of the primary outcome, but there was a significant superiority in the mean Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y‐BOCS) score at endpoint (MD ‐2.28, 95% CI ‐4.05 to ‐0.52). There were also some beneficial effects of quetiapine in terms of anxiety or depressive symptoms. Risperidone was more efficacious than placebo in terms of the primary outcome (number of participants without a significant response) (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66) and in the reduction of anxiety and depression (MD ‐7.60, 95% CI ‐12.37 to ‐2.83).  Authors conclusions The available data of the effects of olanzapine in OCD are too limited to draw any conclusions. There is some evidence that adding quetiapine or risperidone to antidepressants increases efficacy, but this must be weighed against less tolerability and limited data. Plain language summary Second‐generation antipsychotic drugs for obsessive compulsive disorder This review found some trials comparing the effects of adding second‐generation antipsychotic drugs or placebo to antidepressants in obsessive compulsive disorder. There were only 11 trials on three second‐generation antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone).

The author team ran complementary searches on ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials (RCTs) comparing second‐generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo, benzodiazepines, pregabalin or antidepressants. Participants were people with generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and specific phobias including social phobia. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes eleven RCTs with 4144 participants on three second‐generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone). Nine studies investigated the effects of second‐generation antipsychotics in generalised anxiety disorder, only two studies investigated the effects in social phobia. There were no studies on panic disorder or any other primary anxiety disorder. Seven studies investigated the effects of quetiapine. Participants with generalised anxiety disorder responded significantly better to quetiapine than to placebo (4 RCTs, N = 2265, OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.45). However, they were more likely to drop out due to adverse events, to gain weight, to suffer from sedation or to suffer from extrapyramidal side effects. When quetiapine was compared with antidepressants, there was no significant difference in efficacy‐related outcomes, but more participants in the quetiapine groups dropped out due to adverse events, gained weight and feeling sedated. Only two very small studies with a total of 36 participants examined olanzapine and found no difference in response to treatment. Two trials compared adjunctive treatment with risperidone with placebo and found no difference in response to treatment. Authors conclusions We identified eligible trials on quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine. The available data on olanzapine and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions. Monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants.

We found eleven randomised placebo‐controlled trials, comparing quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone with placebo and antidepressants. The vast majority of the available data was on quetiapine (> 3000 participants). Participants with generalised anxiety disorder responded significantly better to quetiapine than to placebo, measured as a reduction in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A).

The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review ‐ one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD ‐ focuses on second‐generation antidepressants (SGAs). Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non‐randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random‐effects (Mantel‐Haenszel) meta‐analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi 2  statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I 2  statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots.We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. Main results We identified 3745 citations after de‐duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate‐quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low‐quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors conclusions Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high‐risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. Plain language summary Antidepressants for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? • Anyone who has experienced winter depression. • Relatives and friends of people who have experienced winter depression. • General practitioners, psychiatrists and pharmacists. • Professionals working in adult mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning antidepressant therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms can prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of antidepressants when they are used in healthy people with a history of winter depression to prevent onset of depression the next winter. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on antidepressants given to prevent winter depression. Of 3745 records, we found three randomised controlled studies including 1100 people who received bupropion extended‐release (only one of many available antidepressants, but the only one licensed for prevention of winter depression) or placebo. We found no studies on other antidepressants. What does evidence from the review reveal? In populations with a high risk of developing a new depressive episode in the next winter, results show that antidepressants can prevent winter depression in about one in four people. In populations with a lower risk of recurrence, antidepressants can prevent a new depressive episode in one of eight people. The other seven people suffer from winter depression despite treatment or would not have suffered from winter depression anyway. People using antidepressants are at slightly higher risk of experiencing headaches, nausea or insomnia when compared with people not taking antidepressants. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of antidepressants and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as light treatment, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, the decision for or against preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare antidepressants against other treatments, such as light therapy, psychological therapies or other drugs to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression."""

Acetylcholine is a chemical found in the brain that has an important role in memory, attention, reason and language. Rivastigmine is a “pseudo‐irreversible” inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which is thought to maintain levels of acetylcholine. Rivastigmine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of rivastigmine as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials.

As well as its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders than the older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms. Objectives To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to conventional neuroleptic drugs. Search methods The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980‐1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980‐1997), MEDLINE (1966‐1997), PsycLIT (1974‐1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted. Selection criteria All randomised trials comparing risperidone to any conventional neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on dose of risperidone, haloperidol and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement, side effects (movement disorders) and acceptability of treatment. For homogeneous dichotomous data the Relative Risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Main results In the short‐term, risperidone was more likely to produce an improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) when compared with haloperidol (n=2368, 9 RCTs, RR not 20% improved 0.72 CI 0.59 to 0.88 NNT 8). A similar, favourable outcome for risperidone was found in long‐term studies (n=859, 2RCTs RR not 20% improved 0.51 CI 0.38 to 0.67 NNT 4;n=675 1RCT, RR not improved 40% 0.75 CI 0.66 to 0.84 NNT 5; n=675, 1 RCT, RR not 60% improved 0.90 CI 0.84 to 0.96, NNT 11). Risperidone was also more likely to reduce relapse at one year follow up, compared with haloperidol (n=367, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.41 to 0.99, NNT 7). Less people allocated risperidone left studies before completion, both for short‐term (n=3066, 16 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.63 to 0.92, NNT 6) and long‐term trials (n=1270, 4RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.42 to 0.73 NNT 4). For general movement disorders results favoured risperidone. People given risperidone had significantly fewer general movement disorders (including extrapyramidal side effects) than those receiving older typical antipsychotics (n=2702, 10 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.56 to 0.71, NNT 3). Significantly fewer people given risperidone used antiparkinsonian drugs (n=2524, 11 RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.58 to 0.74, NNT 4). As regards body weight, however, four studies (n=1708) found people were more likely to gain weight if allocated risperidone compared to typical antipsychotics (RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNH 3). Risperidone was no more or less likely than haloperidol to cause sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction (n=106, 2 RCTs, RR 1.55 CI 0.58 to 4.20). Finally, some results found risperidone was more likely to cause rhinitis than conventional antipsychotics (n=656, 3 RCTs, RR1.99 CI 1.24 to 3.19, NNH 3). Authors conclusions Risperidone may be more acceptable to those with schizophrenia than older antipsychotics and have marginal benefits in terms of limited clinical improvement. Its adverse effect profile may be better than haloperidol. With the addition of more studies to this review, the publication bias evident in previous versions is no longer a significant issue. Any marginal benefits this drug may have have to be balanced against its greater cost and increased tendency to cause side effects such as weight gain. Recent important longer term data favouring risperidones effect on relapse needs to be replicated by researchers independently of the manufacturers of the drug. Plain language summary Risperidone versus typical antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia Risperidone is one of the most widely used new generation of antipsychotic drugs. This review summarises its effects compared with the older antipsychotics. In essence, risperidone may be equally clinically effective to relatively high doses of haloperidol, for an outcome that is difficult to interpret as clinically meaningful. Risperidone causes less adverse effects than the side‐effect prone haloperidol."""

Objectives To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost‐effectiveness of risperidone compared with placebo for treating schizophrenia. Search methods On 19th October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We checked the references of all included studies and contacted industry and authors of included studies for relevant studies and data. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and the 95% CI. We created a Summary of findings table using  GRADE  (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results The review includes 15 studies (N = 2428). Risk of selection bias is unclear in most of the studies, especially concerning allocation concealment. Other areas of risk such as missing data and selective reporting also caused some concern, although not affected on the direction of effect of our primary outcome, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. Many of the included trials have industry sponsorship of involvement. Nonetheless, generally people in the risperidone group are more likely to achieve a significant clinical improvement in mental state (6 RCTs, N = 864, RR 0.64, CI 0.52 to 0.78,  very low‐quality evidence ). The effect withstood, even when three studies with >50% attrition rate were removed from the analysis (3 RCTs, N = 589, RR 0.77, CI 0.67 to 0.88). Participants receiving placebo were less likely to have a clinically significant improvement on Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) than those receiving risperidone (4 RCTs, N = 594, RR 0.69, CI 0.57 to 0.83,  very low‐quality evidence ). Overall, the risperidone group was 31% less likely to leave early compared to placebo group (12 RCTs, N = 2261, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.78,  low‐quality evidence ), but Incidence of significant extrapyramidal side effect was more likely to occur in the risperidone group (7 RCTs, N = 1511, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.15,  very low‐quality evidence ). When risperidone and placebo were augmented with clozapine, there is no significant differences between groups for clinical response as defined by a less than 20% reduction in PANSS/BPRS scores (2 RCTs, N = 98, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.42,  low‐quality evidence)  and attrition (leaving the study early for any reason) (3 RCTs, N = 167, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.42,  low quality evidence) . One study measured clinically significant responses using the CGI, no effect was evident (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 1.12 95% CI 0.87 to 1.44,  low quality evidence ). No data were available for extrapyramidal adverse effects. Authors conclusions Based on low quality evidence, risperidone appears to be benefitial in improving mental state compared with placebo, but it also causes more adverse events. Eight out of the 15 included trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The currently available evidence is very low  to  low quality . Plain language summary Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia Review question Is risperidone (tablet form) more effective than placebo in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses? Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These are called ‘positive symptoms’. Mental illness also causes tiredness, apathy, emotional numbness, and withdrawal. These are called ‘negative symptoms’. The main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs can be classified into typical (older) and atypical (newer) drugs. Typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment for decades, and have been effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms, however, have been fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with unpleasant side effects that cause people to stop taking medication, which may lead to relapse. It is thought that newer atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are more effective than the older antipsychotics as they reduce the positive symptoms but cause fewer side effects. Study characteristics Searches for high‐quality randomised trials were carried out in 2008, 2013 and 2015. The review now includes 15 studies with 2428 participants. The studies randomised participants (in‐ and outpatients) with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses into treatment groups that received oral risperidone or placebo. Key results Results from limited data suggest that risperidone is more effective than placebo for reducing the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and participants receiving risperidone were more likely to comply with treatment. However, like the older typical antipsychotics, risperidone was also associated with serious side effects, such as parkinsonism. Quality of the evidence The evidence available was very low quality. Information and data were limited, poorly reported, and probably biased in favour of risperidone . Nearly half of the included trials were funded by drug companies. Firm conclusions are difficult to make based on the results of this review. Better conduct and reporting of trials could increase confidence in the results.

Dual diagnosis can have an adverse effect on treatment and prognosis of SMI. Objectives To evaluate the effects of risperidone compared to treatment with other antipsychotics (first‐generation and other second‐generation antipsychotics) used in people with serious mental illness and co‐occurring substance misuse. Search methods On 6 January 2016 and 9 October 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers). Selection criteria We selected randomised trials of risperidone versus any other antipsychotic in people with SMI and substance abuse (dual diagnosis). We included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. We excluded trials that either did not meet our inclusion criteria or met our inclusion criteria but did not report any useable data. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and selected studies. For included studies, we independently extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% confidence intervals. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analyses and assessed the quality of evidence, creating a Summary of findings table using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified eight randomised trials containing a total of 1073 participants with SMI and co‐occurring substance misuse. Seven of these contributed useable data to the review. There was heterogeneity in trial design and measurement. Risperidone was compared to clozapine, olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. Few trials compared risperidone with first‐generation agents. Few trials examined participants with a dual diagnosis from the outset and most trials only contained separate analyses of subgroups with a dual diagnosis or were secondary data analyses of subgroups of people with a dual diagnosis from existing larger trials. For risperidone versus clozapine we found no clear differences between these two antipsychotics in the reduction of positive psychotic symptoms (1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), n = 36, mean difference (MD) 0.90, 95% CI −2.21 to 4.01,  very low quality evidence ), or reduction in cannabis use (1 RCT, n = 14, risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.35,  very low quality evidence ), improvement in subjective well‐being (1 RCT, n = 36, MD −6.00, 95% CI −14.82 to 2.82,  very low quality evidence ), numbers discontinuing medication (1 RCT, n = 36, RR 4.05, 95% CI 0.21 to 78.76,  very low quality evidence ), extrapyramidal side‐effects (2 RCTs, n = 50, RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.30 to 24.08; I² = 0%,  very low quality evidence ), or leaving the study early (2 RCTs, n = 45, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.51; I² = 34%,  very low quality evidence ). Clozapine was associated with lower levels of craving for cannabis (1 RCT, n = 28, MD 7.00, 95% CI 2.37 to 11.63,  very low quality evidence ). For risperidone versus olanzapine we found no clear differences in the reduction of positive psychotic symptoms (1 RCT, n = 37, MD −1.50, 95% CI −3.82 to 0.82,  very low quality evidence ), reduction in cannabis use (1 RCT, n = 41, MD 0.40, 95% CI −4.72 to 5.52,  very low quality evidence ), craving for cannabis (1 RCT, n = 41, MD 5.00, 95% CI −4.86 to 14.86,  very low quality evidence ), parkinsonism (1 RCT, n = 16, MD −0.08, 95% CI −1.21 to 1.05,  very low quality evidence ), or leaving the study early (2 RCT, n = 77, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35; I² = 0%,  very low quality evidence ). For risperidone versus perphenazine, we found no clear differences in the number of participants leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 281, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20,  low‐quality evidence ). For risperidone versus quetiapine, we found no clear differences in the number of participants leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 294, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07,  low‐quality evidence ). For risperidone versus ziprasidone, we found no clear differences in the number of participants leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 240, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10,  low‐quality evidence ). For many comparisons, important outcomes were missing; and no data were reported in any study for metabolic disturbances, global impression of illness severity, quality of life or mortality. Authors conclusions There is not sufficient good‐quality evidence available to determine the effects of risperidone compared with other antipsychotics in people with a dual diagnosis. Few trials compared risperidone with first‐generation agents, leading to limited applicability to settings where access to second‐generation agents is limited, such as in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Moreover, heterogeneity in trial design and measurement of outcomes precluded the use of many trials in our analyses. Future trials in this area need to be sufficiently powered but also need to conform to consistent methods in study population selection, use of measurement scales, definition of outcomes, and measures to counter risk of bias. Investigators should adhere to CONSORT guidelines in the reporting of results. Plain language summary Risperidone versus other antipsychotics for people with dual diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol or drug use disorder What is dual diagnosis? Dual diagnosis is a term used to describe people who have both a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol or drug use disorder. Up to 75% of people with a serious mental illness (SMI) are dual diagnosis. It has been suggested that one of the reasons behind the high levels of substance use in people with SMI is due to self‐medication, with patients taking additional drugs in order to counter their distressing symptoms. People with a dual diagnosis have been shown to have more complications in their treatment, including higher rates of relapse and re‐hospitalisation, more contact with legal and forensic services, higher levels of psychotic symptoms, more risk‐taking behaviour, greater levels of side‐effects to antipsychotics and lower medication adherence. Antipsychotics are the main treatment for SMI. It has been suggested that second‐generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as risperidone may be superior to older, first‐generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in improving negative affective states, reducing drug craving, improving subjective well‐being, and may lead to fewer side‐effects and hence greater medication adherence. Such improvements in symptoms may lead to less self‐medication with alcohol and drugs, and improved overall mental states. However it remains unclear to what extent risperidone, one of the first atypical antipsychotics to be manufactured, is superior to other antipsychotics for dual diagnosis. Who may be interested in this review? Mental health care practitioners who treat people with SMI and dual diagnosis, and who prescribe antipsychotics for these conditions. People who use mental health services and their families who may be involved in their treatment and care. What does this review aim to answer? How effective and safe is risperidone compared to other antipsychotics for treating people with a dual diagnosis? Which studies were included in the review? We conducted searches for relevant randomised studies in January 2016 and October 2017. We found eight randomised controlled trials with 1073 participants who had a dual diagnosis. The majority of participants were adults over 18 years (4 participants were 17 years). Risperidone was compared to clozapine, olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. What does the evidence from the review tell us? We found no great effect favouring risperidone over any of the other comparison medications. Very limited data were available for side‐effects; and again, we found no real differences between risperidone and other antipsychotics. Overall the quality of the evidence available was graded as low to very low, and currently there is not sufficient evidence to indicate risperidone is superior or inferior to other antipsychotics in the treatment of people with severe mental illness and co‐occurring substance misuse. What should happen next? More high‐quality research is needed. Future research should include samples sufficiently large to detect meaningful clinical differences in outcomes."""

Risperidone is a widely accessible antipsychotic that can be used to manage psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation. Objectives To examine whether oral risperidone alone is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (up to April 2017); this register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid use of risperidone and other drugs, combinations of drugs or placebo for people exhibiting aggression or agitation (or both) thought to be due to psychosis. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and used a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a ’Summary of findings’ tables. Main results The review now contains data from nine trials (total n = 582) reporting on five comparisons. Due to risk of bias, small size of trials, indirectness of outcome measures and a paucity of investigated and reported pragmatic outcomes, evidence was graded as very‐low quality. None of the included studies provided useable data on our primary outcome tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes, repeated need for tranquillisation or any economic outcomes. Data were available for our other main outcomes of agitation or aggression, needing restraint, and incidence of adverse effects. Risperidone versus haloperidol (up to 24 hours follow‐up) For the outcome, specific behaviour ‐ agitation, no clear difference was found between risperidone and haloperidol in terms of efficacy, measured as at least 50% reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ‐ Psychotic Agitation Sub‐score (PANSS‐PAS) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.26; participants = 124; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence) and no effect was observed for need to use restraints (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.21; participants = 28; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Incidence of adverse effects was similar between treatment groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.66; participants = 124; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Risperidone versus olanzapine One small trial (n = 29) reported useable data for the comparison risperidone versus olanzapine. No effect was observed for agitation measured as PANSS‐PAS endpoint score at two hours (MD 2.50, 95% CI ‐2.46 to 7.46; very low‐quality evidence); need to use restraints at four days (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.28; very‐low quality evidence); specific movement disorders measured as Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS) endpoint score at four days (MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.83; very low‐quality evidence). Risperidone versus quetiapine One trial reported (n = 40) useable data for the comparison risperidone versus quetiapine. Aggression was measured using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) endpoint score at two weeks. A clear difference, favouring quetiapine was observed (MD 1.80, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.40; very‐low quality evidence). No evidence of a difference between treatment groups could be observed for incidence of akathisia after 24 hours (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.06; very low‐quality evidence). Two participants allocated to risperidone and one allocated to quetiapine experienced myocardial ischaemia during the trial. Risperidone versus risperidone + oxcarbazepine One trial (n = 68) measured agitation using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ‐ Excited Component.(PANSS‐EC) endpoint score and found a clear difference, favouring the combination treatment at one week (MD 2.70, 95% CI 0.42 to 4.98; very low‐quality evidence), but no effect was observed for global state using Clinical Global Impression ‐ Improvement (CGI‐I) endpoint score at one week (MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.21; very‐low quality evidence). Incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms after 24 hours was similar between treatment groups (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.14; very‐low quality evidence). Risperidone versus risperidone + valproic acid Two trials compared risperidone with a combination of risperidone plus valproic acid.

Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers. It is not clear what positive and negative effects such care may have on them, or on people with dementia. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of respite care for people with dementia and their caregivers, in particular the effect of respite care on rates of institutionalisation. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, using the terms respite* OR daycare OR caregiver* relief. ALOIS contains up‐to‐date records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing respite care with a control intervention for people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors carried out study selection independently and reached a consensus through discussion. Data were extracted by a single review author. The review authors contacted all investigators for methodological details not reported in the text and for additional data for three studies included in the previous version of the review. Main results Four trials are now included in the review, with 753 participants. They were different in many ways including the intervention, duration, outcomes and control group so pooling of data was not possible. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low. Re‐analysis of outcomes using data from the published studies found no significant effects of respite care compared to no respite care on any caregiver variable. When respite care was compared to polarity therapy a significant effect was found in favour of polarity therapy for caregiver perceived stress (n = 38, MD 5.80, 95% CI 1.43 to 10.17), but not for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes. No studies reported evaluable data on outcomes related to the people with dementia. Authors conclusions Current evidence does not demonstrate any benefits or adverse effects from the use of respite care for people with dementia or their caregivers. These results should be treated with caution, however, as they may reflect the lack of high quality research in this area rather than an actual lack of benefit. Given the frequency with which respite care is advocated and provided, well‐designed trials are needed in this area. Plain language summary Respite care for people with dementia and their carers Review question This review aims to see whether respite care can reduce caregiver burden and stress, and increase the length of time for which a person with dementia can continue living at home. Background Caring for someone with dementia can be emotionally and physically demanding. Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers and it is not clear what positive and negative effects such care may have on them, or on people with dementia. Study characteristics Four studies with 753 participants were included in this review. Three compared respite care to no respite care and one compared respite care to polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy. All studies included people with dementia and their caregivers. We were not able to pool the results of the studies as there were so few studies and they measured the outcomes in different ways. All the studies reported outcomes for the caregiver, but only one reported outcomes for the person with dementia. Key results The three studies that compared respite care to no respite care found no evidence of any benefit of respite care for people with dementia or for their caregivers for any outcome, including rates of institutionalisation and caregiver burden. The study that compared respite care to polarity therapy found that polarity therapy decreased caregiver perceived stress but that there was no difference between polarity therapy and respite care for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes. Quality of the evidence A host of methodological problems were identified in the available trials. One study did not report data that could be analysed, the remaining three studies were very small and had a very short duration.

Individuals with PD are often resistant to pharmacological or psychological treatments and this can lead to the disorder becoming a chronic and disabling illness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can deliver sustained and spatially selective current to suppress or induce cortical excitability, and its therapeutic effect on pathological neuronal activity in people with PD has already been examined in case studies and clinical trials. However, a systematic review is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of rTMS for PD. Objectives To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for panic disorder (PD) in adults aged 18 to 65 years, either as a monotherapy or as an augmentation strategy. Search methods An electronic search of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) was conducted to 19 February 2014. The CCDANCTR includes reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years). Additional searches were conducted in Psyndex and the main Chinese medical databases. Selection criteria RCTs or quasi‐randomised trials evaluating rTMS for PD in people aged between 18 and 65 years, either as a monotherapy or as an augmentation strategy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data and verified the data by cross‐checking. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. For binary data, we calculated fixed‐effect model risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated fixed‐effect model standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% CI. Main results Two RCTs (n = 40) were included in this review. The included trials compared rTMS with sham rTMS; no trials comparing rTMS with active treatments (electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy) met our inclusion criteria. Both included studies used 1 Hz rTMS over the right dorso‐lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for two or four weeks as an augmentation treatment for PD. However, in both studies the data for the primary outcome, panic symptoms as measured by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), were skewed and could not be pooled for a quantitative analysis. For this primary outcome one trial with 25 participants reported a superior effect of rTMS in reducing panic symptoms compared with sham rTMS (t = 3.04, df = 16.57, P = 0.007), but this trial had a 16% dropout rate and so was deemed as having a high risk of attrition bias. The other trial found that all 15 participants exhibited a reduction in panic symptoms but there was no significant difference between rTMS and sham rTMS (Mann Whitney U test, P > 0.05). Regarding the acceptability of rTMS, no significant difference was found between rTMS and sham rTMS in dropout rates or in reports of side effects. The quality of evidence contributing to this review was assessed as very low. Assessments of the risk of bias for the two studies were hampered by the lack of information provided in the reports, especially on methods of sequence generation and whether allocation concealment had been applied. Of the remaining sources of bias, we considered one of the studies to have been at risk of attrition bias. Authors conclusions Only two RCTs of rTMS were available and their sample sizes were small. The available data were insufficient for us to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of rTMS for PD. Further trials with large sample sizes and adequate methodology are needed to confirm the effectiveness of rTMS for PD. Plain language summary Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for panic disorder Why is this review important? Panic disorder is a common mental disorder and its lifetime prevalence is 5.1%. The major characteristic of panic disorder is the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks with consequent anxiety about experiencing another attack. Despite major advances in the treatment, many people with panic disorder do not respond well to either medication or psychological therapy. In recent years, an association was found between panic symptoms and increased activity in the right frontal region of the brain. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new technique for the stimulation of the central nervous system. It works through placing an electromagnetic coil against the scalp, which generates a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce localised electrical currents. Low frequency rTMS can reduce this increased activity in the brain and so rTMS is emerging as a new way to treat people with panic disorder. Some studies have investigated the effect of rTMS on patients with PD and observed a reduction in anxiety levels. The aim of this review was to combine the results of all the randomised controlled trials of rTMS for panic disorder to investigate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. Who will be interested in this review? People affected by panic disorder. General practitioners (GPs). Professionals working in adult mental health services. Families and friends of people who suffer from major depression. What questions does this review aim to answer? Is rTMS effective in treating adults with panic disorder, either on its own or in combination with other treatments? Which studies were included in the review? We searched for all the relevant studies on rTMS for panic disorder in people aged 18 to 65 years. Our search found only two studies which met our inclusion criteria and they were included in this review. Information about the way that the studies were conducted were not very well detailed and for one study there was a large proportion of people whose data were not incorporated in to the analysis. The two studies involved a total of 40 people with panic disorder and reported the effect of rTMS on panic symptoms after two or four weeks of rTMS. Both studies used low‐frequency rTMS which lasted 30 minutes and was applied to a region of the brain called the right prefrontal site. Most participants were also taking antidepressant drugs or receiving psychological therapy. No studies compared the differences between rTMS and any other therapy, such as medication, psychological therapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). What does the evidence from the review tell us? One study found that all patients improved during the study period, but the treatment effect did not differ between the group who received rTMS and the group who received sham rTMS. The other study administered more sessions and reported higher levels of improvement of panic symptoms in those people who received rTMS compared to those who received sham rTMS. Although neither trial reported any serious side effects, they provided only very low quality evidence for adverse event outcomes. On the basis of the limited quality of the evidence available we were unable to determine how safe rTMS is. The limited information available from these two studies is insufficient to conclude whether rTMS is effective in reducing the severity of panic disorder symptoms. The main limitation of this review was that the number of people with panic disorder who were involved was too small. What should happen next? To find out more about rTMS for panic disorder, there is a need for more studies to be carried out which involve larger numbers of people and compare sham rTMS with real rTMS."""

Psychological interventions are more acceptable but require considerable therapist training. Acceptable psychological interventions that require less training and skill are needed to ensure increased uptake of intervention. A potential intervention of this sort is relaxation techniques. Objectives To determine whether relaxation techniques reduce depressive symptoms and improve response/remission. Search methods The register of trials kept by the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group was searched up to February 2008. We also searched the reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation imagery, autogenic training) in participants diagnosed with depression or having a high level of depression symptoms. Self‐rated and clinician‐rated depression scores and response/remission were the primary outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers selected the trials, assessed the quality and extracted trial and outcome data, with discrepancies resolved by consultation with a third. Trial authors were approached for missing data where possible and missing data were estimated or imputed in some cases. Continuous measures were summarised using standardised mean differences and dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios. Main results There were 15 trials with 11 included in the meta‐analysis. Five trials showed relaxation reduced self‐reported depression compared to wait‐list, no treatment, or minimal treatment post intervention (SMD ‐0.59 (95% CI ‐0.94 to ‐0.24)). For clinician‐rated depression, two trials showed a non‐significant difference in the same direction (SMD ‐1.35 (95% CI ‐3.06 to 0.37)). Nine trials showed relaxation produced less effect than psychological (mainly cognitive‐behavioural) treatment on self‐reported depression (SMD = 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.62)). Three trials showed no significant difference between relaxation and psychological treatment on clinician‐rated depression at post intervention (SMD 0.29 (95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.75)). Inconsistent effects were found when comparing relaxation training to medication and there were few data available comparing relaxation with complementary and lifestyle treatments. Authors conclusions Relaxation techniques were more effective at reducing self‐rated depressive symptoms than no or minimal treatment. However, they were not as effective as psychological treatment. Data on clinician‐rated depressive symptoms were less conclusive. Further research is required to investigate the possibility of relaxation being used as a first‐line treatment in a stepped care approach to managing depression, especially in younger populations and populations with subthreshold or first episodes of depression. Plain language summary Relaxation for depression Many people with depression do not get treatment or delay getting treatment. One reason for this is that they do not like antidepressants. Another is the limited availability of specialized psychological treatments, such as cognitive‐behaviour therapy. Relaxation techniques are a simple psychological treatment that can be administered after brief training. The review of 15 trials found that it was better than no treatment or minimal treatment, but not as effective as psychological therapies like cognitive‐behaviour therapy. Relaxation techniques have potential as a simple first‐line psychological treatment for depression. Those who do not respond within a set time could be offered more complex psychological treatment such as cognitive‐behaviour therapy."""

Treatments do not have complete success and often require people to take drugs for long periods of time. Many people look for other treatments that may help. One of those is Reiki, a 2500 year old treatment described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy, and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. There have been reports of Reiki alleviating anxiety and depression, but no specific systematic review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of Reiki for treating anxiety and depression in people aged 16 and over. Search methods Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL ‐ all years), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Groups Specialised Register (CCDANCTR ‐ all years), EMBASE, (1974 to November 2014), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2014) and AMED (1985 to November 2014). Additional searches were carried out on the World Health Organization Trials Portal (ICTRP) together with ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. All searches were up to date as of 4 November 2014. Selection criteria Randomised trials in adults with anxiety or depression or both, with at least one arm treated with Reiki delivered by a trained Reiki practitioner. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently decided on inclusion/exclusion of studies and extracted data. A prior analysis plan had been specified but was not needed as the data were too sparse. Main results We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy‐proven diagnosis of non‐metastatic prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external‐beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community‐living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students. These studies included subgroups with anxiety and depression as defined by symptom scores and provided data separately for those subgroups. As this included only 25 people with anxiety and 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression, but which was not specified, the results could only be reported narratively. They show no evidence that Reiki is either beneficial or harmful in this population. The risk of bias for the included studies was generally rated as unclear or high for most domains, which reduces the certainty of the evidence. Authors conclusions There is insufficient evidence to say whether or not Reiki is useful for people over 16 years of age with anxiety or depression or both. Plain language summary Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression Review Question This review summarises the evidence from randomised controlled trials that test whether Reiki if beneficial for people with anxiety or depression. Background Reiki is a non‐drug treatment that is used on people with anxiety, depression or both. Reiki is a 2500 year old treatment, described as a vibrational or subtle energy therapy and is most commonly facilitated by light touch on or above the body. But there is no systematic review of randomised trials evaluating whether it works in this group of people. Study characteristics We found three studies for inclusion in the review.

Objectives To examine the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments for depression in older people. Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 11/9/2006. The International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Irish Journal of Psychiatry were handsearched. Reference lists of previous published systematic reviews, included/excluded trial articles and bibliographies were scrutinised.Experts in the field were contacted.. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that included older adults diagnosed as suffering from depression (ICD or DSM criteria) were included. All types of psychotherapeutic treatments were included, categorised into cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy and supportive therapies. Data collection and analysis Meta‐analysis was performed, using odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were a reduction in severity of depression, usually measured by clinician rated rating scales. Secondary outcomes, including dropout and life satisfaction, were also analysed. Main results The search identified nine trials of cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic therapy approaches, together with a small group of active control interventions. No trials relating to other psychotherapeutic approaches and techniques were found. A total of seven trials provided sufficient data for inclusion in the comparison between CBT and controls. No trials compared psychodynamic psychotherapy with controls. Based on five trials (153 participants), cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than waiting list controls (WMD ‐9.85, 95% CI ‐11.97 to ‐7.73). Only three small trials compared psychodynamic therapy with CBT, with no significant difference in treatment effect indicated between the two types of psychotherapeutic treatment. Based on three trials with usable data, CBT was superior to active control interventions when using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (WMD ‐5.69, 95% CI ‐11.04 to ‐0.35), but equivalent when using the Geriatric Depression Scale (WMD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐5.31 to 1.32). Authors conclusions Only a small number of studies and patients were included in the meta‐analysis. If taken on their own merit, the findings do not provide strong support for psychotherapeutic treatments in the management of depression in older people. However, the findings do reflect those of a larger meta‐analysis that included patients with broader age ranges, suggesting that CBT may be of potential benefit. Plain language summary Psychotherapeutic treatments for older depressed people Depression is a common problem facing older people and is often associated with loneliness, physical illness and pain. The condition can last for some years and causes considerable distress and illness. A significant majority of depressed elders do not receive treatment because of difficulty in recognition of the condition. Not only can it present with lowered mood but may also present with physical problems including sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, loss of interest, anxiety and lack of energy. Psychotherapy is recognised as a treatment for mild depression. In this review we included seven small trials, involving a total of 153 participants, that examined psychotherapeutic treatments for depression in older people. Five trials compared a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) against control conditions, and the findings showed that CBT was more effective than control. Two individual trials compared CBT against psychodynamic therapy, with no significant difference in effectiveness indicated between the two approaches. Our review shows that there is relatively little research in this field and care must be taken in generalising what evidence there is to clinical populations."""

There is a body of research that has evaluated the effect of psychostimulants (PS) in the treatment of depression. This has not been reviewed systematically. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of PS in the treatment of depression and to assess adverse events associated with PS. Search methods Databases CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 21/6/2006. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, AMED, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts and the National Health Service Research Register were searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of PS were included. The trial population comprised adults of either sex with a diagnosis of depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted the data independently and assessed trial quality. Meta‐analysis was considered for trials with comparable key characteristics. The primary outcome was depression symptoms, based on a continuous outcome, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), or a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Twenty‐four RCTs were identified. The overall quality of the trials was low. Five drugs were evaluated; dexamphetamine, methylphenidate, methylamphetamine, pemoline and modafinil. Modafinil was evaluated separately as its pharmacology is different to that of the other PS. PS were administered as a monotherapy, adjunct therapy, in oral or intravenous preparation and in comparison with a placebo or an active therapy. Most effects were measured in the short term (up to four weeks). Thirteen trials had some usable data for meta‐analyses. Three trials (62 participants) demonstrated that oral PS, as a monotherapy, significantly reduced short term depressive symptoms in comparison with placebo (SMD ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.40, ‐0.33, with non‐significant heterogeneity. A similar effect was found for fatigue. In the short term PS were acceptable and well tolerated. Tolerance and dependence were under evaluated. No statistically significant difference in depression symptoms was found between modafinil and placebo. Authors conclusions There is some evidence that in the short‐term, PS reduce symptoms of depression. Whilst this reduction is statistically significant, the clinical significance is less clear. Larger high quality trials with longer follow‐up and evaluation of tolerance and dependence are needed to test the robustness of these findings and, furthermore, to explore which PS may be more beneficial and in which clinical situations they are optimal. Plain language summary Psychostimulants for depression Depression is common and under‐treated. The current first‐line drug treatment for moderate or severe depression is antidepressants, but there are problems with their use. This review evaluated the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of psychostimulants (PS) in the treatment of depression. Twenty‐four RCTs were identified, of which 14 had data for meta‐analysis. Five drugs were evaluated, including dexamphetamine, methylphenidate, methylamphetamine, pemoline and modafinil. Modafinil was evaluated separately as its pharmacology differs from other PS. Three small trials of PS involving a total of 62 participants indicated that oral treatment with PS in the short term (up to four weeks) significantly reduced depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, however, the overall quality of the trials was poor, limiting confidence in the findings. Two trials involving 411 participants compared modafinil against placebo when combined with antidepressant treatment at 6‐8 weeks, and showed a non‐significant difference in reducing depression symptoms. One small trial of 50 participants compared oral modafinil against placebo after 12 weeks of treatment, and also showed a non‐significant difference in reducing depression symptoms. No trials examined the longer‐term effect of PS. Further well conducted trials with long term follow‐up are required to find out which PS may be more effective in the treatment of depression, and whether PS are more effective in certain subgroups of depressed patients."""

Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to reduce antipsychotic medication in care home residents. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, a number of trial registers and grey literature sources were searched on 19th December 2011. Selection criteria Individual or cluster‐randomised controlled trials comparing a psychosocial intervention aimed at reducing antipsychotic medication with usual care in care home residents or comparing two different approaches. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed risk of bias through selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias, as well as criteria related to cluster design. Authors of relevant studies were contacted for additional information. Owing to clinical heterogeneity of interventions, statistical heterogeneity was not assessed and no meta‐analysis performed. Study results are presented in a narrative form. Main results Four cluster‐randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. All of them investigated complex interventions comprising educational approaches. Three studies offered education and training for nursing staff, one study offered multidisciplinary team meetings as main component of the intervention. There was one high‐quality study, but overall the methodological quality of studies was moderate. \u2028 The studies revealed consistent results for the primary end point. All studies documented a decrease of the proportion of residents with antipsychotic drug use or a reduction in days with antipsychotic use per 100 days per resident, respectively. In summary, the reviewed evidence on psychosocial interventions targeting professionals is consistent with a reduction of antipsychotic medication prescription in care home residents. However, owing to heterogeneous approaches, summary effect sizes cannot be determined. Authors conclusions There is evidence to support the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for reducing antipsychotic medication in care home residents. However, the review was based on a small number of heterogeneous studies with important methodological shortcomings. The most recent and methodologically most rigorous study showed the most pronounced effect. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for reducing antipsychotic medication in care home residents In care homes, antipsychotic medication is commonly prescribed to control so called behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia such as agitation, aggression, or restlessness. However, it is questionable whether antipsychotic medication is effective and safe. Adverse effects, such as sedation, falls, and cardiovascular symptoms, are frequent. Therefore, antipsychotic medication should be avoided if possible. This review investigates whether psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing antipsychotic medication in care homes are effective. By psychosocial interventions, we mean programmes that consist of different non‐pharmacological components including talking to the staff, residents, or both. We identified four randomised controlled trials for inclusion in the review. All studies examined, among other components, education targeted at nursing staff in care homes. The methodological quality of three studies was limited, one study showed high quality. In all studies the interventions led to a reduction of antipsychotic medication use, but the overall magnitude of the effect remains unclear."""

Objectives To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for reduction in substance use in people with a serious mental illness compared with standard care. Search methods For this update (2013), the Trials Search Co‐ordinator of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSG) searched the CSG Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of major medical and scientific databases. The principal authors conducted two further searches (8 October 2012 and 15 January 2013) of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. A separate search for trials of contingency management was completed as this was an additional intervention category for this update. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocial interventions for substance misuse with standard care in people with serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis We independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. For all meta‐analyses we pooled data using a random‐effects model. Using the GRADE approach, we identified seven patient‐centred outcomes and assessed the quality of evidence for these within each comparison. Main results We included 32 trials with a total of 3165 participants. Evaluation of long‐term integrated care included four RCTs (n = 735). We found no significant differences on loss to treatment (n = 603, 3 RCTs, RR 1.09 CI 0.82 to 1.45,  low quality of evidence ), death by 3 years (n = 421, 2 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.39 to 3.57,  low quality of evidence ), alcohol use (not in remission at 36 months) (n = 143, 1 RCT, RR 1.15 CI 0.84 to 1.56, low quality of evidence ), substance use (n = 85, 1 RCT, RR 0.89 CI 0.63 to 1.25,  low quality of evidence ), global assessment of functioning (n = 171, 1 RCT, MD 0.7 CI 2.07 to 3.47,  low quality of evidence ), or general life satisfaction (n = 372, 2 RCTs, MD 0.02 higher CI 0.28 to 0.32,  moderate quality of evidence ). For evaluation of non‐integrated intensive case management with usual treatment (4 RCTs, n = 163) we found no statistically significant difference for loss to treatment at 12 months (n = 134, 3 RCTs, RR 1.21 CI 0.73 to 1.99,  very low quality of evidence ). Motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioural therapy compared to usual treatment (7 RCTs, total n = 878) did not reveal any advantage for retaining participants at 12 months (n = 327, 1 RCT, RR 0.99 CI 0.62 to 1.59,  low quality of evidence ) or for death (n = 493, 3 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.22 to 2.41,  low quality of evidence) , and no benefit for reducing substance use (n = 119, 1 RCT, MD 0.19 CI ‐0.22 to 0.6,  low quality of evidence ), relapse (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.5 CI 0.24 to 1.04,  very low quality of evidence ) or global functioning (n = 445, 4 RCTs, MD 1.24 CI 1.86 to 4.34,  very low quality of evidence ). Cognitive behavioural therapy alone compared with usual treatment (2 RCTs, n = 152) showed no significant difference for losses from treatment at 3 months (n = 152, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 0.44 to 2.86,  low quality of evidence ). No benefits were observed on measures of lessening cannabis use at 6 months (n = 47, 1 RCT, RR 1.30 CI 0.79 to 2.15,  very low quality of evidence ) or mental state (n = 105, 1 RCT, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale MD 0.52 CI ‐0.78 to 1.82,  low quality of evidence ). We found no advantage for motivational interviewing alone compared with usual treatment (8 RCTs, n = 509) in reducing losses to treatment at 6 months (n = 62, 1 RCT, RR 1.71 CI 0.63 to 4.64,  very low quality of evidence ), although significantly more participants in the motivational interviewing group reported for their first aftercare appointment (n = 93, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 CI 0.53 to 0.9). Some differences, favouring treatment, were observed in abstaining from alcohol (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.36 CI 0.17 to 0.75,  very low quality of evidence ) but not other substances (n = 89, 1 RCT, RR ‐0.07 CI ‐0.56 to 0.42,  very low quality of evidence ), and no differences were observed in mental state (n = 30, 1 RCT, MD 0.19 CI ‐0.59 to 0.21,  very low quality of evidence ). We found no significant differences for skills training in the numbers lost to treatment by 12 months (n = 94, 2 RCTs, RR 0.70 CI 0.44 to 1.1,  very low quality of evidence ). We found no differences for contingency management compared with usual treatment (2 RCTs, n = 206) in numbers lost to treatment at 3 months (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 1.65 CI 1.18 to 2.31,  low quality of evidence ), number of stimulant positive urine tests at 6 months (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 CI 0.65 to 1.06,  low quality of evidence ) or hospitalisations (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.05 to 0.93,  low quality of evidence ). We were unable to summarise all findings due to skewed data or because trials did not measure the outcome of interest. In general, evidence was rated as low or very low due to high or unclear risks of bias because of poor trial methods, or poorly reported methods, and imprecision due to small sample sizes, low event rates and wide confidence intervals. Authors conclusions We included 32 RCTs and found no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another for people to remain in treatment or to reduce substance use or improve mental state in people with serious mental illnesses. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results. Further high quality trials are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area. Plain language summary Psychosocial interventions for people with both severe mental illness and substance misuse ‘Dual diagnosis’ is the term used to describe people who have a mental health problem and also have problems with drugs or alcohol. In some areas, over 50% of all those with mental health difficulties will have problems with drugs or alcohol. For people with mental illness, substance misuse often has a negative and damaging effect on the symptoms of their illness and the way their medication works. They may become aggressive or engage in activities that are illegal. Substance misuse can also increase risk of suicide, hepatitis C, HIV, relapse, incarceration and homelessness. People who have substance misuse problems but no mental illness can be treated via a variety of psychosocial interventions. These include motivational interviewing, or MI, that looks at people’s motivation for change; cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, which helps people adapt their behaviour by improving coping strategies; a supportive approach similar to that pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous; family psycho‐education observing the signs and effects of substance misuse; and group or individual skills training. However, using these interventions for people with dual diagnosis is more complex. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for substance reduction in people with a serious mental illness compared to care as usual or standard care. A search for studies was carried out in July 2012; 32 studies were included in the review with a total of 3165 people. These studies used a variety of different psychosocial interventions (including CBT, MI, skills training, integrated models of care). In the main, evidence was graded as low or very low quality and no study showed any great difference between psychosocial interventions and treatment as usual. There was no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another. However, differences in study designs made comparisons between studies problematic. Studies also had high numbers of people leaving early, differences in outcomes measured, and differing ways in which the psychosocial interventions were delivered. More large scale, high quality and better reported studies are required to address these shortcomings. This will better address whether psychosocial interventions are effective and good for people with mental illness and substance misuse problems.

Its complex and diverse effects interact with ethnicity, gender, and refugee experience. Health and welfare agencies offer varied rehabilitation services, from conventional mental health treatment to eclectic or needs‐based interventions. This review is needed because relatively little outcome research has been done in this field, and no previous systematic review has been conducted. Resources are scarce, and the challenges of providing services can be considerable. Objectives To assess beneficial and adverse effects of psychological, social and welfare interventions for torture survivors, and to compare these effects with those reported by active and inactive controls. Search methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through a search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Specialised Register (CCDANCTR), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), the Open System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) all years to 11 April 2013; searches of Cochrane resources, international trial registries and the main biomedical databases were updated on 20 June 2014. We also searched the Online Library of Dignity (Danish Institute against Torture), reference lists of reviews and included studies and the most frequently cited journals, up to April 2013 but not repeated for 2014. Investigators were contacted to provide updates or details as necessary. Selection criteria Full publications of RCTs or quasi‐RCTs of psychological, social or welfare interventions for survivors of torture against any active or inactive comparison condition. Data collection and analysis We included all major sources of grey literature in our search and used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration for collecting data, evaluating risk of bias and using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence. Main results Nine RCTs were included in this review. All were of psychological interventions; none provided social or welfare interventions. The nine trials provided data for 507 adults; none involved children or adolescents. Eight of the nine studies described individual treatment, and one discussed group treatment. Six trials were conducted in Europe, and three in different African countries. Most people were refugees in their thirties and forties; most met the criteria for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the outset. Four trials used narrative exposure therapy (NET), one cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and the other four used mixed methods for trauma symptoms, one of which included reconciliation methods. Five interventions were compared with active controls, such as psychoeducation; four used treatment as usual or waiting list/no treatment; we analysed all control conditions together. Duration of therapy varied from one hour to longer than 20 hours with a median of around 12 to 15 hours. All trials reported effects on distress and on PTSD, and two reported on quality of life. Five studies followed up participants for at least six months. No immediate benefits of psychological therapy were noted in comparison with controls in terms of our primary outcome of distress (usually depression), nor for PTSD symptoms, PTSD caseness, or quality of life. At six‐month follow‐up, three NET and one CBT study (86 participants) showed moderate effect sizes for intervention over control in reduction of distress (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.07 to ‐0.19) and of PTSD symptoms (SMD ‐0.52, 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.07). However, the quality of evidence was very low, and risk of bias resulted from researcher/therapist allegiance to treatment methods, effects of uncertain asylum status of some people and real‐time non‐standardised translation of assessment measures. No measures of adverse events were described, nor of participation, social functioning, quantity of social or family relationships, proxy measures by third parties or satisfaction with treatment. Too few studies were identified for review authors to attempt sensitivity analyses. Authors conclusions Very low‐quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of immediate effects on post‐traumatic symptoms, distress or quality of life; however, NET and CBT were found to confer moderate benefits in reducing distress and PTSD symptoms over the medium term (six months after treatment). Evidence was of very low quality, mainly because non‐standardised assessment methods using interpreters were applied, and sample sizes were very small. Most eligible trials also revealed medium to high risk of bias. Further, attention to the cultural appropriateness of interventions or to their psychometric qualities was inadequate, and assessment measures used were unsuitable. As such, these findings should be interpreted with caution. No data were available on whether symptom reduction enabled improvements in quality of life, participation in community life, or in social and family relationships in the medium term. Details of adverse events and treatment satisfaction were not available immediately after treatment nor in the medium term. Future research should aim to address these gaps in the evidence and should include larger sample sizes when possible. Problems of torture survivors need to be defined far more broadly than by PTSD symptoms, and recognition given to the contextual influences of being a torture survivor, including as an asylum seeker or refugee, on psychological and social health.

Psychological treatments are a frequently used approach for OCD. Objectives To perform a systematic review of randomised trials of psychological treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in comparison with treatment as usual. Search methods We conducted an electronic search of CCDANCTR‐Studies (31/10/2006), and other databases. We searched reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Published and unpublished randomised trials of psychological treatments versus treatment as usual for adults with a diagnosis of OCD Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently throughout the selection of trials and data extraction. Findings were compared and disagreements were discussed with a third review author. Full data extraction, using a standardised data extraction sheet, was performed on all studies included in the review. Results were synthesised using Review Manager software. For dichotomous data, odds ratios were calculated. For continuous data, effect sizes were obtained and the standardised mean difference, with 95% confidence intervals, was calculated. Fixed and random effects models were used to pool the data. Reasons for heterogeneity in studies were explored and sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding trials of lower quality. Main results Eight studies (11 study comparisons) were identified, all of which compared cognitive and/or behavioural treatments versus treatment as usual control groups. Seven studies (ten comparisons) had usable data for meta‐analyses. These studies demonstrated that patients receiving any variant of cognitive behavioural treatment exhibited significantly fewer symptoms post‐treatment than those receiving treatment as usual (SMD ‐1.24, 95% CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.87, I² test for heterogeneity 33.4%). Different types of cognitive and/or behavioural treatments showed similar differences in effect when compared with treatment as usual. The overall treatment effect appeared to be influenced by differences in baseline severity. Authors conclusions The findings of this review suggest that psychological treatments derived from cognitive behavioural models are an effective treatment for adult patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Larger high quality randomised controlled trials involving longer follow up periods are needed, to further test cognitive behavioural treatments, and other psychological approaches, in comparison to each other and control conditions. Future trials should examine the predictors of response to each treatment, and also conduct cost‐effectiveness evaluations. Plain language summary Psychological treatments compared with treatment as usual for obsessive compulsive disorder Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder characterised by recurrent obsessions, such as persistent thoughts, impulses or mental images, that promote anxiety, together with compulsions, such as repetitive behaviours or mental acts, that are performed in response to the obsessions. Currently the most commonly used therapies for OCD are pharmacological therapies, followed by psychotherapies, particularly cognitive behavioural approaches. We reviewed studies that compared psychological interventions to treatment as usual groups who either received no treatment, or were on a waiting list for treatment or received usual care. We found eight studies, which together suggested that cognitive and/or behavioural treatments were better than treatment as usual conditions at reducing clinical symptoms. Baseline OCD severity and depressive symptom level predicted the degree of response. However, the conclusions were based on a small number of randomised controlled trials with small sample sizes. There were no trials of other forms of psychological treatment such as psychodynamic therapy and client‐centred therapy, and a lack of available evidence for the long‐term effectiveness of psychological treatments."""

Psychological interventions have been suggested as a potential treatment for these populations. Current research suggests that people with dementia and MCI have limited opportunities for psychological treatments aimed at improving their well‐being. A systematic review of the evidence on their effectiveness is likely to be useful in terms of improving outcomes for patients and for future recommendations for practice. Objectives The main objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing anxiety and depression in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register and additional sources for both published and unpublished data. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a psychological intervention with usual care or a placebo intervention (social contact control) in people with dementia or MCI. Data collection and analysis Two review authors worked independently to select trials, extract data and assess studies for risk of bias, using a data extraction form. We contacted authors when further information was not available from the published articles. Main results Six RCTs involving 439 participants with dementia were included in the review, but no studies of participants with MCI were identified. The studies included people with dementia living in the community or in nursing home care and were carried out in several countries. Only one of the studies was classified as low risk of bias. Five studies were at unclear or high risk of bias due to uncertainties around randomisation, blinding and selective reporting of results. The studies used the different psychological approaches of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and counselling. Two studies were of multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention‐control educational programs, diagnostic feedback or services slightly above usual care. Meta‐analysis showed a positive effect of psychological treatments on depression (6 trials, 439 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.41 to ‐0.03, moderate quality evidence) and on clinician‐rated anxiety (2 trials, 65 participants, mean difference (MD) ‐4.57; 95% CI ‐7.81 to ‐1.32, low quality evidence), but not on self‐rated anxiety (2 trials, SMD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.54) or carer‐rated anxiety (1 trial, MD ‐2.40; 95% CI ‐4.96 to 0.16). Results were compatible with both benefit and harm on the secondary outcomes of patient quality of life, activities of daily living (ADLs), neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition, or on carers self‐rated depressive symptoms, but most of the studies did not measure these outcomes. There were no reports of adverse events. Authors conclusions We found evidence that psychological interventions added to usual care can reduce symptoms of depression and clinician‐rated anxiety for people with dementia. We conclude that psychological interventions have the potential to improve patient well‐being. Further high quality studies are needed to investigate which treatments are most effective and to evaluate the effect of psychological interventions in people with MCI. Plain language summary Psychological treatments for depression and anxiety in dementia and mild cognitive impairment Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although treatment of these symptoms is widely recommended in guidelines, the best way to do this is not clear. Drugs are thought to have limited effectiveness in this context and carry the risk of significant side effects. Psychological treatments can be adapted for use with people with cognitive impairment and may offer an alternative treatment.\u2028 This review identified six randomised controlled trials, including 439 participants, in which a psychological treatment for people with dementia was compared to usual care. Most participants had mild dementia, but one trial was conducted with nursing home residents who had more severe dementia. We found no trials of participants with MCI. The psychological interventions used were based on established psychological models such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling, and interpersonal psychodynamic therapy. In two trials, the psychological treatment was combined with other interventions. We found evidence that psychological treatments can reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. There was also some evidence from two trials that CBT may reduce clinician‐rated anxiety symptoms in people with mild dementia. Due to the imprecision of our results, we could not tell whether psychological treatments had an effect on patients quality of life, ability to perform daily activities, overall psychiatric symptoms, or cognition, or on carers self‐rated depressive symptoms, but most studies did not measure these outcomes.\u2028 Although these results are promising, the small number of studies and the variation between them in the type and duration of treatment make it difficult to draw conclusions about the best way to provide psychological treatment for people with dementia who have symptoms of depression or anxiety. More high quality trials in this area would be beneficial, including trials involving participants with MCI."""

Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. Main results We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. Authors conclusions The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors"""

Depression is highly debilitating, affecting psychosocial, family and academic functioning. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, for the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents. We have examined clinical outcomes including remission, clinician and self reported depression measures, and suicide‐related outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Groups Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 11 June 2014. The register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Selection criteria RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they compared i) any psychological therapy with any antidepressant medication, or ii) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a psychological therapy alone, or an antidepressant medication alone, or iii) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a placebo or  treatment as usual, or (iv) a combination of psychological therapy and antidepressant medication with a psychological therapy or antidepressant medication plus a placebo. We included studies if they involved participants aged between 6 and 18 years, diagnosed by a clinician as having Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies. We applied a random‐effects meta‐analysis, using the odds ratio (OR) to describe dichotomous outcomes, mean difference (MD) to describe continuous outcomes when the same measures were used, and standard mean difference (SMD) when outcomes were measured on different scales. Main results We included eleven studies, involving 1307 participants in this review. We also identified one ongoing study, and two additional ongoing studies that may be eligible for inclusion. Studies recruited participants with different severities of disorder and with a variety of comorbid disorders, including anxiety and substance use disorder, therefore limiting the comparability of the results. Regarding the risk of bias in studies, just under half the studies had adequate allocation concealment (there was insufficient information to determine allocation concealment in the remainder), outcome assessors were blind to the participants intervention in six studies, and in general, studies reported on incomplete data analysis methods, mainly using intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses. For the majority of outcomes there were no statistically significant differences between the interventions compared. There was limited evidence (based on two studies involving 220 participants) that antidepressant medication was more effective than psychotherapy on measures of clinician defined remission immediately post‐intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.98), with 67.8% of participants in the medication group and 53.7% in the psychotherapy group rated as being in remission. There was limited evidence (based on three studies involving 378 participants) that combination therapy was more effective than antidepressant medication alone in achieving higher remission from a depressive episode immediately post‐intervention (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.47), with 65.9% of participants treated with combination therapy and 57.8% of participants treated with medication, rated as being in remission. There was no evidence to suggest that combination therapy was more effective than psychological therapy alone, based on clinician rated remission immediately post‐intervention (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 8.68). Suicide‐related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in various ways across studies and could not be combined in meta‐analyses. However, some trials measured suicidal ideation using standardised assessment tools suitable for meta‐analysis. In one study involving 188 participants, rates of suicidal ideation were significantly higher in the antidepressant medication group (18.6%) compared with the psychological therapy group (5.4%) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.72) and this effect appeared to remain at six to nine months (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98), with 13.6% of participants in the medication group and 3.9% of participants in the psychological therapy group reporting suicidal ideation. It was unclear what the effect of combination therapy was compared with either antidepressant medication alone or psychological therapy alone on rates of suicidal ideation. The impact of any of the assigned treatment packages on drop out was also mostly unclear across the various comparisons in the review. Limited data and conflicting results based on other outcome measures make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of any specific intervention based on these outcomes. Authors conclusions There is very limited evidence upon which to base conclusions about the relative effectiveness of psychological interventions, antidepressant medication and a combination of these interventions. On the basis of the available evidence, the effectiveness of these interventions for treating depressive disorders in children and adolescents cannot be established. Further appropriately powered RCTs are required. Plain language summary Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, with suggested overall prevalence rates for adolescents (13 to 18 years) being 5.7% and for children (under 13 years) 2.8%. Common symptoms of depression in children and adolescents include low mood, a loss of interest in once enjoyed activities, difficulties with concentration and motivation, changes in appetite and sleep, irritability, physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach aches and in some cases thoughts of suicide. If left untreated, depressive disorders in the younger years are likely to continue into adulthood, and can be increasingly difficult to treat as time goes on. Both psychological therapies and antidepressant medication can be used to treat depression in children and adolescents. Psychological therapies, sometimes called talking therapies, involve working with a qualified therapist to treat the depression. Psychological therapies in common use are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychodynamic therapy. There are many different types of antidepressant medication, all of which have been developed specifically to work on chemicals in the brain that are believed to be linked to depression. Research has been undertaken on psychological therapies and antidepressant medication, alone and in combination, to asses the effects of these interventions on depression in children and adolescents. In order to asses whether either intervention or a combination of both is most effective, we included studies that compared"""

Mental disorders with a higher prevalence in these settings include post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform (e.g. medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS)), and related disorders. A range of psychological therapies are used to manage symptoms of mental disorders in this population. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies versus control conditions (wait list, treatment as usual, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or no treatment) aimed at treating people with mental disorders (PTSD and major depressive, anxiety, somatoform, and related disorders) living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), and PsycINFO (OVID), with results incorporated from searches to 3 February 2016. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any unpublished or ongoing studies. We checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies versus control conditions (including no treatment, usual care, wait list, attention placebo, and psychological placebo) to treat adults and children with mental disorders living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane procedures for collecting data and evaluating risk of bias. We calculated standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous data, using a random‐effects model. We analysed data at endpoint (zero to four weeks after therapy); at medium term (one to four months after therapy); and at long term (six months or longer). GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the quality of evidence for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and withdrawal outcomes. Main results We included 36 studies (33 RCTs) with a total of 3523 participants. Included studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia. Studies were implemented in response to armed conflicts; disasters triggered by natural hazards; and other types of humanitarian crises. Together, the 33 RCTs compared eight psychological treatments against a control comparator. Four studies included children and adolescents between 5 and 18 years of age. Three studies included mixed populations (two studies included participants between 12 and 25 years of age, and one study included participants between 16 and 65 years of age). Remaining studies included adult populations (18 years of age or older). Included trials compared a psychological therapy versus a control intervention (wait list in most studies; no treatment; treatment as usual). Psychological therapies were categorised mainly as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) in 23 comparisons (including seven comparisons focused on narrative exposure therapy (NET), two focused on common elements treatment approach (CETA), and one focused on brief behavioural activation treatment (BA)); eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) in two comparisons; interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in three comparisons; thought field therapy (TFT) in three comparisons; and trauma or general supportive counselling in two comparisons. Although interventions were described under these categories, several psychotherapeutic elements were common to a range of therapies (i.e. psychoeducation, coping skills). In adults, psychological therapies may substantially reduce endpoint PTSD symptoms compared to control conditions (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.34 to ‐0.79; 1272 participants; 16 studies; low‐quality evidence). The effect is smaller at one to four months (SMD ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐0.68 to ‐0.31; 1660 participants; 18 studies) and at six months (SMD ‐0.37, 95% CI ‐0.61 to ‐0.14; 400 participants; five studies). Psychological therapies may also substantially reduce endpoint depression symptoms compared to control conditions (SMD ‐0.86, 95% CI ‐1.06 to ‐0.67; 1254 participants; 14 studies; low‐quality evidence). Similar to PTSD symptoms, follow‐up data at one to four months showed a smaller effect on depression (SMD ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.21; 1386 participants; 16 studies). Psychological therapies may moderately reduce anxiety at endpoint (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.49; 694 participants; five studies; low‐quality evidence) and at one to four months follow‐up after treatment (SMD ‐0.53, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.39; 969 participants; seven studies). Dropout rates are probably similar between study conditions (19.5% with control versus 19.1% with psychological therapy (RR 0.98 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16; 2930 participants; 23 studies, moderate quality evidence)). In children and adolescents, we found very low quality evidence for lower endpoint PTSD symptoms scores in psychotherapy conditions (CBT) compared to control conditions, although the confidence interval is wide (SMD ‐1.56, 95% CI ‐3.13 to 0.01; 130 participants; three studies;). No RCTs provided data on major depression or anxiety in children. The effect on withdrawal was uncertain (RR 1.87 95% CI 0.47 to 7.47; 138 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence). We did not identify any studies that evaluated psychological treatments on (symptoms of) somatoform disorders or MUPS in LMIC humanitarian settings. Authors conclusions There is low quality evidence that psychological therapies have large or moderate effects in reducing PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in adults living in humanitarian settings in LMICs. By one to four month and six month follow‐up assessments treatment effects were smaller. Fewer trials were focused on children and adolescents and they provide very low quality evidence of a beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing PTSD symptoms at endpoint. Confidence in these findings is influenced by the risk of bias in the studies and by substantial levels of heterogeneity. More research evidence is needed, particularly for children and adolescents over longer periods of follow‐up. Plain language summary Talking therapy for the management of mental health in low‐ and middle‐income countries affected by mass human tragedy Why is this review important? Adults and children and adolescents living in humanitarian contexts (such as in the aftermath of a crisis triggered by natural hazards) in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) are exposed to multifaceted stressors that make them more vulnerable to developing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, anxiety, and other negative psychological outcomes. Who will be interested in this review? People who are directly exposed to humanitarian crises and their families and caregivers will be interested in this review, as will healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals working both in LMICs and in high‐income settings. Moreover, policy makers, humanitarian programming staff, guideline developers, and agencies (such as non‐governmental organisations (NGOs)) working in health and non‐health sectors (e.g. those providing protection to populations living in humanitarian contexts) may be interested in this review. What questions does this review aim to answer? Are psychological therapies more effective than control comparator conditions (including no treatment, usual care, wait list, attention placebo, and psychological placebo) in reducing (symptoms of) PTSD and major depressive, anxiety, and somatoform and related disorders (conditions in which people present physical symptoms (e.g. pain) that cannot be explained medically) in people of any age, gender, or religion living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises? Which studies were included in this review? Review authors searched databases up to February 2016 to find and include all relevant published and unpublished trials. Studies had to include children and/or adults living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. Studies also had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which means that people were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive the treatment or comparator condition. We included 33 trials with a total of 3523 participants that examined a range of psychological therapies. What does evidence presented in the review tell us? In adults, low‐quality evidence shows greater benefit from psychological therapies than from control comparators in reducing (symptoms of) PTSD, major depression, and anxiety disorders. This evidence supports the approach of providing psychological therapies to populations affected by humanitarian crises, although we identified no studies that looked at the effectiveness or acceptability of psychological therapies for depressive and anxiety symptoms beyond six months. Only a small proportion of included trials reported data on children and adolescents, which provided very low‐quality evidence of greater benefit derived from psychological treatments. With regard to acceptability, moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence suggests no differences in dropout rates among adults and children and adolescents. Reviewers found no studies evaluating psychological treatments for (symptoms of) somatoform disorders or medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) in adults, nor in children or adolescents, respectively. What should happen next? Researchers should conduct higher‐quality trials to further evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies provided over longer periods to adults and to children and adolescents. Ideally, trials should be randomised, should use culturally appropriate and validated instruments to evaluate outcomes, and should assess correlates of reductions in treatment effects over time; in addition, researchers should make every effort to ensure high rates of follow‐up beyond six months after completion of therapy."""

Projections of the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that prevalence rates of COPD continue to increase, and by 2030, it will become the worlds third leading cause of death. Depression is a major comorbidity amongst patients with COPD, with an estimate prevalence of up to 80% in severe stages of COPD. Prevalence studies show that patients who have COPD are four times as likely to develop depression compared to those without COPD. Regrettably, they rarely receive appropriate treatment for COPD‐related depression. Available findings from trials indicate that untreated depression is associated with worse compliance with medical treatment, poor quality of life, increased mortality rates, increased hospital admissions and readmissions, prolonged length of hospital stay, and subsequently, increased costs to the healthcare system. Given the burden and high prevalence of untreated depression, it is important to evaluate and update existing experimental evidence using rigorous methodology, and to identify effective psychological therapies for patients with COPD‐related depression. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2018, Issue 11), and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from June 2016 to 26 November 2018. Previously these databases were searched via the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups Specialised Trials Registers (all years to June 2016).

Additionally, the grey literature databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full‐text screening were also searched. Selection criteria Eligible for inclusion were randomised controlled trials that compared the use of psychological therapies with either no intervention, education, or combined with a co‐intervention and compared with the same co‐intervention in a population of patients with COPD whose depressive symptoms were measured before or at baseline assessment.

The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non‐randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of psychological therapy, light therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence. Main results We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full‐text review for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of blinding. The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45‐ to 60‐minute sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology‐Self‐Report (IDS‐SR, range 0‐90) from September 2011 to mid‐April 2012. The incidence of a new depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS‐SR ≥ 20), compared to 74% of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality‐evidence). For participants with depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups. Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS‐SR, and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI ‐3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality‐evidence). The overall discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low quality‐evidence). Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors conclusions The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes a depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who might be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced SAD or who has relatives and friends who have experienced SAD, as well as researchers working in this field might be interested in this review. What questions does this review aim to answer? The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. However, little is known about the efficacy and potential harms of interventions for preventing SAD. This is one of four reviews conducted to examine the efficacy and side effects of interventions used to prevent SAD; this review focuses on psychological therapy as a preventive intervention in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms at the time the preventive intervention was started. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to 19 June 2018 for studies on psychological therapies to prevent SAD. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received a form of psychological therapy ‐ the so called mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) or treatment as usual. Treatment as usual meant that participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. All individuals in these studies had a history of winter depression and were free of depressive symptoms when the study started. What does evidence from this review reveal? The proportion of participants developing a depression in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups as well as the severity of these depressive episodes. However, the quality of the evidence was very low, so we can draw no valid conclusion if MBCT is really ineffective in preventing SAD or not. The included study reported no information on side effects of the intervention. Doctors need to discuss with patients the advantages and disadvantages of MBCT and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as other psychological therapies, drug treatments, or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, treatment selection should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of different psychological therapies in preventing SAD in larger study samples and should directly compare these interventions versus other preventive treatments, such as light therapy, antidepressants and agomelatine, to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD."""

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a behavioural disorder in which the use of one or more substances is associated with heightened levels of distress, clinically significant impairment of functioning, or both. PTSD and SUD frequently occur together. The comorbidity is widely recognised as being difficult to treat and is associated with poorer treatment completion and poorer outcomes than for either condition alone. Several psychological therapies have been developed to treat the comorbidity, however there is no consensus about which therapies are most effective. Objectives To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies aimed at treating traumatic stress symptoms, substance misuse symptoms, or both in people with comorbid PTSD and SUD in comparison with control conditions (usual care, waiting‐list conditions, and no treatment) and other psychological therapies. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group’s Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) all years to 11 March 2015. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov, contacted experts, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of individual or group psychological therapies delivered to individuals with PTSD and comorbid substance use, compared with waiting‐list conditions, usual care, or minimal intervention or to other psychological therapies. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included 14 studies with 1506 participants, of which 13 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Most studies involved adult populations. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings. We performed four comparisons investigating the effects of psychological therapies with a trauma‐focused component and non‐trauma‐focused interventions against treatment as usual/minimal intervention and other active psychological therapies. Comparisons were stratified for individual‐ or group‐based therapies. All active interventions were based on cognitive behavioural therapy. Our main findings were as follows. Individual‐based psychological therapies with a trauma‐focused component plus adjunctive SUD intervention was more effective than treatment as usual (TAU)/minimal intervention for PTSD severity post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.72 to ‐0.10; 4 studies; n = 405; very low‐quality evidence) and at 3 to 4 and 5 to 7 months follow‐up. There was no evidence of an effect for level of drug/alcohol use post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.13; 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; 3 studies; n = 388; very low‐quality evidence), but there was a small effect in favour of individual psychological therapy at 5 to 7 months (SMD ‐0.28; 95% CI ‐0.48 to ‐0.07; 3 studies; n = 388) when compared against TAU. Fewer participants completed trauma‐focused therapy than TAU (risk ratio (RR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96; 3 studies; n = 316; low‐quality evidence). Individual‐based psychological therapy with a trauma‐focused component did not perform better than psychological therapy for SUD only for PTSD severity (mean difference (MD) ‐3.91; 95% CI ‐19.16 to 11.34; 1 study; n = 46; low‐quality evidence) or drug/alcohol use (MD ‐1.27; 95% CI ‐5.76 to 3.22; 1 study; n = 46; low‐quality evidence). Findings were based on one small study. No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.36; 1 study; n = 62; low‐quality evidence). Non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapies did not perform better than TAU/minimal intervention for PTSD severity when delivered on an individual (SMD ‐0.22; 95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.39; 1 study; n = 44; low‐quality evidence) or group basis (SMD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.16; 4 studies; n = 513; low‐quality evidence). There were no data on the effects on drug/alcohol use for individual therapy. There was no evidence of an effect on the level of drug/alcohol use for group‐based therapy (SMD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.31; 4 studies; n = 414; very low‐quality evidence). A post‐hoc analysis for full dose of a widely established group therapy called Seeking Safety showed reduced drug/alcohol use post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.67; 95% CI ‐1.14 to ‐0.19; 2 studies; n = 111), but not at subsequent follow‐ups. Data on the number of participants completing therapy were not for individual‐based therapy. No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion for group‐based therapy (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45; 2 studies; n = 217; low‐quality evidence). Non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapy did not perform better than psychological therapy for SUD only for PTSD severity (SMD ‐0.26; 95% CI ‐1.29 to 0.77; 2 studies; n = 128; very low‐quality evidence) or drug/alcohol use (SMD 0.22; 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.57; 2 studies; n = 128; low‐quality evidence). No effects were observed for rates of therapy completion (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20; 2 studies; n = 128; very low‐quality evidence). Several studies reported on adverse events. There were no differences between rates of such events in any comparison. We rated several studies as being at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains, including for detection bias and attrition bias. Authors conclusions We assessed the evidence in this review as mostly low to very low quality. Evidence showed that individual trauma‐focused psychological therapy delivered alongside SUD therapy did better than TAU/minimal intervention in reducing PTSD severity post‐treatment and at long‐term follow‐up, but only reduced SUD at long‐term follow‐up. All effects were small, and follow‐up periods were generally quite short. There was evidence that fewer participants receiving trauma‐focused therapy completed treatment. There was very little evidence to support use of non‐trauma‐focused individual‐ or group‐based integrated therapies. Individuals with more severe and complex presentations (e.g. serious mental illness, individuals with cognitive impairment, and suicidal individuals) were excluded from most studies in this review, and so the findings from this review are not generalisable to such individuals. Some studies suffered from significant methodological problems and some were underpowered, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Further research is needed in this area. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for post‐traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder Who may be interested in this review? • Individuals with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) and their families and friends. • Healthcare providers for individuals with PTSD and SUD. Why is this review important? Many people have PTSD or SUD. Both conditions can impact everyday functioning. A number of different psychological therapies are successful at treating PTSD and SUD when they occur separately. However, PTSD and SUD often occur together, and it may be harder to treat individuals with both PTSD and SUD. A number of psychological therapies have been developed to treat people with both PTSD and SUD, but it is not clear how effective these therapies are. What questions does this review aim to answer? We sought to find out whether psychological therapies are effective in treating people with PTSD and SUD in comparison to control conditions and other psychological therapies. Which studies were included in the review? We searched scientific databases to find all published and unpublished studies of psychological therapies to treat people with PTSD and SUD up to 11 March 2015. We included 14 studies with 1506 participants. What does the evidence from the review tell us? The evidence showed that individual trauma‐focused psychological therapy delivered alongside SUD therapies was more effective in reducing PTSD compared to treatment as usual. This result was found both straight after treatment and at long‐term follow‐up. However, SUD severity only declined at long‐term follow‐up. More people dropped out of the trauma‐focused therapy compared with treatment as usual. Overall, the benefits of trauma‐focused treatment were small. We found little evidence for the benefit of individual‐ or group‐based non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapies. For group‐based therapies, we found that substance use was reduced post‐treatment when participants were offered a full course of 25 sessions of the therapy Seeking Safety, which was delivered in a group setting. However, this positive effect did not continue at later follow‐up points. The level of drop‐out was high across all studies. We graded the quality of evidence as low to very low. This review includes a small number of studies. Some included studies were poorly designed, and most studies were small. There was also considerable variation in the way that the therapies and control therapies were delivered. It is likely that participants in the included studies received a range of other stabilising interventions alongside trauma‐focused treatment, and we found no evidence to support the delivery of trauma‐focused therapies without SUD‐focused therapies. It is therefore possible that our findings will change as further evidence of higher quality is accumulated. Healthcare providers should exercise caution when considering whether to provide therapies described in this review."""

Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. A previous Cochrane meta‐analysis suggested that psychological therapy (either alone or combined with pharmacotherapy) can be chosen as a first‐line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. However, it is not yet clear whether certain psychological therapies can be considered superior to others. In order to answer this question, in this review we performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA), in which we compared eight different forms of psychological therapy and three forms of a control condition.

The effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of psychological therapies as a group has not yet been evaluated in the treatment of GAD. Objectives To examine the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies, categorised as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive therapy, compared with treatment as usual/waiting list (TAU/WL) and compared with one another, for patients with GAD. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register and conducted supplementary searches of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, LILACS and controlledtrials.com in February 2006. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials conducted in non‐inpatient settings, involving adults aged 18‐75 years with a primary diagnosis of GAD, assigned to a psychological therapy condition compared with TAU/WL or another psychological therapy. Data collection and analysis Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed. The primary outcome was anxiety reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta‐analyses. Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post‐treatment (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.74), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer‐term assessments of CBT against TAU/WL. Six studies compared CBT against supportive therapy (non‐directive therapy and attention‐placebo conditions). No significant difference in clinical response was indicated between CBT and supportive therapy at post‐treatment (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.06), however, significant heterogeneity was indicated, which was partly explained by the number of therapy sessions. Authors conclusions Psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short‐term treatment of GAD. The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective. Further studies examining non‐CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for people with generalised anxiety disorder Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a very common condition, in which people suffer from excessive worry or anxiety about everyday events and problems. Psychological therapies are a popular form of treatment for anxiety disorders. This review aimed to find out whether psychological therapies are effective for GAD, and whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is more effective than other psychological therapy approaches, including psychodynamic and supportive therapies. The review included 25 studies, with a total of 1305 participants. All the studies used a CBT approach, and compared CBT against treatment as usual or waiting list (13 studies), or against another psychological therapy (12 studies). The review showed that people attending for psychological therapy based on a CBT approach were more likely to have reduced anxiety at the end of treatment than people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for therapy. CBT was also very effective in reducing secondary symptoms of worry and depression. People who attended for group CBT and older people were more likely to drop out of therapy. None of the studies comparing CBT with treatment as usual or waiting list looked at the long‐term effectiveness of CBT. It is not clear whether people attending for CBT sessions were more likely to have reduced anxiety than people attending for psychodynamic therapy or supportive therapy, because only one study compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, and the six studies that compared CBT with supportive therapy showed differing results. None of the studies included in the review reported on the possible side effects or acceptability of psychological therapies. More studies should be carried out to establish whether psychodynamic and supportive therapies are effective for GAD, and whether CBT is more helpful than other psychological therapy approaches in treating GAD."""

A wide range of psychological treatments are used to prevent negative outcomes associated with trauma in children and adolescents. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological therapies in preventing PTSD and associated negative emotional, behavioural and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents who have undergone a traumatic event. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Groups Specialised Register to 29 May 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from  The Cochrane Library ( all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. We did not restrict the searches by date, language or publication status. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies compared with a control such as treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment, pharmacological therapy or other treatments in children or adolescents who had undergone a traumatic event. Data collection and analysis Two members of the review group independently extracted data. We calculated odds ratios for binary outcomes and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes using a random‐effects model. We analysed data as short‐term (up to and including one month after therapy), medium‐term (one month to one year after therapy) and long‐term (one year or longer). Main results Investigators included 6201 participants in the 51 included trials. Twenty studies included only children, two included only preschool children and ten only adolescents; all others included both children and adolescents. Participants were exposed to sexual abuse in 12 trials, to war or community violence in ten, to physical trauma and natural disaster in six each and to interpersonal violence in three; participants had suffered a life‐threatening illness and had been physically abused or maltreated in one trial each. Participants in remaining trials were exposed to a range of traumas. Most trials compared a psychological therapy with a control such as treatment as usual, wait list or no treatment. Seventeen trials used cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT); four used family therapy; three required debriefing; two trials each used eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), narrative therapy, psychoeducation and supportive therapy; and one trial each provided exposure and CBT plus narrative therapy. Eight trials compared CBT with supportive therapy, two compared CBT with EMDR and one trial each compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, exposure plus supportive therapy with supportive therapy alone and narrative therapy plus CBT versus CBT alone. Four trials compared individual delivery of psychological therapy to a group model of the same therapy, and one compared CBT for children versus CBT for both mothers and children. The likelihood of being diagnosed with PTSD in children and adolescents who received a psychological therapy was significantly reduced compared to those who received no treatment, treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for up to a month following treatment (odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.77; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6.25, 95% CI 3.70 to 16.67; five studies; 874 participants). However the overall quality of evidence for the diagnosis of PTSD was rated as very low. PTSD symptoms were also significantly reduced for a month after therapy (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐0.61 to ‐0.24; 15 studies; 2051 participants) and the quality of evidence was rated as low. These effects of psychological therapies were not apparent over the longer term. CBT was found to be no more or less effective than EMDR and supportive therapy in reducing diagnosis of PTSD in the short term (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.91; 2 studies; 160 participants), however this was considered very low quality evidence. For reduction of PTSD symptoms in the short term, there was a small effect favouring CBT over EMDR, play therapy and supportive therapies (SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.05; 7 studies; 466 participants). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as moderate. We did not identify any studies that compared pharmacological therapies with psychological therapies. Authors conclusions The meta‐analyses in this review provide some evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in prevention of PTSD and reduction of symptoms in children and adolescents exposed to trauma for up to a month. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by the quality of the included studies and by substantial heterogeneity between studies. Much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies for children exposed to trauma, particularly over the longer term. High‐quality studies should be conducted to compare these therapies. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents Why is this review important? Children and adolescents who have experienced trauma are at high risk of developing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and negative psychological and social outcomes. Who will be interested in this review? Children and adolescents who have undergone trauma and their families and caregivers will be interested in this review, along with healthcare professionals, particularly those working in mental health services for children and adolescents. What questions does this review aim to answer? • What are the effects of psychological therapies in preventing PTSD and other negative emotional, behavioural and mental health outcomes in children and adolescents exposed to a traumatic event? • Which psychological therapies are most effective? • Are psychological therapies more effective than pharmacological therapies or other treatments? Which studies were included in the review? Review authors searched databases to May 2015 to find all relevant trials. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include both children and adolescents exposed to trauma. We included 51 trials with a total of 6201 participants. Participants had been exposed to sexual abuse in 12 trials, to war or community violence in ten, to physical trauma and natural disaster in six each and to interpersonal violence in three. In one trial each, participants had suffered a life‐threatening illness or had been physically abused or maltreated. Participants in the remaining trials were exposed to a range of traumas. Most trials compared psychological therapy with a control condition such as treatment as usual, waiting list or no treatment; others compared different psychological therapies. A total of 43 studies reported outcomes recorded within the first month after treatment; 27 studies reported outcomes from one month up to a year, and eight reported data for a year or longer after treatment. What does evidence presented in the review tell us? Children and adolescents receiving psychological therapies were less likely to be diagnosed with PTSD and had fewer symptoms of PTSD up to a month after treatment compared with those who received no treatment, treatment as usual or were on a waiting list. Our confidence in these findings is limited as the overall quality of evidence was very low to low. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies beyond one month. There was moderate quality evidence that cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) might be more effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD compared to other psychological therapies for up to a month. Adverse effects were not reported. There were no studies which compared psychological therapies to drug treatments. What should happen next? Researchers should conduct high‐quality trials to further evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies for children and adolescents exposed to trauma. These trials should be designed to ensure that participants and their families are not aware of whether they are receiving psychological therapy, particularly when measures are completed by participants or their parents. In addition, efforts should be made to ensure high rates of follow‐up beyond one month after completion of therapy. In addition, studies should compare different types of psychological therapy to give a better indication of whether children and adolescents exposed to different types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to these therapies."""

These individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression, sometimes directly related to their illness or medical care (e.g. health‐related anxiety). There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. Therapies designed for children and adolescents without medical issues may or may not be appropriate for use with those who have long‐term physical conditions. Objectives This review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison with controls (treatment‐as‐usual, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or non‐psychological treatment) for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 27 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to May 2016). In addition, we searched the Web of Science (Core Collection) (12 October 2018) and conducted a cited reference search for reports of all included trials. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and grey literature. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials and cross‐over trials of psychological therapies for treating anxiety or depression in children with long‐term physical conditions were included. Data collection and analysis Abstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two authors. Discrepancies were addressed by a third author. Odds ratio (OR) was used for comparing dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) for comparing continuous data. Meta‐analysis was undertaken when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar. Otherwise, narrative analysis of data was undertaken. Main results Twenty‐eight RCTs and one cross‐over trial with 1349 participants were included in the review. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high‐income countries. For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short‐term depression (versus any control), there was low‐quality evidence from 16 trials involving 1121 participants suggesting that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.03; I 2  = 79%). For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short‐term anxiety (versus any control), there was inadequate evidence of moderate‐quality from 13 studies involving 578 participants to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions (SMD ‐0.26, CI ‐0.59 to 0.07, I 2  = 72%). Planned sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken for risk of bias due to the small number of trials that rated high for each domain. Additional sensitivity analysis demonstrated that psychological interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than psychological therapies designed to improve other symptoms or general coping. There was some suggestion from subgroup analyses that they type of intervention (Chi² = 14.75, df = 5 (P = 0.01), I² = 66.1%), the severity of depression (Chi² = 23.29, df = 4 (P = 0.0001), I² = 82.8%) and the type of long‐term physical condition (Chi² = 10.55, df = 4 (P = 0.03), I² = 62.1%) may have an impact on the overall treatment effect.There was qualitative (reported), but not quantitative evidence confirming the acceptability of selected psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. There was low‐quality evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions in improving quality of life (SMD 1.13, CI 0.44 to 1.82, I 2  = 89%) and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions (SMD ‐0.34, CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.06, I 2  = 70%), but only in the short term. There was inadequate low‐quality evidence to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions at improving functioning in either the short term or long term. No trials of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety were identified and only two trials reported adverse effects; these were unrelated to psychological therapies. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, results were heterogeneous, and only one trial had an available protocol. Authors conclusions A limited number of trials of variable quality have been undertaken to assess whether psychological therapies are effective for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. According to the available evidence, therapies specifically designed to treat anxiety or depression (especially those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) may be more likely to work in children and adolescents who have mild to moderate levels of symptoms of these disorders, at least in the short term. There is a dearth of therapies specifically designed to treat health‐related anxiety in this age group. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions Why is this review important? More than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review aims to answer the following questions"""

The effectiveness of trauma‐focused psychological interventions (TFPIs) for PTSD in the general population is well‐established. TFPIs involve identifying and changing unhelpful beliefs about traumatic experiences, processing of traumatic memories, and developing new ways of responding to cues associated with trauma. Little is known about the potential feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of TFPIs for individuals who have a SMI and PTSD. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological interventions for PTSD symptoms or other symptoms of psychological distress arising from trauma in people with SMI. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Study‐Based Register (up until March 10, 2016), screened reference lists of relevant reports and reviews, and contacted trial authors for unpublished and/or specific outcome data. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated TFPIs for people with SMI and PTSD, and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis Three review authors (DS, MF, IN) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all references identified, and read short‐listed full text papers. We assessed risk of bias in each case. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data, on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We assessed quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and created Summary of findings tables.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review (2012) which was first updated in 2015. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and trials registries for studies published up to July 2018. Selection criteria Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. In this update we included studies with more than 20 participants per arm. In this update, we included interventions that combined psychological and pharmacological treatments. We included comparison groups that received either non‐psychological treatment (e.g. psychoeducation), treatment as usual (e.g. standard medical care without added psychological therapy), or wait‐list. Data collection and analysis We extracted study characteristics and outcomes post‐treatment and at first available follow‐up. Primary outcomes were parenting behavior and parent mental health. Secondary outcomes were child behavior/disability, child mental health, child medical symptoms, and family functioning. We pooled data using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and a random‐effects model, and evaluated outcomes by medical condition and by therapy type. We assessed risk of bias per Cochrane guidance and quality of evidence using GRADE. Main results We added 21 new studies. We removed 23 studies from the previous update that no longer met our inclusion criteria. There are now 44 RCTs, including 4697 participants post‐treatment. Studies included children with asthma (4), cancer (7), chronic pain (13), diabetes (15), inflammatory bowel disease (2), skin diseases (1), and traumatic brain injury (3). Therapy types included cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT; 21), family therapy (4), motivational interviewing (3), multisystemic therapy (4), and problem‐solving therapy (PST; 12). We rated risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, except selective reporting bias, which we rated high for 19 studies due to incomplete outcome reporting. Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. We downgraded evidence due to high heterogeneity, imprecision, and publication bias. Evaluation of parent outcomes by medical condition Psychological therapies may improve parenting behavior (e.g. maladaptive or solicitous behaviors; lower scores are better) in children with cancer post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.43 to −0.13; participants = 664; studies = 3; SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.05; participants = 625; studies = 3; I 2  = 0%, respectively, low‐quality evidence), chronic pain post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.29, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.10; participants = 755; studies = 6; SMD −0.35, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.20; participants = 678; studies = 5, respectively, moderate‐quality evidence), diabetes post‐treatment (SMD −1.39, 95% CI −2.41 to −0.38; participants = 338; studies = 5, very low‐quality evidence), and traumatic brain injury post‐treatment (SMD −0.74, 95% CI −1.25 to −0.22; participants = 254; studies = 3, very low‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment. Psychological therapies may improve parent mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, lower scores are better) in children with cancer post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.08; participants = 836, studies = 6, high‐quality evidence; SMD −0.23, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.08; participants = 667; studies = 4, moderate‐quality evidence, respectively), and chronic pain post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.06; participants = 490; studies = 3; SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.02; participants = 482; studies = 3, respectively, low‐quality evidence). Parent mental health did not improve in studies of children with diabetes post‐treatment (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.90 to 0.42; participants = 211; studies = 3, very low‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses, data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment on parent mental health. Evaluation of parent outcomes by psychological therapy type CBT may improve parenting behavior post‐treatment (SMD −0.45, 95% CI −0.68 to −0.21; participants = 1040; studies = 9, low‐quality evidence), and follow‐up (SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.11; participants = 743; studies = 6, moderate‐quality evidence). We did not find evidence for a beneficial effect for CBT on parent mental health at post‐treatment or follow‐up (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.03; participants = 811; studies = 8; SMD −0.07, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.20; participants = 592; studies = 5; respectively, very low‐quality evidence). PST may improve parenting behavior post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.39, 95% CI −0.64 to −0.13; participants = 947; studies = 7, low‐quality evidence; SMD −0.54, 95% CI −0.94 to −0.14; participants = 852; studies = 6, very low‐quality evidence, respectively), and parent mental health post‐treatment and follow‐up (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.45 to −0.15; participants = 891; studies = 6; SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.07; participants = 800; studies = 5, respectively, moderate‐quality evidence). For the remaining analyses, data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of treatment on parent outcomes. Adverse events We could not evaluate treatment safety because most studies (32) did not report on whether adverse events occurred during the study period. In six studies, the authors reported that no adverse events occurred. The remaining six studies reported adverse events and none were attributed to psychological therapy. We rated the quality of evidence for adverse events as moderate. Authors conclusions Psychological therapy may improve parenting behavior among parents of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, and traumatic brain injury. We also found beneficial effects of psychological therapy may also improve parent mental health among parents of children with cancer and chronic pain. CBT and PST may improve parenting behavior. PST may also improve parent mental health. However, the quality of evidence is generally low and there are insufficient data to evaluate most outcomes. Our findings could change as new studies are conducted. Plain language summary Psychological therapies for parents of children and adolescents with a longstanding or life‐threatening physical illness Bottom line We found that psychological therapies may improve parenting behavior for parents of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes or traumatic brain injury, and may improve mental health of parents of children with cancer or chronic pain. Cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) and problem‐solving therapy (PST) are promising types of therapy. We were not able to answer questions about whether psychological therapies are helpful for parents of children with other medical conditions, or whether other types of therapy are helpful, because there were not enough data. Our findings may have been impacted by differences in measures used across studies. New studies may change the results of this review, and so our findings should be interpreted cautiously. Background We have updated our previously published review of psychological therapies for parents of children with a longstanding or life‐threatening physical illness to include studies published through July 2018. Parenting a child with a longstanding illness is challenging. Parents may have difficulty balancing caring for their child with other demands and can experience increased stress, sadness, or family conflict. Their children may have emotional or behavioral concerns. Parents can influence their childs adaptation to living with their medical condition. Psychological therapies for parents provide training in skills to modify emotions or behaviors that aim to improve parent, child, and family well‐being. We wanted to understand whether psychological therapies are helpful for parents of children and adolescents (up to age 19) with longstanding illness. We included studies of interventions that were predominantly psychological and delivered to parents compared with non‐psychological treatment, treatment as usual, or wait‐list. Outcomes were parenting behavior (e.g. protective behaviors), parent mental health, child behavior/disability, child mental health, child medical symptoms, family functioning, and side effects. Key results We added 21 new studies in this update and we removed 23 studies that no longer met our inclusion criteria, resulting in 44 randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trials, where participants are assigned randomly to either one treatment or a different treatment or no treatment, provide the most reliable evidence) with a total of 4697 participants (average child age = 11 years). The length of the studies ranged from one day to 24 months. Studies included children with asthma (4), cancer (7), chronic pain (recurrent or persistent pain for more than three months, including two studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease (15)), diabetes (15), skin diseases (1), and traumatic brain injury (3); one study included children with eczema and children with asthma. Therapy types included CBT (21), family therapy (4), motivational interviewing (3), multisystemic therapy (4), and PST (12). Funding sources included federal and local governments, hospitals, universities, and foundations. We found that parenting behavior improved in studies of children with cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, and traumatic brain injury immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term for parents of children with cancer and chronic pain. Parent mental health improved in studies of children with cancer and chronic pain immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term. Parent mental health did not improve in studies of children with diabetes. We found that CBT and PST improved parenting behavior immediately after treatment, which continued long‐term. PST also improved parent mental health immediately after treatment and long‐term, but CBT did not. We could not evaluate whether the other types of psychological therapy were beneficial for parents due to insufficient data. We found that these treatment effects were generally small. We found that most studies (32 studies) did not report on whether side effects occurred. In the few studies that did, none of the participants experienced side effects from psychological therapy. Quality of evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels"""

Whilst this intervention has become popular and its use has spread to several settings, empirical evidence for its efficacy is noticeably lacking. This is the third update of a review of single session psychological ""debriefing"", first having been undertaken in 1997. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of brief psychological debriefing for the management of psychological distress after trauma, and the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder. Search methods Electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, PILOTS, Biosis, Pascal, Occ.Safety and Health,SOCIOFILE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, PSYNDEX, SIGLE, LILACS, CCTR, CINAHL, NRR, Hand search of Journal of Traumatic Stress. Contact with leading researchers. Selection criteria The focus of RCTs was on persons recently (one month or less) exposed to a traumatic event. The intervention consisted of a single session only, and involved some form of emotional processing/ventilation, by encouraging recollection/reworking of the traumatic event, accompanied by normalisation of emotional reaction to the event. Data collection and analysis 15 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable, but the majority of trials scored poorly. Data from 6 trials could not be included the meta‐analyses. These trials are summarised in the text. Main results Single session individual debriefing did not prevent the onset of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nor reduce psychological distress, compared to control. At one year, one trial reported a significantly increased risk of PTSD in those receiving debriefing (OR 2.51 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.09). Those receiving the intervention reported no reduction in PTSD severity at 1‐4 months (SMD 0.11 (95%CI 0.10 to 0.32)), 6‐13 months (SMD 0.26 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.50)), or 3 years (SMD 0.17 (95%CI ‐0.34 to 0.67)). There was also no evidence that debriefing reduced general psychological morbidity, depression or anxiety, or that it was superior to an educational intervention. Authors\ conclusions There is no evidence that single session individual psychological debriefing is a useful treatment for the prevention of post traumatic stress disorder after traumatic incidents. Compulsory debriefing of victims of trauma should cease. A more appropriate response could involve a \screen and treat\ model (NICE 2005). Plain language summary Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) This review concerns the efficacy of single session psychological ""debriefing"" in reducing psychological distress and preventing the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events. Psychological debriefing is either equivalent to, or worse than, control or educational interventions in preventing or reducing the severity of PTSD, depression, anxiety and general psychological morbidity. There is some suggestion that it may increase the risk of PTSD and depression. The routine use of single session debriefing given to non selected trauma victims is not supported. No evidence has been found that this procedure is effective."

Search methods Electronic databases were searched for records to December 2011. We searched CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ISRCTN Register and clinicaltrials.gov. We examined reference lists of included RCTs and contacted authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in adults with diabetes and depression. Primary outcomes were depression and glycaemic control. Secondary outcomes were adherence to diabetic treatment regimens, diabetes complications, death from any cause, healthcare costs and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently examined the identified publications for inclusion and extracted data from included studies. Random‐effects model meta‐analyses were performed to compute overall estimates of treatment outcomes. Main results The database search identified 3963 references. Nineteen trials with 1592 participants were included. Psychological intervention studies (eight trials, 1122 participants, duration of therapy three weeks to 12 months, follow‐up after treatment zero to six months) showed beneficial effects on short (i.e. end of treatment), medium (i.e. one to six months after treatment) and long‐term (i.e. more than six months after treatment) depression severity (range of standardised mean differences (SMD) ‐1.47 to ‐0.14; eight trials). However, between‐study heterogeneity was substantial and meta‐analyses were not conducted. Short‐term depression remission rates (OR 2.88; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.58 to 5.25; P = 0.0006; 647 participants; four trials) and medium‐term depression remission rates (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.44 to 4.32; P = 0.001; 296 participants; two trials) were increased in psychological interventions compared to usual care. Evidence regarding glycaemic control in psychological intervention trials was heterogeneous and inconclusive. QoL did not improve significantly based on the results of three psychological intervention trials compared to usual care. Healthcare costs and adherence to diabetes and depression medication were examined in only one study and reliable conclusions cannot be drawn. Diabetes complications and death from any cause have not been investigated in the included psychological intervention trials. With regards to the comparison of pharmacological interventions versus placebo (eight trials; 377 participants; duration of intervention three weeks to six months, no follow‐up after treatment) there was a moderate beneficial effect of antidepressant medication on short‐term depression severity (all studies"

Siblings are often both natural agents to promote service users’ recovery and vulnerable to mental ill health due to the negative impact of psychosis within the family. Despite a wealth of research evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychoeducation for service users with SMI and their family members, in reducing relapse and promoting compliance with treatment, siblings remain relatively invisible in clinical service settings as well as in research studies. If psychoeducational interventions target siblings and improve siblings knowledge, coping with caring and overall wellbeing, they could potentially provide a cost‐effective option for supporting siblings with resulting benefits for service users outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of psychoeducation compared with usual care or any other intervention in promoting wellbeing and reducing distress of siblings of people affected by SMI. The secondary objective was, if possible, to determine which type of psychoeducation is most effective. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and screened the reference lists of relevant reports and reviews (12th November 2013). We contacted trial authors for unpublished and specific data on siblings outcomes. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on psychoeducational interventions targeting siblings of all ages (on their own or amongst other family members including service users) of individuals with SMI, using any means and formats of delivery, i.e. individual (family), groups, computer‐based. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the abstracts and extracted data and two other authors independently checked the screening and extraction process. We contacted authors of trials to ascertain siblings participation in the trials and seek sibling‐specific data in those studies where siblings data were grouped together with other participants (most commonly other family members/carers) outcomes. We calculated the risk difference (RD), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We presented continuous data using the mean difference statistic (MD) and 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and rated quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Main results We found 14 studies that included siblings amongst other family members in receipt of psychoeducational interventions. However, we were only able to include one small trial with relevant and available data (n = 9 siblings out of n = 84 family member/carer‐participants) comparing psychoeducational intervention with standard care in a community care setting, over a duration of 21 months. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on siblings quality of life (n = 9, MD score 3.80 95% CI ‐0.26 to 7.86,  low quality of evidence ), coping with (family) burden (n = 9, MD ‐8.80 95% CI ‐15.22 to ‐2.34,  low quality of evidence ). No sibling left the study early by one year (n = 9, RD 0.00 CI ‐0.34 to 0.34,  low quality of evidence ). Low quality and insufficient evidence meant we were unable to determine the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard care on service users global mental state (n = 9, MD ‐0.60 CI ‐3.54 to 2.38,  low quality of evidence ), their frequency of re‐hospitalisation (n = 9, MD ‐0.70 CI ‐2.46 to 1.06,  low quality of evidence ) or duration of inpatient stay (n = 9, MD ‐2.60 CI ‐6.34 to 1.14,  low quality of evidence ), whether their siblings received psychoeducation or not.

Psychoeducational approaches have been developed to increase patients knowledge of, and insight into, their illness and its treatment. It is supposed that this increased knowledge and insight will enable people with schizophrenia to cope in a more effective way with their illness, thereby improving prognosis. Objectives To assess the effects of psychoeducational interventions compared with standard levels of knowledge provision. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010). We updated this search November 2012 and added 27 new trials to the awaiting assessment section. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on psychoeducation for schizophrenia and/or related serious mental illnesses involving individuals or groups. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors extracted data independently from included papers. We contacted authors of trials for additional and missing data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data. We used a fixed‐effects model for heterogeneous dichotomous data. Where possible we also calculated the numbers needed to treat (NNT), as well as weighted means for continuous data. Main results This review includes a total of 5142 participants (mostly inpatients) from 44 trials conducted between 1988 and 2009 (median study duration ˜ 12 weeks, risk of bias ‐ moderate). We found that incidences of non‐compliance were lower in the psychoeducation group in the short term (n = 1400, RR 0.52 CI 0.40 to 0.67, NNT 11 CI 9 to 16). This finding holds for the medium and long term. Relapse appeared to be lower in psychoeducation group (n = 1214, RR 0.70 CI 0.61 to 0.81, NNT 9 CI 7 to 14) and this also applied to readmission (n = 206, RR 0.71 CI 0.56 to 0.89, NNT 5 CI 4 to 13). Scale‐derived data also suggested that psychoeducation promotes better social and global functioning. In the medium term, treating four people with schizophrenia with psychoeducation instead of standard care resulted in one additional person showing a clinical improvement. Evidence suggests that participants receiving psychoeducation are more likely to be satisfied with mental health services (n = 236, RR 0.24 CI 0.12 to 0.50, NNT 5 CI 5 to 8) and have improved quality of life. Authors conclusions Psychoeducation does seem to reduce relapse, readmission and encourage medication compliance, as well as reduce the length of hospital stay in these hospital‐based studies of limited quality. The true size of effect is likely to be less than demonstrated in this review ‐ but, nevertheless, some sort of psychoeducation could be clinically effective and potentially cost beneficial. It is not difficult to justify better, more applicable, research in this area aimed at fully investigating the effects of this promising approach. Note"""

These may take the form of telephone prompting, financial incentives or issuing a copy of the referral letter to the appointee. Objectives To estimate the effects of simple prompting by professional carers to encourage attendance at clinics for those with suspected serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2009) and reference lists, as well as contacting authors of studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria All relevant randomised (or quasi‐randomised) studies comparing the addition of prompts to standard care for those with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Prompts had the stated purpose of encouraging attendance or contact with mental health teams and could be text‐based, (for example in the form of a letter), electronic, by telephone call, by personal visit, or could employ financial or other rewards. Data collection and analysis Studies and data were independently selected and extracted. For homogeneous dichotomous data the random effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data the reviewers calculated weighted mean differences. Main results Only four relevant trials were identified (total n=789). It is not clear whether there is any real difference between attendance of those prompted by telephone one or two days before the appointment, and those given the standard appointment management system (2 RCTs, n=457, RR missed appointment 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.1). Text‐based prompts in the form of a letter, a few days before the appointment day, may increase clinic attendance when compared with no prompt (3 RCTs, n=326, RR missed appointment 0.76 CI 0.43 to 1.32). Only one small study (n=61) reported data on the combination of telephone and text‐based prompts versus no prompt, no real difference between groups was apparent (RR missed appointment 0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.2). When telephone prompts were compared with text‐based prompts (1 RCT, n=75), the latter, in the form of an orientation statement (a short paragraph, taking about 30 seconds to read, explaining the programme of care, the fee system, and providing gentle encouragement) may be somewhat more effective than the telephone prompt (RR missed appointment 1.9 CI 0.98 to 3.8). One study (n=120) compared a standard letter prompt with a letter orientation statement. Overall, results tended to favour the orientation statement approach rather than the simple letter prompting attendance but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (RR missed appointment 1.6 CI 0.9 to 2.9). When prompts were considered regardless of their type, the results were of greater significance and suggested an effect to increase the rate of attendance (RR missed appointments 0.80 CI 0.65 to 0.98). The inclusion of five new studies to the awaiting classification section may affect results when assessed. Authors conclusions There is evidence that a simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment may encourage attendance, and a simple orientation‐type letter may be more effective than a telephone prompt. This simple intervention could be a more cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance, but supplementing these data with the results of large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies would be desirable. Plain language summary Prompts to encourage appointment attendance for people with serious mental illness First appointments at a mental health clinic can be a daunting prospect. Failure to attend is common, wastes time, and can result in important delays in getting proper care. A gentle prompt, near to the time of appointment, would, if effective, seem a cost effective way of encouraging attendance. This review sought evidence for the effects of telephoning or sending a letter, in the days just before the appointment. Relevant studies were found, and although none were conclusive, all suggested that a simple prompt could indeed encourage attendance."""

It has an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth. Affected new mothers rapidly develop frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganised behaviours. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include primiparous mothers who are single, women who are older, or with a past psychiatric history and family history of affective psychosis, prenatal depression and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and hormone therapy may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk. Objectives To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the search strategy of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. If we had included relevant trials, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  Two review authors would have independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat to benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Main results There are no included studies in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned trials that seem never to have started, and one which we excluded a study because it was a report of a case series. Authors conclusions This is not an empty review ‐ it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite growing interest in women’s mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A  post hoc  PubMed topic (not methodology‐specific) search identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial‐based evidence upon which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well‐designed, well‐conducted, and well‐reported randomised studies. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority. Plain language summary Treatments to help prevent psychosis in women who have just given birth There is a small percentage of women for whom giving birth leads to psychosis. Postnatal psychosis affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers and is almost always a mood disorder accompanied by loss of contact with reality, hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations), having strange beliefs (delusions), severe thought disturbance, and abnormal behaviour. It can be a life‐threatening condition with an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth.\u2028 \u2028 Postnatal psychosis is more common in first time mothers and the risk is greater for mothers who are single or in older age. Risk is also greater in those with past mental health problems, family history of mental illness, depression before pregnancy and hormone problems. The most common symptoms of postnatal psychosis are feeling excited, elated or high, not needing to sleep or the inability to sleep, feeling active and talking more or feeling very chatty. Other women with postnatal psychosis may have severe depression with delusions, hearing voices, little or no speech, mental numbness and stupor. Such symptoms are themselves distressing but can also lead to harmful behaviours which include suicide, child neglect and abuse, or even in some extreme cases killing their child. Without treatment postnatal psychosis can last many months, but if women do receive modern therapy the symptoms usually resolve within a few weeks, reducing the risk of harm to both mother and baby.\u2028 As well as treatment, prevention could save the lives of both the mother and her baby, improve the mother‐baby relationship, and lead to better family relationships. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, the early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. \u2028 \u2028 This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis. Unfortunately, no studies were found that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on postnatal psychosis is much needed. Despite a growing interest in women’s mental health, knowledge and research on postnatal psychosis is still very limited. Future well‐designed, well‐conducted and well‐reported studies are necessary to help improve prevention of symptoms and treatment for women with postnatal psychosis.

This may lead to distress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration in quality of life and service provision. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of work‐ and person‐directed interventions compared to no intervention or alternative interventions in preventing stress at work in healthcare workers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC‐2 and Web of Science up to November 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers. For organisational interventions, interrupted time‐series and controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies were also eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used Standardised Mean Differences (SMDs) where authors of trials used different scales to measure stress or burnout. We combined studies that were similar in meta‐analyses. We used the GRADE system to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results In this update, we added 39 studies, making a total of 58 studies (54 RCTs and four CBA studies), with 7188 participants. We categorised interventions as cognitive‐behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisational interventions (n = 20). Follow‐up was less than one month in 24 studies, one to six in 22 studies and more than six months in 12 studies. We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health. There was low‐quality evidence that CBT with or without relaxation was no more effective in reducing stress symptoms than no intervention at one month follow‐up in six studies (SMD ‐0.27 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) ‐0.66 to 0.13; 332 participants). But at one to six months follow‐up in seven studies (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.16; 549 participants, 13% relative risk reduction), and at more than six months follow‐up in two studies (SMD ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.70; 157 participants) CBT with or without relaxation reduced stress more than no intervention. CBT interventions did not lead to a considerably greater effect than an alternative intervention, in three studies. Physical relaxation (e.g. massage) was more effective in reducing stress than no intervention at one month follow‐up in four studies (SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.89 to ‐0.08; 97 participants) and at one to six months follow‐up in six studies (SMD ‐0.47; 95% CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.24; 316 participants). Two studies did not find a considerable difference in stress between massage and taking extra breaks. Mental relaxation (e.g. meditation) led to similar stress symptom levels as no intervention at one to six months follow‐up in six studies (SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐1.15 to 0.15; 205 participants) but to less stress in one study at more than six months follow‐up. One study showed that mental relaxation reduced stress more effectively than attending a course on theory analysis and another that it was more effective than just relaxing in a chair. Organisational interventions consisted of changes in working conditions, organising support, changing care, increasing communication skills and changing work schedules. Changing work schedules (from continuous to having weekend breaks and from a four‐week to a two‐week schedule) reduced stress with SMD ‐0.55 (95% CI ‐0.84 to ‐0.25; 2 trials, 180 participants). Other organisational interventions were not more effective than no intervention or an alternative intervention. We graded the quality of the evidence for all but one comparison as low. For CBT this was due to the possibility of publication bias, and for the other comparisons to a lack of precision and risk of bias. Only for relaxation versus no intervention was the evidence of moderate quality. Authors conclusions There is low‐quality evidence that CBT and mental and physical relaxation reduce stress more than no intervention but not more than alternative interventions. There is also low‐quality evidence that changing work schedules may lead to a reduction of stress. Other organisational interventions have no effect on stress levels. More randomised controlled trials are needed with at least 120 participants that compare the intervention to a placebo‐like intervention. Organisational interventions need better focus on reduction of specific stressors. Plain language summary Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers Background Healthcare workers suffer from work‐related or occupational stress. Often this is because healthcare workers face high expectations and they may not have enough time, skills and social support at work. This can lead to severe distress, burnout or physical illness. In the end, healthcare workers may be unable to provide high quality healthcare services. Stress and burnout can also be costly because affected healthcare workers take sick leave and may even change jobs. We evaluated how well different ways to prevent healthcare workers stress or burnout work. Study characteristics We included 58 studies that included altogether 7188 participants. Fiftyfour of the included studies were randomised controlled studies and four were non‐randomised studies. We categorised the interventions as either cognitive‐behavioural training, mental and physical relaxation, or organisational changes. Key findings and quality of the evidence Cognitive‐behavioural interventions According to six studies, there was low‐quality evidence that cognitive‐behavioural training decreased stress with about 13% when compared to no intervention and when measured at follow‐up periods ranging from less than a month up to two years. It is unclear how relevant this reduction is for a person with stress. The results were similar when cognitive‐behavioural training was combined with relaxation. However, in three studies, stress levels were similar after a cognitive‐behavioural training course compared to other training that was not focused on stress management but on the content of care. Mental and physical relaxation interventions In 17 studies there was low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence that both mental and physical relaxation led to a reduction of 23% in stress levels compared to no intervention. Organisational interventions Organisational interventions were aimed at changing working conditions in 20 studies, improving support or mentoring in six studies, changing content of care in four studies, improving communication skills in one study and improving work schedules in two studies. Shorter or interrupted work schedules reduced stress levels in two studies but there was no clear benefit of any of the other organisational interventions. Conclusions We conclude that cognitive‐behavioural training as well as mental and physical relaxation all reduce stress moderately. Changing work schedules can also reduce stress, but other organisational interventions have no clear effects. We need randomised studies with at least 120 participants and preferably a single component intervention. Organisational interventions need to be better focused on addressing specific factors that cause stress."""

Objectives To assess the effectiveness of physical health monitoring, compared with standard care for people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (October 2009, update in October 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on physical health monitoring versus standard care, or comparing i) self monitoring versus monitoring by a healthcare professional; ii) simple versus complex monitoring; iii) specific versus non‐specific checks; iv) once only versus regular checks; or v) different guidance materials. Data collection and analysis Initially, review authors (GT, AC, SM) independently screened the search results and identified three studies as possibly fulfilling the reviews criteria. On examination, however, all three were subsequently excluded. Forty‐two additional citations were identified in October 2012 and screened by two review authors (JX and MW), 11 of which underwent full screening. Main results No relevant randomised trials which assess the effectiveness of physical health monitoring in people with serious mental illness have been completed. We identified one ongoing study. Authors conclusions There is still no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute current guidance and practice. Guidance and practice are based on expert consensus, clinical experience and good intentions rather than high quality evidence. Plain language summary Physical health care monitoring for people with serious mental illness People with mental health problems often have complex and long‐term difficulties with their physical health such as weight gain, smoking and heart problems. They sometimes do not take care of themselves, have inactive lifestyles and may not be able to cope with daily life or work. People with mental health problems have higher rates of diabetes, lung disease, cancer, heart problems, HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases. Physical health care monitoring can take a variety of forms from simple checks carried out by the person themselves to complex specific health checks carried out by health professionals. Monitoring helps identify current health problems and also anticipate future health problems. In August 2006 the United Kingdom’s Department of Health issued guidance on how to provide better care for the physical health needs of people with serious mental illness. Spearhead Trusts, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and other organisations all promoted the use of physical health care monitoring for people with mental health problems. This review intended to find evidence to support this guidance. The authors’ conclude that current guidance and practice on physical health monitoring lacks a firm basis in research and there is little evidence to support this growing trend. They based their conclusions on results from a search carried out for trials in 2012 which found no relevant randomised studies. Current monitoring is mainly based on the agreement of experts, medical experience and good intentions. This does not mean that physical health monitoring is invalid, wrong or not of benefit to the physical health of people with severe mental illness, only that there is as yet no definite proof. Physical health care monitoring has the potential and promise to improve quality of life and help people with mental health problems live longer, but at this stage the information is uncertain and the research evidence unclear.

Evidence that PTSD is characterised by specific psychobiological dysfunctions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medication in its treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of medication for post traumatic stress disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group specialised register (CCDANCTR‐Studies) on 18 August 2005, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), PsycINFO (1966 to 2004), and the National PTSD Center Pilots database. Reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for additional studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy for PTSD. Data collection and analysis Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by medication class, and by medication agent for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dichotomous and continuous measures were calculated using a random effects model, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Main results 35 short‐term (14 weeks or less) RCTs were included in the analysis (4597 participants). Symptom severity for 17 trials was significantly reduced in the medication groups, relative to placebo (weighted mean difference ‐5.76, 95% confidence intervals (CI) ‐8.16 to ‐3.36, number of participants (N) = 2507). Similarly, summary statistics for responder status from 13 trials demonstrated overall superiority of a variety of medication agents to placebo (relative risk 1.49, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.73, number needed to treat = 4.85, 95% CI 3.85 to 6.25, N = 1272). Medication and placebo response occurred in 59.1% (N = 644) and 38.5% (628) of patients, respectively. Of the medication classes, evidence of treatment efficacy was most convincing for the SSRIs. Medication was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptom clusters, comorbid depression and disability. Medication was also less well tolerated than placebo. A narrative review of 3 maintenance trials suggested that long term medication may be required in treating PTSD. Authors conclusions Medication treatments can be effective in treating PTSD, acting to reduce its core symptoms, as well as associated depression and disability. The findings of this review support the status of SSRIs as first line agents in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, as well as their value in long‐term treatment. However, there remain important gaps in the evidence base, and a continued need for more effective agents in the management of PTSD. Plain language summary Medication for post traumatic stress disorder Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after exposure to significant trauma and results in enormous personal and societal costs. Although traditionally treated with psychotherapy, there is increasing recognition of a theoretical basis for medication treatments. This was a systematic review of 35 short‐term randomised controlled trials of pharmacotherapy for PTSD (4597 participants). A significantly larger proportion of patients responded to medication (59.1%) than to placebo (38.5%) (13 trials, 1272 participants). Symptom severity was significantly reduced in 17 trials (2507 participants). The largest trials showing efficacy were of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with long‐term efficacy also observed for these medications."""

For patients on opioid agonist treatment, current prevalence rates of depression ranges between 10 and 30%, influencing negatively the outcome of the treatment. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid dependents treated with opioid agonists. Search methods We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL (to October 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, issue 4, 2009), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. Selection criteria Randomised and controlled clinical trials examining the efficacy of any antidepressant medication to treat depressed opioid dependents in treatment with opioid agonists. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. Main results Seven studies, 482 participants, met the inclusion criteria. ‐ Comparing antidepressant with placebo, no statistically significant results for dropouts. Selecting studies with low risk of bias, 325 participants, results favour placebo, RR 1.40 (Cl 95% 1.00 to 1.96). For severity of depression, results from two studies, 183 participants, favour antidepressants utilising Clinical Global Impression Scale RR 1.92 (CI 95% 1.26 to 2.94), while another study, 95 participants, utilising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, did not find a statistically significant difference RR 0.96 (CI 95% 0.54 to 1.71). For adverse events, result favour placebo, four studies, 311 participants, RR 2.90 (Cl 95% 1.23 to 6.86). For drug use, three studies, 211 participants, it was not possible to pool data because outcomes measures were not comparable. Looking at singular studies, no statistically significant difference was seen. ‐ Comparing different classes of antidepressants, the results favour tricyclics for severity of depression, two studies, 183 participants, RR 1.92 (Cl 95% 1.26 to 2.94) and favour placebo for adverse events, two studies, 172 participants, RR 3.11 (Cl 95% 1.06 to 9.12). Authors conclusions There is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of antidepressants for the treatment of depressed opioid addicts in treatment with opioid agonists. There is a need of larger randomised studies investigating relevant outcomes, safety issues and reporting data to allow comparison of results. Plain language summary Use of medication to treat depression in people with opioid dependence There is little evidence to support the use of antidepressants for treating people who are dependent on opioids and have clinical depression. Depression is more common in people with substance abuse and dependence than in the general population. The depression experienced is also associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. Depression may represent an independent disorder, the psychosocial stress associated with addictive behavior or it could be a consequence of drug use and drug withdrawal effects. A maintenance program with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM) is an effective treatment for people who are dependent on opioids in terms of retention in treatment and reduced use of opioids. Depression is however still prevalent and negatively impacts on treatment outcomes. Treatment with antidepressant drugs has therefore been proposed. These adjunct drug treatments include tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline). Authors included seven randomised controlled studies that involved 482 participants in our review. The studies were conducted in outpatient settings over four to 16 weeks; six were in USA and one in Australia. The mean age of participants was 34 years and 62% were males. No clear difference was found in the number of dropouts from an opioid agonist maintenance program between people receiving antidepressants and those in the placebo groups. Neither was drug use different (two studies). Severity of depression was reduced with the use of antidepressants (two studies), including tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse events were important as more of the participants who received antidepressants withdrew from the studies for medical reasons compared with those participants on placebo (four studies). The differences between studies in clinical (participant characteristics, the medications used, services and treatments delivered) and methodological characteristics (study design and quality) made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people who are dependent on opioids."""

Clozapine has been shown to impede gastrointestinal motility, leading to constipation, and has been reported in up to 60% of patients receiving clozapine. In rare cases, complications can be fatal. Appropriate laxatives should be prescribed to treat constipation in people taking antipsychotics, but there is a lack of guidance on the comparative effectiveness and harms of different agents in this population. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatment for antipsychotic‐related constipation is important for clinicians and patients alike. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic treatment (versus placebo or compared against another treatment) for antipsychotic‐related constipation (defined as constipated patients of any age, who are treated with antipsychotics, regardless of dose, in which constipation is considered to be an antipsychotic‐related side effect). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 June 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in this register. We also handsearched bibliographies and contacted relevant authors for additional information. Selection criteria We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in patients with antipsychotic‐related constipation. Pharmacological treatments included laxatives and other medicines that could reasonably be used to combat constipation in this population (e.g. anticholinergic agents, like bethanecol). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from all included studies and assessed trials for risk of bias. A third author reviewed 20% of trials. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a Summary of findings table. We discussed any disagreement, documented decisions, and attempted to contact study authors when necessary. Main results We identified two relevant Chinese studies (N = 480) that contributed data to this review. Both studies were over ten years old and poorly reported, lacking descriptions of contemporary CONSORT reporting prerequisites, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, participant flow, how the sample size was determined, or how outcomes were measured. The studies also did not report trial registration, pre‐specified protocols, consent processes, ethical review, or funding source. We were unsuccessful in making contact with the authors to clarify the missing details. We classified both studies as having an overall high risk of bias. One study compared glycerol suppository with the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approaches of tuina massage and acupuncture. Compared to tuina massage, glycerol laxative was less effective in relieving constipation at both two days after treatment (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.39; very low‐quality evidence), and three days (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 4.80, CI 1.96 to 11.74, very low‐quality evidence). Favourable results were also seen for acupuncture at two days (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 3.50; 95% CI 2.18 to 5.62; very low‐quality evidence), and at three days (1 RCT; N = 120; RR 8.00, 95% CI 2.54 to 25.16; very low‐quality evidence). The other study compared mannitol, an osmotic laxative, with rhubarb soda or phenolphthalein. Mannitol was more effective than rhubarb soda or phenolphthalein in trelieving constipation within 24 hours of treatment (1 RCT; N = 240; RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27, very low‐quality evidence). No data were reported for our other important outcomes"""

However, this major comorbidity in COPD is rarely managed effectively. A number of recent studies indicate that left untreated, COPD‐related depression is associated with worse quality of life, worse compliance with COPD treatment plan, increased exacerbations, hospital admissions, and healthcare costs when compared to individuals with COPD without depression. Regrettably, COPD practice guidelines do not provide conclusive treatment recommendations for the use of antidepressants in patients with COPD, and base their guidelines on findings from trials in the general population. This may be problematic, as there is an elevated risk of respiratory issues associated with antidepressant treatment and COPD. Evaluating effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions specifically for patients with COPD and depression was therefore paramount.

Although different medications are part of treatment routines for people with somatoform disorders in clinics and private practices, there exists no systematic review or meta‐analysis on the efficacy and tolerability of these medications. We aimed to synthesise to improve optimal treatment decisions. Objectives To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for somatoform disorders (specifically somatisation disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, somatoform autonomic dysfunction, and pain disorder) in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Groups Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 17 January 2014). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from  The Cochrane Library  (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). To identify ongoing trials, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials  meta Register, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry. For grey literature, we searched ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database, OpenGrey, and BIOSIS Previews. We handsearched conference proceedings and reference lists of potentially relevant papers and systematic reviews and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We selected RCTs or cluster RCTs of pharmacological interventions versus placebo, treatment as usual, another medication, or a combination of different medications for somatoform disorders in adults. We included people fulfilling standardised diagnostic criteria for somatisation disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, somatoform autonomic dysfunction, or somatoform pain disorder. Data collection and analysis One review author and one research assistant independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes included the severity of MUPS on a continuous measure, and acceptability of treatment. Main results We included 26 RCTs (33 reports), with 2159 participants, in the review. They examined the efficacy of different types of antidepressants, the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, antipsychotics alone, or natural products (NPs). The duration of the studies ranged between two and 12 weeks. One meta‐analysis of placebo‐controlled studies showed no clear evidence of a significant difference between tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and placebo for the outcome severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.13; 95% CI ‐0.39 to 0.13; 2 studies, 239 participants; I 2  = 2%; low‐quality evidence). For new‐generation antidepressants (NGAs), there was very low‐quality evidence showing they were effective in reducing the severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.91; 95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.46; 3 studies, 243 participants; I 2  = 63%). For NPs there was low‐quality evidence that they were effective in reducing the severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.74; 95% CI ‐0.97 to ‐0.51; 2 studies, 322 participants; I 2  = 0%). One meta‐analysis showed no clear evidence of a difference between TCAs and NGAs for severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.16; 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.23; 3 studies, 177 participants; I 2  = 42%; low‐quality evidence). There was also no difference between NGAs and other NGAs for severity of MUPS (SMD ‐0.16; 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.14; 4 studies, 182 participants; I 2  = 0%). Finally, one meta‐analysis comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with a combination of SSRIs and antipsychotics showed low‐quality evidence in favour of combined treatment for severity of MUPS (SMD 0.77; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.22; 2 studies, 107 participants; I 2  = 23%). Differences regarding the acceptability of the treatment (rate of all‐cause drop‐outs) were neither found between NGAs and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.61; 2 studies, 163 participants; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence) or NPs and placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.78; 3 studies, 506 participants; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence); nor between TCAs and other medication (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.72; 8 studies, 556 participants; I 2  =14%; low‐quality evidence); nor between antidepressants and the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.52; 2 studies, 118 participants; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Percental attrition rates due to adverse effects were high in all antidepressant treatments (0% to 32%), but low for NPs (0% to 1.7%). The risk of bias was high in many domains across studies. Seventeen trials (65.4%) gave no information about random sequence generation and only two (7.7%) provided information about allocation concealment. Eighteen studies (69.2%) revealed a high or unclear risk in blinding participants and study personnel; 23 studies had high risk of bias relating to blinding assessors. For the comparison NGA versus placebo, there was relatively high imprecision and heterogeneity due to one outlier study. Although we identified 26 studies, each comparison only contained a few studies and small numbers of participants so the results were imprecise. Authors conclusions The current review found very low‐quality evidence for NGAs and low‐quality evidence for NPs being effective in treating somatoform symptoms in adults when compared with placebo. There was some evidence that different classes of antidepressants did not differ in efficacy; however, this was limited and of low to very low quality. These results had serious shortcomings such as the high risk of bias, strong heterogeneity in the data, and small sample sizes. Furthermore, the significant effects of antidepressant treatment have to be balanced against the relatively high rates of adverse effects. Adverse effects produced by medication can have amplifying effects on symptom perceptions, particularly in people focusing on somatic symptoms without medical causes. We can only draw conclusions about short‐term efficacy of the pharmacological interventions because no trial included follow‐up assessments. For each of the comparisons where there were available data on acceptability rates (NGAs versus placebo, NPs versus placebo, TCAs versus other medication, and antidepressants versus a combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic), no clear differences between the intervention and comparator were found. Future high‐quality research should be carried out to determine the effectiveness of medications other than antidepressants, to compare antidepressants more thoroughly, and to follow‐up participants over longer periods (the longest follow up was just 12 weeks). Another idea for future research would be to include other outcomes such as functional impairment or dysfunctional behaviours and cognitions as well as the classical outcomes such as symptom severity, depression, or anxiety.

Sinus tachycardia is a common adverse event associated with clozapine treatment. Various pharmacological treatments are used to control heart rate increase due to clozapine use and can include a decreased rate of clozapine titration, a switch to a different antipsychotic, or treatment with negative chronotropic drugs. Objectives To assess the clinical effects and efficacy of pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia. To systematically review the adverse events associated with pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia. Search methods On 23 March 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions, at any dose and by any route of administration, for clozapine‐induced tachycardia. Data collection and analysis We independently screened and assessed studies for inclusion using pre‐specified inclusion criteria. Main results The electronic searches located three references. However, we did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Authors conclusions With no studies meeting the inclusion criteria, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. There are currently insufficient data to confidently inform clinical practice. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether specific interventions, such as beta‐blockers, are less effective or more effective than standard courses of alternative treatments for tachycardia. This lack of evidence for the treatment of clozapine‐induced tachycardia has implications for research and practice. Well‐planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated. One trial is currently underway. Current practice outside of well‐designed randomised trials should be clearly justified. Plain language summary Pharmacological interventions for clozapine‐induced sinus tachycardia Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Clozapine is the only treatment proven to be effective for those people who do not respond to other antipsychotic medications. A fast pulse rate (tachycardia) is one of the more common side effects associated with clozapine use. It is reported to occur in 25 out of every 100 people treated with clozapine. The occurrence of a fast pulse rate may lead to palpitations in the person treated with clozapine, which can be unpleasant and worrying. A fast pulse rate by itself is not necessarily dangerous to the person and can be treated. There are medications available to treat a fast pulse rate and slow it down to a normal rate. Examples of such medications include beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers. However, a fast pulse rate can lead to clozapine being stopped by doctors. This review is about ways to reduce this problem, to find out if any treatment for a fast heart rate with clozapine use is better than another. This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at treating a fast heart rate associated with clozapine treatment. Unfortunately, we found no studies that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on the treatment is much needed. Finding answers to this question will aid people treated with clozapine, and their doctors, in ensuring that a fast heart rate with clozapine can be treated and that clozapine can be safely continued."""

Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between the various first‐generation antipsychotics, however, low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs are sometimes perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency first‐generation compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. Objectives To review the effects of high‐potency, first‐generation perphenazine compared with low‐potency, first‐generation antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (October 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perphenazine with first‐generation, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis and using a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes four relevant randomised trials with 365 participants. The size of the included studies was between 42 and 158 participants with a study length between one and four months. Overall, the methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. Most studies were rated as low risk of bias in terms of blinding. Overall, attrition bias in the studies was high. The effects of perphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotic drugs seemed to be similar in terms of the primary outcome – response to treatment (perphenazine 58%, low‐potency antipsychotics 59%, 2 RCTs, n = 138, RR 0.97 CI 0.74 to 1.26 –  moderate quality of evidence ). There was also no clear evidence of a difference in acceptability of treatment with the number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason, however results were imprecise (perphenazine 30%, low‐potency antipsychotics 28%, 3 RCTs, n = 323, RR 0.78 CI 0.35 to 1.76,  very low quality of evidence ). There were low numbers of studies available for the outcomes experiencing at least one adverse effect (perphenazine 33%, low‐potency antipsychotics 47%, 2 RCTs, n = 165, RR 0.83 CI 0.36 to 1.95,  low quality evidence ) and experiencing at least one movement disorder (perphenazine 22%, low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics 0%, 1 RCT, n = 69, RR 15.62 CI 0.94 to 260.49,  low quality evidence ), and the confidence intervals for the estimated effects did not exclude important differences. Akathisia was more frequent in the perphenazine group (perphenazine 25%, low‐potency antipsychotics 22%, 2 RCTs, n = 227, RR 9.45 CI 1.69 to 52.88), whereas severe toxicity was less so (perphenazine 42%, low‐potency antipsychotics 69%, 1 RCT, n = 96, RR 0.61 CI 0.41 to 0.89). There were three deaths in the low‐potency group by four months but the difference between groups was not significant (perphenazine 0%, low‐potency antipsychotics 2%, 1 RCT, n = 96, RR 0.14 CI 0.01 to 2.69,  moderate quality evidence ). No data were available for our prespecified outcomes of interest sedation or quality of life. Data were not available for other outcomes such as relapse, service use, costs and satisfaction with care. The event rates reported quote simple aggregates and are not based on the RRs. Authors conclusions The results do not show a superiority in efficacy of high‐potency perphenazine compared with low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics. There is some evidence that perphenazine is more likely to cause akathisia and less likely to cause severe toxicity, but most adverse effect results were equivocal. The number of studies as well as the quality of studies is low, with quality of evidence for the main outcomes ranging from moderate to very low, so more randomised evidence would be needed for conclusions to be made. Plain language summary Perphenazine versus low‐potency first‐generation drugs for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness where people experience ‘positive symptoms’ (such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs) and ‘negative symptoms’ (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia and can be grouped into older drugs (‘typical’ or first‐generation) and newer drugs (‘atypical’ or second‐generation), and within these groups you can have low strength (low‐potency) or high strength (high‐potency) antipsychotics. Perphenazine is a high‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic. Low‐potency antipsychotics are often seen by psychiatrists and health professionals as less effective in treating schizophrenia than high‐potency antipsychotic drugs; they also differ in side effects. Low‐potency antipsychotic drugs often cause sleepiness and low blood pressure whereas high‐potency antipsychotic drugs often produce movement disorders such as restlessness, shaking and tremors. Typical examples of low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine or levomepromazine. The review aims to compare a high‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic, perphenazine with low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics. A search for trials was run in 2010. Four trials that randomised a total of 365 people are included. The studies compared perphenazine with chlorpromazine, thioridazine and levomepromazine. Overall, the trials were of poor quality, poorly reported and small scale. Review authors also rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes to range from moderate to very low quality. It was found that perphenazine was not obviously clinically superior to low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotic drugs but was more likely cause the movement disorder akathisia (inner restlessness and the inability to sit still). Low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics are thought more likely to cause side effects such as sedation and hypotension but evidence from this review showed people taking perphenazine were just as likely to experience hypotension as those taking first‐generation antipsychotics and no data were available for sedation. Other outcomes, such as re‐hospitalisation, costs, healthy days and quality of life were not addressed in the studies. No firm conclusions can be made about perphenazines superiority or inferiority over low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics until newer and better conducted studies are completed.

It has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan. Objectives To examine the clinical effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We updated our original search using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register (September 2013), references of all included studies and contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of included studies in order to identify further trials. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials that compared perphenazine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. We excluded trials of depot formulations of perphenazine. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts. We ordered papers, inspected and quality assessed them. We extracted data, again working independently. If loss to follow‐up was greater than 50% we considered results as prone to bias. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and for continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD), both with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed quality of data using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluationtool) and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results Thirty‐one studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with a total of 4662 participants (of which 4522 were receiving the drugs relevant to our comparison) and presented data that could be used for at least one comparison. The trial centres were located in Europe (especially Scandinavia), Japan and Northern America. When comparing perphenazine with placebo, for our primary outcome of clinical response, results favoured perphenazine with significantly more people receiving placebo rated as either no better or deterioration for global state than people receiving perphenazine (1 RCT, n = 61 RR 0.32 CI 0.13 to 0.78,  very low quality evidence ). More people receiving placebo relapsed, although not a statistically significant number (1 RCT, n = 48, RR 0.14 CI 0.02 to 1.07,  very low quality evidence ). Death was not reported in the perphenazine versus placebo comparison. Experiences of dystonia were equivocal between groups (1 RCT, n = 48, RR 1.00 CI 0.07 to 15.08,  very low quality evidence ); other outcomes not reported in this comparison include serious adverse events, economic outcomes, and service use and hospitalisation. For the comparison of perphenazine versus any other antipsychotic drugs, no real differences in effect between the drugs were found. There was no significant difference between groups for those considered no better or deterioration (17 RCTs, n = 1879, RR 1.04 CI 0.91 to 1.17,  very low quality evidence ). For mental state outcome of no effect of the study drug, there was again no significant difference between groups (4 RCTs, n = 383, RR 1.24 CI 0.61 to 2.52,  very low quality evidence ). Death was not reported in any of the included studies. There was no significant difference in rates of dystonia with perphenazine versus any other antipsychotic drugs (4 RCTs, n = 416, RR 1.36 CI 0.23 to 8.16,  very low quality evidence ), nor was there a significant difference between groups for serious adverse events (2 RCTs, n = 1760, RR 0.98 CI 0.68 to 1.41,  very low quality evidence ). Authors conclusions Although perphenazine has been used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparators used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions. All data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence. At best we can say that perphenazine showed similar effects and adverse events as several of the other antipsychotic drugs. Since perphenazine is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used compound, further trials are justified to clarify the properties of this classical antipsychotic drug. Plain language summary Perphenazine for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Perphenazine is an old antipsychotic drug (typical or first‐generation) formulated in the 1950s with an effectiveness similar to another antipsychotic drug called haloperidol. Perphenazine is particularly popular in Northern European countries and Japan. The aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness and safety of perphenazine for schizophrenia. A search for relevant randomised studies was run in September 2013. The review authors included 31 studies that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either perphenazine or placebo or another antipsychotic drug. A total of 4662 people participated in these studies. The quality of evidence presented by the trials was rated by the review authors to be very low quality. It was found that perphenazine was no better or worse than other older antipsychotic drugs in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, and like other older antipsychotic drugs, the side effects of perphenazine included tremors, uncontrollable shaking, the inability to sit still and feeling restless. Although perphenazine has been used for more than 50 years, poor studies with bad reporting of information mean that it is difficult to draw more clear findings and conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of perphenazine. However, perphenazine is inexpensive and a popular antipsychotic drug in many countries, so further research and trials on its effectiveness and safety are much needed.

It is overall pharmacologically similar with chlorpromazine, though particularly sedating. Dopamine receptor subtype analysis has not been performed for pericyazine, but the drug appears to induce greater noradrenergic than dopaminergic blockade. Compared to chlorpromazine, pericyazine reportedly has more potent antiemetic, antiserotonin, and anticholinergic activity. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effects and safety of pericyazine in comparison with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and standard care for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2013) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials focusing on pericyazine for schizophrenia and other types of schizophrenia‐like psychoses (schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders). We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently from included papers by at least two review authors. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were calculated. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge quality of evidence. Main results We could only include five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980. Most of the included studies did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, details of blinding and we could not assess the impact of attrition due to poor reporting. For the primary outcome of Global state ‐ not improved, the confidence interval was compatible with a small benefit and increased risk of not improving with pericyazine compared with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 122, RR 1.24 CI 0.93 to 1.66,  very low quality of evidence ) or atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.97 CI 0.67 to 1.42,  very low quality of evidence ). When compared with typical antipsychotics relapse was only experienced by one person taking pericyazine (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 2.59 CI 0.11 to 61.75,  very low quality of evidence ). Pericyazine was associated with more extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics (3 RCTs, n = 163, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80,  very low quality of evidence ) and atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 2.69 CI 1.35 to 5.36,  very low quality of evidence ). The estimated risk of leaving the study early for specific reasons was imprecise for the comparisons of pericyazine with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 71, RR 0.46 CI 0.11 to 1.90,  very low quality of evidence ), and with atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.13 CI 0.01 to 2.42,  very low quality of evidence ). Authors conclusions On the basis of very low quality evidence we are unable to determine the effects of pericyazine in comparison with typical or atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, there is some evidence that pericyazine may be associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than other antipsychotics, and again this was judged to be  very low quality  evidence. Large, robust studies are still needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Plain language summary Pericyazine for the treatment of schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The first line and mainstay of treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. These antipsychotic drugs can be grouped into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). Pericyazine is a relatively old antipsychotic formulated in 1961. Some studies have suggested that it may be of more benefit than other antipsychotic drugs. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of pericyazine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared to older and newer antipsychotics.A search for studies was carried out in 2013 and five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980 were found and included in the review. The quality of evidence was rated by the authors to be  very low , and their results were imprecise for many outcomes where they compared pericyazine and other older and newer antipsychotic drugs. The evidence is inadequate to determine whether pericyazine is better than other antipsychotics. The results of the analysis for the outcome of improvement were imprecise and the authors could not be certain that more people who took pericyazine were found to have not improved compared with those who took typical antipsychotics. More side effects, such as involuntary shaking, tremors, restlessness and spasms, were experienced by people who took pericyazine than other typical or atypical antipsychotics. These side effects are very unpleasant and the increased occurrence of them compared to other antipsychotics is an important finding considering pericyazine may not have additional benefits for the symptoms of schizophrenia. No studies reported outcomes on satisfaction of treatment or cost effectiveness, which require attention. This lack of evidence leaves people with schizophrenia, mental health professionals and policy makers with little information on the benefits, hazards or problems of pericyazine. Outcomes on the cost of care and satisfaction with treatment should be included in future trials which should also be larger, better conducted, and fully reported.

As far as we are aware, its use is limited to Germany, Poland, the former Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. Objectives To examine the effects of perazine for those with schizophrenia or related psychoses in comparison with placebo, no treatment or other antipsychotic medications. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases Biological Abstracts, CINAHL,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, LILACS, PSYNDEX, Sociological Abstracts and Sociofile. We searched the references of all included studies for further trials. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials. We updated this search on 16th July 2012. Selection criteria We selected all randomised controlled trials that compared perazine with other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses, or both. Data collection and analysis The review authors (SL, BH, BHe) independently inspected the citations and where possible abstracts and ordered papers for re‐inspection and quality assessment. We independently extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We inspected all data for heterogeneity, assessed trials for risk of bias and created summary of findings tables using GRADE. Main results The review now includes seven trials with a total of 479 participants. In only one trial, with 95 participants, perazine appeared superior to active placebo (trimipramine) at five weeks for the outcome of no important global improvement (n = 95, RR 0.43 CI 0.2 to 0.8,  low quality evidence ), but there was no statistically significant difference in most measures of mental state. Perazine did not induce more general adverse events than placebo but more participants received at least one dose of antiparkinson medication (n = 95, RR 4.50 CI 1.0 to 19.5,  very low quality evidence ). Six small trials comparing perazine with other antipsychotics, including 384 participants in total, were incompletely reported and the outcomes were presented in various ways so that meta‐analysis was not possible on most occasions. In the six studies, a similar number of participants receiving perazine or comparator antipsychotics (amisulpride, haloperidol, olanzapine, ziprasidone, zotepine) left the studies early (n = 384, RR 0.97 CI 0.68 to 1.38,  low quality evidence ). The results on efficacy could not be meta‐analysed because the authors presented their results in very different ways. No obvious differences in adverse events between perazine and other antipsychotics could be derived from the limited data. Two haloperidol comparisons did not present extrapyramidal side‐effects in a way that was suitable for use in meta‐analysis, but three small comparisons with the second‐generation antipsychotics zotepine and amisulpride showed no higher risk of akathisia (n = 111, RR 0.31 CI 0.1 to 1.1), dyskinesia (n = 111, RR 0.47 CI 0.1 to 3.5), parkinsonism (n = 81, RR 1.21 CI 0.5 2.8) or tremor (n = 40, RR 0.80 CI 0.3 to 2.6) with perazine. Authors conclusions The number, size and reporting of randomised controlled perazine trials are insufficient to present firm conclusions about the properties of this antipsychotic. It is possible that perazine is associated with a similar risk of extrapyramidal side‐effects as some atypical antipsychotics but this is based on small comparisons. This should be clarified in larger, well‐designed trials. Plain language summary Perazine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is often a severe and disabling illness that affects approximately one per cent of the worldwide population. Schizophrenia has positive symptoms, such as strange and fixed beliefs (delusions), as well as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations). Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms such as apathy, loss of emotion, lack of drive and disorganisation of behaviour and thought. The degree of disability is considerable with 80% ‐ 90% not working and up to 10% dying. Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, and are grouped into older drugs (first generation or ‘typical’) and newer drugs (second generation or ‘atypical’). However, antipsychotic drugs also have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders such as uncontrollable shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness, tiredness, weight gain and the inability to sit still. Perazine is an older antipsychotic drug first introduced in the 1950s. It is suggested to have a low level of side effects (especially for movement disorders). Its use is regional and restricted to countries like Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. A search for trials was carried out in July 2012. The review now includes seven studies with a total of 479 participants and assesses the effects of perazine for people with schizophrenia. Comparisons of perazine versus placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) and versus other antipsychotic drugs revealed no clear differences or superiority of perazine. However, only a handful of studies have been undertaken and the number of participants in each study was small. In addition the studies avialable were of limited quality with data for the main outcomes of interest rated as low or very low quality. As perazine is a cheap drug and there is some limited evidence that it may cause less side effects than other older antipsychotic drugs, further large scale, well designed and well‐reported studies are much needed.

Advanced dementia is characterised by profound cognitive impairment, inability to communicate verbally and complete functional dependence. Usual care of people with advanced dementia is not underpinned universally by a palliative approach. Palliative care has focused traditionally on care of people with cancer but for more than a decade, there have been increased calls worldwide to extend palliative care services to include all people with life‐limiting illnesses in need of specialist care, including people with dementia. Objectives To assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia and to report on the range of outcome measures used. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups Specialized Register on 4 February 2016. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP trial portal to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible. Selection criteria We searched for randomised (RCT) and non‐randomised controlled trials (nRCT), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series studies evaluating the impact of palliative care interventions for adults with dementia of any type, staged as advanced dementia by a recognised and validated tool. Participants could be people with advanced dementia, their family members, clinicians or paid care staff. We included clinical interventions and non‐clinical interventions. Comparators were usual care or another palliative care intervention. We did not exclude studies on the basis of outcomes measured and recorded all outcomes measured in included studies. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, when required, consulted with the rest of the review team. We independently extracted data and conducted assessment of methodological quality, using standard Cochrane methods. Main results We identified two studies of palliative care interventions for people with advanced dementia. We did not pool data due to the heterogeneity between the two trials in terms of the interventions and the settings. The two studies measured 31 different outcomes, yet they did not measure the same outcome. There are six ongoing studies that we expect to include in future versions of this review. Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible. This and small sample sizes meant that the overall certainty of all the evidence was very low. One individually randomised RCT (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a palliative care team for people with advanced dementia hospitalised for an acute illness. While this trial reported that a palliative care plan was more likely to be developed for participants in the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 25.02), the plan was only adopted for two participants, both in the intervention group, while in hospital. The palliative care plan was more likely to be available on discharge in the intervention group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75). We found no evidence that the intervention affected mortality in hospital (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13), decisions to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital or the clinical care provided during hospital admission, but for the latter, event rates were low and the results were associated with a lot of uncertainty. One cluster RCT (256 participants, each enrolled with a family carer) evaluated the effect of a decision aid on end‐of‐life feeding options on surrogate decision‐makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Data for 90 participants (35% of the original study) met the definition of advanced dementia for this review and were re‐analysed for the purposes of the review. In this subset, intervention surrogates had lower scores for decisional conflict measured on the Decisional Conflict Scale (mean difference ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.01, reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units considered meaningful) and were more likely than participants in the control group to discuss feeding options with a clinician (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64), but imprecision meant that there was significant uncertainty about both results. Authors conclusions Very little high quality work has been completed exploring palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. There were only two included studies in this review, with variation in the interventions and in the settings that made it impossible to conduct a meta‐analysis of data for any outcome. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. The fact that there are six ongoing studies at the time of this review indicates an increased interest in this area by researchers, which is welcome and needed. Plain language summary Palliative care for people with advanced dementia Review question In this research, we wanted to see if palliative care helps people with advanced dementia or helps their family or carers. We also wanted to describe how researchers tried to measure the effect of palliative care. Background People with advanced dementia have serious memory problems and have problems making simple decisions. They are usually no longer able to communicate by talking. They need a lot of help from their carers. People with advanced dementia can live for a long time. It is very hard to say exactly how long a person with advanced dementia will live. Palliative care (or end‐of‐life care) is a particular way of caring for people who have diseases that cannot be cured. The main aims of palliative care are to reduce pain and to maintain the best possible quality of life as death approaches. Palliative care is used a lot with people with cancer but is not used much for people with advanced dementia. Study characteristics We examined the research published up to January 2016. We found only two suitable studies (189 people), both from the US. We also found six studies that were underway but the results were not yet published. Key results One study found that having a small team of doctors and nurses trained in palliative care made little difference to how people with advanced dementia were treated while in hospital. But, having this special team meant that more people had a palliative care plan when they were discharged from hospital. The other study measured if giving written information to relatives explaining the different methods that can be used to feed people with advanced dementia helped either the relatives or the person. This study found that giving relatives this information made it a little easier for relatives to make decisions about what methods would be used to feed the person with dementia. Certainty of evidence We only found two studies and the two palliative care methods in these studies were very different. We cannot be very certain about how accurate either of these results reported here are, partly because only a small number of people took part in the studies. So from these studies, it is hard to be sure whether palliative care makes a difference to people with advanced dementia. Final thoughts Little research has been done about people with advanced dementia, often because of ethical concerns. However, although it is hard to do research with people with dementia, more well‐designed studies are required to work out how palliative care can be used best in this special population."""

Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone and it is also available in an oral formulation for daily use. Objectives To compare the effects of paliperidone palmitate with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (November 2009) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone palmitate, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data collection and analysis We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to benefit/harm statistic (NNB/H). We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous data. Main results Five studies with 2215 participants compared paliperidone palmitate with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone palmitate (n = 2183, 5 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.70 to 0.84, NNTB 9 CI 7 to 14) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to show no improvement in global state (n = 1696, 4 RCTs, RR 0.79 CI 0.74 to 0.85, NNTB 7 CI 5 to 9). People randomised to paliperidone palmitate were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n = 312, 1 RCT, RR 0.28 CI 0.17 to 0.48, NNTB 5 CI 4 to 6) than those allocated to placebo in a single trial specifically designed to study recurrence. In the other studies where recurrence was recorded only as an adverse event, we found that people who received paliperidone palmitate were also less likely to experience a recurrence of psychotic symptoms (n = 1837, 4 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.44 to 0.68, NNTB 10 CI 8 to 14).  Paliperidone palmitate was associated with fewer reports of agitation or aggression (n = 2180, 5 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.46 to 0.91, NNTB 39 CI 25 to 150) and of using anxiolytic medications (n = 2170, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.83 to 0.96, NNTB 16 CI 11 to 44). A consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) was found for both men and women receiving paliperidone palmitate, but the data were too heterogenous to sum. We found no evidence of sexual dysfunction in these short‐term trials. People receiving paliperidone palmitate had a significantly greater increase in weight (n = 2052, 5 RCTs, MD 1.34 CI 0.97 to 1.70) in comparison with people who received placebo. Two studies with 1969 participants compared flexibly‐dosed paliperidone palmitate with flexibly‐dosed risperidone long‐acting injection. The mean doses of paliperidone palmitate in these trials were 73.3 and 104.6 mg every four weeks compared with risperidone long‐acting injection at mean doses, respectively, of 35.3 and 31.7 mg every two weeks. We found no differences between paliperidone palmitate and risperidone long‐acting injection for leaving these studies early for any reason (n = 1969, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 1.00 to 1.25). Those receiving paliperidone palmitate were statistically no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving risperidone long‐acting injection (n = 1961, 2 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 0.98 to 1.53). While we found no significant difference in the occurrences of deaths in the pooled trials (n = 1967, 2 RCTs, RR 3.62 CI 0.60 to 21.89), we note that a total of six deaths occurred in these two trials, with five deaths among people who received paliperidone palmitate and one death among people who received risperidone long‐acting injection. Although death is the most serious of adverse events, the small number of these events in these trials makes it unclear if this finding is meaningful. We found that participants randomised to paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to use anticholinergic medications in these trials (n = 1587, 2 RCTs, RR 0.67 CI 0.55 to 0.82, NNTB 13 CI 10 to 24). \u2028 \u2028 We found no data regarding paliperidone palmitate relating to services use, quality of life, behaviour, patient satisfaction, cognitive functioning or cost. Authors conclusions In short‐term studies, paliperidone palmitate is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its related compounds, paliperidone and risperidone, with extrapyramidal movement disorders, weight gain, and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone palmitate than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone palmitate is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When flexibly dosed with a mean doses of approximately 70 to 110 mg every four weeks, paliperidone palmitate appears comparable in efficacy and tolerability to risperidone long‐acting injection flexibly dosed with mean doses of approximately 35 mg every two weeks.   Plain language summary Paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia Paliperidone palmitate is a long‐acting intramuscular formulation of paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone that was previously available only in an oral formulation. We evaluated the efficacy, adverse effects, and safety of paliperidone palmitate in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. In short‐term studies, paliperidone palmitate is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone palmitate are similar to those of oral paliperidone, oral risperidone, and risperidone long‐acting injection. In two short‐term studies, flexibly‐dosed paliperidone palmitate is roughly equivalent in efficacy and tolerability to flexibly‐dosed risperidone long‐acting injection."""

This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational‐level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work‐related stress in teachers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and controlled before‐and‐after studies of organisational‐level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster‐randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped‐wedge design. Changing task characteristics One study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task‐based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from ‐3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low‐quality evidence). Changing organisational characteristics Two studies compared teacher training combined with school‐wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job‐related anxiety (MD ‐0.25 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.11, very low‐quality evidence) or depression (MD ‐0.26 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.05, very low‐quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale"

Paliperidone was associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia than placebo (n=1638, 5 RCTs, RR 1.88 CI 1.28 to 2.76, NNH 21 CI 11 to 90) and a consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) for both men (n=413, 4 RCTs, WMD 27.68 CI 23.66 to 31.69) and women (n=252, 4 RCTs, WMD 87.39 CI 74.27 to 100.51). People receiving paliperidone were more likely to experience extrapyramidal disorders (n=1680, 6 RCTs, RR 2.27 CI 1.31 to 3.95, NNH 28 CI 12 to 111) and weight gain (n=769, 4 RCTs, WMD 1.07 CI 0.65 to 1.49, I‐squared 78%) compared with those allocated to placebo. Three studies with 1692 participants compared paliperidone with 10 mg/day olanzapine. We found no differences between paliperidone and olanzapine for leaving in the short term (n=1332, 3 RCTs, RR 1.04 CI 0.89 to 1.21; ˜40% in both groups left by six weeks). Those receiving any dose of paliperidone were no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving olanzapine (n=1327, 3 RCTs, RR 1.07 CI 0.64 to 1.76). Data from all three studies found that paliperidone was associated with less weight change than olanzapine (n=660, 3 RCTs, WMD ‐0.88 CI ‐1.38 to ‐0.37). Results for various movement disorders all favoured olanzapine. One study lasting less than a week compared paliperidone with risperidone. When participants taking paliperidone were compared with participants taking 4 mg/day risperidone in this brief study, we found no significant difference in the recurrence of psychotic symptoms or in the incidence of adverse events. One study compared paliperidone, with a mean dose of 9.8 mg daily, versus quetiapine, with a mean dose of 599.1 mg daily, over six weeks. Patients receiving paliperidone were less likely to leave the study early (n=314, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.44 to 0.93, NNT 9 CI 6 to 43). No significant difference was observed in the recurrence of psychotic symptoms (n=317, 1 RCT, RR 0.65 CI 0.29 to 1.45, NNT 52 CI Not Significant). Participants receiving paliperidone were more likely to experience hypertonia (n=317, 1 RCT, RR 3.19 CI 1.31 to 7.77, NNH 13 CI 4 to 86) and tremor (n=317, 1 RCT, RR 2.60 CI 1.39 to 4.88, NNH 9 CI 4 to 34). There are no clear data regarding oral paliperidone relating to social functioning, services use, quality of life, patient satisfaction or cost. Authors conclusions In short‐term studies, oral paliperidone is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its parent compound, risperidone, with movement disorders, weight gain and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When used at doses of 6 mg per day or higher, oral paliperidone appears comparable in efficacy to olanzapine 10 mg/day. A single study of six days duration found neither an advantage nor disadvantage of paliperidone compared to risperidone. When dosed flexibly with other psychotropics available, it appears to be comparable in efficacy to flexible doses of quetiapine with other psychotropics available. Plain language summary Oral paliperidone for schizophrenia Paliperidone, 9‐hydroxy‐risperidone, is an active metabolite of risperidone that is now commercially available in an oral formulation. We evaluated the efficacy, adverse effects, and safety of oral paliperidone in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like illnesses. In short‐term studies, oral paliperidone is a more effective antipsychotic than placebo. The adverse effects of paliperidone are similar to those of risperidone. No data comparing the efficacy of paliperidone to risperidone over a meaningful period of time was available for this review; in a six‐day trial comparing paliperidone to risperidone we identified no difference in recurrence of psychotic symptoms or adverse effects.

Poor oral hygiene has been linked to coronary heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory disease and impacts on quality of life, affecting everyday functioning such as eating, comfort, appearance, social acceptance, and self esteem. Oral health, however, is often not seen as a priority in people suffering with serious mental illness.

In developing countries, however, limited resources mean that it is not always possible to provide discrete psychiatric units, either in general hospitals or in the community. An alternative model of admission, used in the Caribbean, is to treat the person with acute psychosis in a general hospital ward. Objectives To compare the outcomes for people with acute psychosis who have been admitted to open medical wards with those admitted to conventional psychiatric units. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups study‐based register (April 2007). This register is compiled from searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, Sociofile, and many conference proceedings. Selection criteria We would have included all relevant randomised or quasi‐randomised trials, allocating anyone thought to be suffering from an acute psychotic episode to either acute management on general medical wards, or acute management in a specialist psychiatric unit. The primary outcomes of interest were length of stay in hospital and relapse. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we would have calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based using a fixed effects model. Main results We didnt identify any relevant randomised trials. Authors conclusions The Caribbean practice of treating people with severe mental illness on general medical wards has been influenced by socio‐economic factors rather than evidence from randomised trials. This practice affords an opportunity for a well designed, well conducted and reported randomised trial, now impossible in many other settings. Plain language summary Open general medical wards versus specialist psychiatric units for acute psychoses Psychosis is disturbance of a person’s thinking that causes them to have false perceptions of the senses (hallucinations) and see the world in a different way from the majority (delusions). Psychosis can cause the sufferer to become very distressed. The majority of people who need hospital treatment for psychosis receive it in specialist psychiatric wards. However in some parts of the developing world, especially the Caribbean, a system has grown up where people with psychosis are admitted and treated on general medical wards along with those who have non‐psychiatric conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. They are treated with antipsychotics and are expected to help nurse others as they get better. This review attempted to compare trials randomising treatment in a general medical ward with treatment in a psychiatric ward, however there are no trials which meet the inclusion criteria. Since there is a published article which suggests that people in a general ward recover faster and are more able to return to employment or education afterwards, it would be helpful to do a randomised controlled trial comparing these two treatments to see if this is the case.

This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega‐3 PUFAs play in the development and integrity of the brains neurons, their protective antioxidative effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical mechanisms directly related to Alzheimer‐specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega‐3 PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega‐3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option for dementia. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with dementia. Search methods We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We contacted manufacturers of omega‐3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega‐3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were administered to people with Alzheimers disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Data collection and analysis The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, dementia severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted meta‐analyses for available outcome measures at six months. Main results We included three comparable randomised, placebo‐controlled trials investigating omega‐3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants with mild to moderate AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of dementia. All trials were of high methodological quality. The overall quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was high. There was no evidence of a benefit from omega‐3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale ‐ Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini‐Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence).

Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random effects model. Main results The review currently includes 50 studies and 9476 participants which provided data for six comparisons (olanzapine compared to amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone). The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) more than aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=794, WMD ‐4.96 CI ‐8.06 to ‐1.85), quetiapine (10 RCTs, n=1449, WMD ‐3.66 CI ‐5.39 to ‐1.93), risperidone (15 RCTs, n=2390, WMD ‐1.94 CI ‐3.31 to ‐0.58) and ziprasidone (4 RCTs, n=1291, WMD ‐8.32 CI ‐10.99 to ‐5.64), but not more than amisulpride or clozapine. This somewhat better efficacy was confirmed by fewer participants in the olanzapine groups leaving the studies early due to inefficacy of treatment compared to quetiapine (8 RCTs, n=1563, RR 0.56 CI 0.44 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 6 to 50), risperidone (14 RCTs, n=2744, RR 0.78 CI 0.62 to 0.98, NNT 50 CI 17 to 100) and ziprasidone (5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 0.64 CI 0.51 to 0.79, NNT 17, CI 11 to 33). Fewer participants in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=876, RR 0.56 CI 0.41 to 0.77, NNT 11 CI 7 to 25) and ziprasidone (2 RCTs, n=766, RR 0.65 CI 0.45 to 0.93, NNT 17 CI 9 to 100) treatment groups, but not in the clozapine group (1 RCT, n=980, RR 1.28 CI 1.02 to 1.61, NNH not estimable), had to be re‐hospitalised in the trials. Except for clozapine, all comparators induced less weight gain than olanzapine (olanzapine compared to amisulpride"

Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat acute manic episodes. It is important to clarify whether olanzapine could have a role in long‐term prevention of manic and depressive relapses. Objectives To assess the effects of olanzapine, as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment, in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar affective disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (September 2006), MEDLINE (1966‐December 2007), EMBASE (1980‐2006), CINAHL (1982‐2006), PsycINFO (1872‐2006) and reference lists. We also contacted experts, trialists and pharmaceutical companies in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing olanzapine with placebo or other active treatment in long‐term treatment of bipolar disorder. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results Five trials (1165 participants) were included in the review. There was no statistically significant difference between olanzapine and placebo (either alone or in combination with lithium or valproate) in terms of number of participants who experienced relapse into mood episode (random effects RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, p = 0.09; 2 studies, n=460), however restricting the analysis to the trial that compared olanzapine monotherapy versus placebo, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of olanzapine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69, p<0.00001). No statistically significant difference was found between olanzapine and other mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate) in preventing symptomatic relapse for any mood episode, however, olanzapine was more effective than lithium in preventing symptomatic manic relapse (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89, p = 0.01; 1 study, n=361). Olanzapine either alone or as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilisers was associated with significantly greater weight gain than placebo. By contrast, olanzapine was associated with a lower rate of manic worsening, but with a higher rate of weight increase and depression than lithium. Authors\ conclusions Though based on a limited amount of information, there is evidence that olanzapine may prevent further mood episodes in patients who have responded to olanzapine during an index manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate. However, notwithstanding these positive results, the current evidence is stronger for lithium as first line maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

Schizophrenia can occur as an isolated episode, or as a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, and is associated with impairment in psychosocial and occupational functioning. Although antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for people with schizophrenia, in most countries mental health services usually provide a range of add‐on interventions, including occupational therapy. This is a complex intervention designed to support and enable continued participation in daily life through engagement in activities and occupations meaningful to the individual. Occupational therapists are professionals trained to deliver therapy where the emphasis is on improving occupational function and participation rather than treating symptoms, and uses a wide range of methods based on the needs of individuals. However, similar interventions may also be delivered by staff not trained as occupational therapists. Objectives To examine the effects of occupational therapy delivered by occupational therapists compared to occupational therapy delivered by any other person for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers) on 4 November 2016 and 26 July 2018. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials evaluating the functional or clinical outcomes of occupational therapy, or both, for people with schizophrenia delivered by occupational therapists compared with occupational therapy for people with schizophrenia delivered by anyone other than occupational therapists. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. Main results The search yielded 1633 records. Of these, we retrieved 17 full‐text reports (14 studies) for further scrutiny, which we subsequently excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Authors conclusions Currently there are no randomised controlled trials comparing delivery of occupational therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia by occupational therapists with delivery of similar interventions by anyone other than occupational therapists. Research studies employing methodologically robust trial designs are needed to establish whether or not there are better outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia with occupational therapy that is delivered by trained occupational therapists. Plain language summary Occupational therapy for schizophrenia provided by occupational therapists compared to others Review question Is there good‐quality evidence that occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists rather than anyone else? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition with a range of symptoms including hearing voices, unusual beliefs, paranoia, disorganised thinking or speech, and loss of motivation. In addition to people diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving medical treatments, services that support such individuals often provide further therapies such as occupational therapy. Occupational therapy aims to help improve the functioning and ability to take part in meaningful activities of people with schizophrenia, rather than focusing on reducing symptoms. Occupational therapy may be provided by specialist professionals trained as occupational therapists. However, similar therapy may be provided by other people who are not trained occupational therapists (e.g. doctors, nurses, other allied health professionals, or support staff). We wanted to find out whether there were any differences between the effectiveness of occupational therapy provided by occupational therapists and similar therapy provided by people not trained as occupational therapists. Searching for evidence On 26 July 2018 we ran an electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups specialised register of trials for clinical trials that allocated people with schizophrenia randomly to receive occupational therapy provided by an occupational therapist or receive occupational therapy provided by anyone else. Evidence found We identified 1633 potentially relevant records through our database searching, from which we obtained 17 full‐text articles for closer inspection. We were unable to include any of these studies in the review and excluded a total of 14 studies. Conclusions At present there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to permit a judgement as to whether occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more effective if it is provided by trained occupational therapists compared to anyone else. Research is needed to answer this question and to help service providers plan future services that include occupational therapy for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia."""

It is unknown whether non‐pharmacological interventions for depression are effective for people with TBI. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions for depression in adults and children with TBI at reducing the diagnosis and severity of symptoms of depression. Search methods We ran the most recent search on 11 February 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases and clinical trials registers. Relevant conference proceedings and journals were handsearched, as were the reference lists of identified studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non‐pharmacological interventions for depression in adults and children who had a TBI. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials from the search results, then assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. The authors contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We rated the overall quality of the evidence of the primary outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results Six studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 334 adult participants. We identified no studies that included children as participants. All studies were affected by high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding of participants and personnel; five studies were affected by high risk of bias for lack of blinding of outcome assessors. There was high or unclear risk of biases affecting some studies across all the Cochrane risk of bias measures. Three studies compared a psychological intervention (either cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy) with a control intervention. Data regarding depression symptom outcome measures were combined in a meta‐analysis, but did not find an effect in favour of treatment (SMD ‐0.14; 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.19; Z = 0.83; P = 0.41). The other comparisons comprised of single studies of depression symptoms and compared; cognitive behaviour therapy versus supportive psychotherapy (SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI ‐0.65 to 0.48; Z = 0.30; P = 0.77); repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation plus tricyclic antidepressant (rTMS + TCA) versus tricyclic antidepressant alone (SMD ‐0.84; 95% CI ‐1.36 to ‐0.32; Z = 3;19, P = 0.001); and a supervised exercise program versus exercise as usual (SMD ‐0.43; 95% CI ‐0.88 to 0.03; Z = 1.84; P = 0.07). There was very‐low quality evidence, small effect sizes and wide variability of results, suggesting that no comparisons showed a reliable effect for any intervention. Only one study mentioned minor, transient adverse events from repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Authors conclusions The review did not find compelling evidence in favour of any intervention. Future studies should focus on participants with a diagnosed TBI and include only participants who have a diagnosis of depression, or who record scores above a clinical cutoff on a depression measure. There is a need for additional RCTs that include a comparison between an intervention and a control that replicates the effect of the attention given to participants during an active treatment. Plain language summary Non‐drug treatments for depression in children and adults who have had a traumatic brain injury Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of non‐drug treatments for depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI), to determine whether these treatments are better than no intervention, or better than drug‐based treatments, at reducing the symptoms or diagnosis of depression. We searched for evidence about the relative effectiveness of different types of treatments, and whether the treatments had any harmful or negative effects. Background Depression is more common in people who have had a TBI. Depression increases the risk of suicide and is a factor that limits recovery from TBI. There are many non‐drug treatments for depression. This review aimed to determine the effects of non‐drug interventions for people with TBI. Search date The review authors searched for randomised studies that had been published up to February 2015. Study characteristics We found six studies, with a total of 334 adult participants. We found no studies that included people younger than 18 years of age. Four studies investigated psychological interventions. One study investigated an exercise intervention, and another investigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Key results Three studies compared a psychological therapy (cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy) with a no‐treatment control intervention. When the data for these studies were combined, there was no reliable effect in support of psychological therapy. One study compared cognitive behavioural therapy with another psychological intervention (supportive psychotherapy), and did not find an effect in favour of either intervention. One study compared a supervised exercise programme with exercise as usual, but did not find a effect in favour of either intervention. One study compared rTMS plus an antidepressant medication with the antidepressant medication alone. Because the quality of the evidence was very low, it was not possible to draw the conclusion that the addition of rTMS improved outcomes. Only one study, of rTMS, reported any harmful effects and these were relatively minor and resolved quickly. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was rated very low. All studies were at high risk of bias in some ways, and therefore it was not possible to draw conclusions in support of any intervention. There was a high degree of variability in the main results, which meant we could have little confidence in the findings. Some studies had major methodological flaws. Conclusions It is not possible to recommend any particular treatment based on the current evidence. The review authors have made some recommendations to improve the quality of the evidence in future studies."""

There is a need, therefore, to identify effective, non‐pharmacological interventions for maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment among people with a previous cancer diagnosis. Objectives To evaluate the cognitive effects, non‐cognitive effects, duration and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions among cancer patients targeted at maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment as a result of cancer or receipt of systemic cancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy or hormonal therapies in isolation or combination with other treatments). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PUBMED, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO databases. We also searched registries of ongoing trials and grey literature including theses, dissertations and conference proceedings. Searches were conducted for articles published from 1980 to 29 September 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non‐pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive functioning among survivors of adult‐onset cancers who have completed systemic cancer therapy (in isolation or combination with other treatments) were eligible. Studies among individuals continuing to receive hormonal therapy were included. We excluded interventions targeted at cancer survivors with central nervous system (CNS) tumours or metastases, non‐melanoma skin cancer or those who had received cranial radiation or, were from nursing or care home settings. Language restrictions were not applied. Data collection and analysis Author pairs independently screened, selected, extracted data and rated the risk of bias of studies. We were unable to conduct planned meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity in the type of interventions and outcomes, with the exception of compensatory strategy training interventions for which we pooled data for mental and physical well‐being outcomes. We report a narrative synthesis of intervention effectiveness for other outcomes. Main results Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review. Two trials of computer‐assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed‐ and immediate‐ memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well‐being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed‐, immediate‐ and verbal‐memory, self‐reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta‐analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well‐being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.59 to 0.83; I 2 = 67%) or two months post‐intervention (SMD ‐ 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.89 to 0.47; I 2  = 63%) or on mental well‐being two months post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐1.10 to 0.34; I 2  = 67%). Lower mental well‐being immediately post‐intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait‐list controls (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.16; I 2  = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be  low quality  and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear. Authors conclusions Overall, the, albeit l ow‐quality evidence  may be interpreted to suggest that non‐pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment. Larger, multi‐site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach. There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment among cancer patient groups other than women with breast cancer. Plain language summary Interventions for cognitive impairment due to non‐localised cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy The issue An increasing number of people are surviving and living longer with cancer due to earlier diagnosis, better treatments and an aging population. In turn, there is an increasing number of people with long‐term or long‐lasting effects of cancer and its treatment. For example, up to seven in 10 cancer survivors experience changes in ability regarding memory, learning new things, concentrating, planning and making decisions about their everyday life, as a result of cancer treatment. This is known as cognitive impairment and has a significant impact on the daily activities of cancer survivors. These changes may be caused by non‐localised, systemic cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and is often called chemo‐fog or chemobrain. The aim of the review We reviewed studies that have tested interventions intended to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive function among people who have been treated with systemic cancer treatments. What are the main findings? We identified five eligible studies that described six interventions. These included two studies of computerised cognitive skills practice, two cognitive coping skills training programmes, one meditation intervention and one exercise intervention. All five studies included a total of 235 women who had been treated for breast cancer. The findings suggest that cognitive skills practice and cognitive coping skills training may be useful in improving patient reports and formal assessments of cognition, as well as quality of life. There was insufficient evidence to know if meditation and exercise interventions had any effect on cognition. What is the quality of the evidence? The quality of the evidence was low. There were problems with study designs and, so, we need to be cautious about our conclusions. What are the conclusions? There is not enough good quality evidence to know if any interventions improve cognitive impairment or maintain cognitive functioning among people who have received systemic treatment for cancer. There are several ongoing trials in the field, which may provide the necessary evidence in the future."""

To examine if there was a differential effect for the various compounds. 4. To examine whether the use of non‐antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs are most effective in those with more recent onset TD (less than five years). Search methods We retrieved 712 references from searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017). We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We selected studies if they were randomised controlled trials focusing on people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses and antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. We compared the use of catecholaminergic interventions versus placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left the studies early had no improvement. Main results There are 10 included trials (N = 261) published between 1973 and 2010; eight are new from the 2015 and 2017 update searches. Forty‐eight studies are excluded. Participants were mostly chronically mentally ill inpatients in their 50s, and studies were primarily of short (2 to 6 weeks) duration. The overall risk of bias in these studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and generation of the sequence. Studies were also not clearly blinded and we are unsure if data are incomplete or selectively reported, or if other biases were operating. One small, three‐arm trial found that both alpha‐methyldopa (N = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80;  low‐quality evidence ) and reserpine (N = 20; RR 0.52 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96;  low‐quality evidence ) may lead to a clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared with placebo after 2 weeks treatment, but found no evidence of a difference between alpha‐methyldopa and reserpine (N = 20; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.86;  very low quality evidence ). Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks treatment and found no evidence of a difference on clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms (N = 13; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.95;  very low quality evidence ). No study reported on adverse events. For remaining outcomes there was no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions"""

Skewed data have been presented in the Data and analyses as other data, with acknowledged means and standard deviations. We assessed risk of bias for the included study and used GRADE to create a Summary of findings table. Main results We included only one study that compared nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care with standard care alone (total 52 participants); this study was classified by its authors as a pilot study. The duration of the included study was 18 months in total. The single study examined the short‐term (up to six months) and medium‐term (between six and 12 months) effects of nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care versus standard care. Nidotherapy‐enhanced standard care was favoured over standard care for social functioning in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐4.66 to 0.46) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD ‐1.70, 95% CI ‐4.60 to 1.20,  Very low quality ); however, these results did not reach statistical significance. Results concerning engagement with non‐inpatient services favoured the intervention group in both the short term (n = 50, 1 RCT, MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.87) and medium term (n = 37, 1 RCT, MD 1.70, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 3.49), with statistical significance evident in the short term, but not in the medium term. Results of people leaving the study early favoured the intervention in the short term (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.98), with slight favour of the control group at medium term (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.54); again, these results did not reach statistical significance. Results for the adverse effects/events of death (measured by 12 months) favoured the intervention (n = 52, 1 RCT, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.74,  Very low quality ) but with no statistical significance. Skewed results were available for mental state, service use, and economic outcomes, and present a mixed picture of the benefits of nidotherapy. Authors conclusions Further research is needed into the possible benefits or harms of this newly‐formulated therapy. Until such research is available, patients, clinicians, managers and policymakers should consider it an experimental approach. Plain language summary Nidotherapy for schizophrenia Nidotherapy (from the Latin ‘ nidus ’ or ‘nest’) aims at identifying the need for and making changes to a person’s environment and surroundings. It works alongside other treatments to make improvements to a person’s well being, housing, money management, personal relationships, work and other factors. The aim of nidotherapy is not to change the person (whereas other psychological therapies often aim to make changes in an individual’s behaviour, emotions and thinking) but to create a better ‘fit’ between the environment and the individual. As a consequence the individual may improve, but this is not a direct result of treatment but because a more harmonious relationship has been created with the environment. Benefits of nidotherapy may include improvements in people’s relationships, self‐esteem, taking their medication, mental health and generally creating a better life situation. If environmental factors or someone’s surroundings are at all responsible for causing illness and relapse, then nidotherapists and people with schizophrenia can identify these factors together to try and reduce the number and severity of relapses. This review includes one small pilot study with 52 participants. The study compared nidotherapy with standard care versus standard care alone and lasted 18 months. Findings suggest some limited evidence that those who received nidotherapy might experience a slight improvement in social functioning or personal relationships, mental state and may spend less time as inpatients in hospital over the course of 12 months, but there is no information concerning the appropriateness of this for the individual. However, these limited findings need to be treated with considerable caution. The degree of any possible improvements that come from taking part in nidotherapy remain unclear due to the single study’s small sample size, incomplete evidence and risk of bias. No evidence is available on the effect of nidotherapy on general functioning, quality of life, taking medication, satisfaction with treatment, employment status or adverse effects. Further research is required to fill this gap in knowledge about the effectiveness, benefits and possible hazards of nidotherapy. Until such a time, people with mental health problems, health professionals, managers and policymakers should consider this new therapy an experimental one.

Many treatment guidelines recommend the use of new generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs for people with a first episode of schizophrenia. Objectives To examine the effects of the new generation antipsychotics for people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods The reviewers searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register (March 2002) and the included and excluded studies tables of relevant Cochrane reviews, references of all relevant studies, contacted industry and authors of relevant studies to identify further trials. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing new generation antipsychotics (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sulpiride, ziprasidone, zotepine) with conventional antipsychotics for people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by three reviewers, papers ordered, re‐inspected and quality assessed. We independently extracted data but excluded them if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We include two short‐term studies (total n=266), one of which was a report of a sub‐group of a larger study. One compared risperidone with an average of 6 mg/day haloperidol and the other olanzapine with an average of 11 mg/day haloperidol. Compared with olanzapine, significantly more people receiving haloperidol left the study early (n=83, 1 RCT, RR 0.43 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 3 CI 2 to 8). This was not so for the risperidone versus haloperidol comparison (n=183, 1 RCT, RR=0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.1). In terms of global effects, studies reported no differences between risperidone and haloperidol (n=183, RR not much improved 1.0 CI 0.6 to 1.5), and olanzapine and the same control (n=83, RR needing at least one dose of benzodiazepine 0.8 CI 0.5 to 1.1). More people allocated to olanzapine had clinically significant improvement in mental state compared with those given haloperidol (n=83, RR no clinically significant improvement 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6). In the risperidone study, however, no such difference was apparent (n=183, RR no clinically significant improvement in mental state 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.2). Significantly more people given haloperidol (4‐16mg) experienced at least one adverse event when compared with risperidone (4‐16mg) (n=183, RR 0.9 CI 0.8 to 0.98, NNH 8 CI 4 to 50). Use of anticholinergic medication for extrapyramidal adverse events was less prevalent for people allocated either olanzapine (n=83, RR 0.3 CI 0.2 to 0.7, NNH 4 CI 2 to 14) or risperidone (n=183, RR 0.7 CI 0.5 to 0.9, NNH 4 CI 3 to 9) compared with those given haloperidol. There are no data at all on outcomes such as compliance, cost, social and cognitive functioning, relapse, rehospitalisation, or quality of life. There are no medium to long‐term data. Eight ongoing studies may provide more information. Authors conclusions The results of this review are inconclusive. Whether the use of new generation antipsychotics really makes the treatment less off putting and enhances long‐term compliance is unclear. Pragmatic, well‐designed and reported long‐term trials would be useful to answer this question. Plain language summary New generation antipsychotics for first episode schizophrenia A new generation of antipsychotics, drugs such as olanzapine and risperidone are recommended for people with a first episode of schizophrenia. Currently, the quality of information is too limited to come to any firm conclusions. A number of ongoing studies should provide more and better information in the near future."""

Within the area of serious mental disorders, the aim of the therapy is to help people improve their emotional and relational competencies, and address issues they may not be able to using words alone. Objectives To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, compared with placebo therapy, standard care or no treatment for people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Study‐Based Register (December 2010 and 15 January, 2015) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching of music therapy journals and manual searches of reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared music therapy with standard care, placebo therapy, or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. We excluded data where more than 30% of participants in any group were lost to follow‐up. We synthesised non‐skewed continuous endpoint data from valid scales using a standardised mean difference (SMD). We employed a fixed‐effect model for all analyses. If statistical heterogeneity was found, we examined treatment dosage (i.e. number of therapy sessions) and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity. Main results Ten new studies have been added to this update; 18 studies with a total 1215 participants are now included. These examined effects of music therapy over the short, medium, and long‐term, with treatment dosage varying from seven to 240 sessions. Overall, most information is from studies at low or unclear risk of bias A positive effect on global state was found for music therapy compared to standard care (medium term, 2 RCTs, n = 133, RR 0.38 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.59,  low‐quality evidence , number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 4). No binary data were available for other outcomes. Medium‐term continuous data identified good effects for music therapy on negative symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (3 RCTs, n = 177, SMD ‐ 0.55 95% CI ‐0.87 to ‐0.24,  low‐quality evidence ) .  General mental state endpoint scores on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale were better for music therapy (2 RCTs, n = 159, SMD ‐0.97 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.63,  low‐quality evidence ), as were average endpoint scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (1 RCT, n = 70, SMD ‐1.25 95% CI ‐1.77 to ‐0.73,  moderate‐quality evidence ).

Systematic reviews have suggested that individual psychological debriefing is not an effective intervention at preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the past 20 years, other forms of intervention have been developed with the aim of preventing PTSD. Objectives To examine the efficacy of psychological interventions aimed at preventing PTSD in individuals exposed to a traumatic event but not identified as experiencing any specific psychological difficulties, in comparison with control conditions (e.g. usual care, waiting list and no treatment) and other psychological interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and ProQuests Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database to 3 March 2018. An earlier search of CENTRAL and the Ovid databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to May 2016). We handsearched reference lists of relevant guidelines, systematic reviews and included study reports. Identified studies were shared with key experts in the field. We conducted an update search (15 March 2019) and placed any new trials in the awaiting classification section. These will be incorporated into the next version of this review, as appropriate. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials of any multiple session (two or more sessions) early psychological intervention or treatment designed to prevent symptoms of PTSD. We excluded single session individual/group psychological interventions. Comparator interventions included waiting list/usual care and active control condition. We included studies of adults who experienced a traumatic event which met the criterion A1 according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐IV) for PTSD. Data collection and analysis We entered data into Review Manager 5 software. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data with a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, except where there was heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias and discussed any conflicts with a third review author. Main results This is an update of a previous review. We included 27 studies with 3963 participants. The meta‐analysis included 21 studies of 2721 participants. Seventeen studies compared multiple session early psychological intervention versus treatment as usual and four studies compared a multiple session early psychological intervention with active control condition. Low‐certainty evidence indicated that multiple session early psychological interventions may be more effective than usual care in reducing PTSD diagnosis at three to six months follow‐up (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93; I 2  = 34%; studies = 5; participants = 758). However, there was no statistically significant difference post‐treatment (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; I 2  = 0%; studies = 5; participants = 556; very low‐certainty evidence) or at seven to 12 months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.49; studies = 1; participants = 132; very low‐certainty evidence). Meta‐analysis indicated that there was no statistical difference in dropouts compared with usual care (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.95; I 2  = 34%; studies = 11; participants = 1154; low‐certainty evidence) .At the primary endpoint of three to six months, low‐certainty evidence indicated no statistical difference between groups in reducing severity of PTSD (SMD –0.10, 95% CI –0.22 to 0.02; I 2  = 34%; studies = 15; participants = 1921), depression (SMD –0.04, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.10; I 2  = 6%; studies = 7; participants = 1009) or anxiety symptoms (SMD –0.05, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.10; I 2  = 2%; studies = 6; participants = 945). No studies comparing an intervention and active control reported outcomes for PTSD diagnosis. Low‐certainty evidence showed that interventions may be associated with a higher dropout rate than active control condition (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.34; studies = 2; participants = 425). At three to six months, low‐certainty evidence indicated no statistical difference between interventions in terms of severity of PTSD symptoms (SMD –0.02, 95% CI –0.31 to 0.26; I 2  = 43%; studies = 4; participants = 465), depression (SMD 0.04, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.23; I 2  = 0%; studies = 2; participants = 409), anxiety (SMD 0.00, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.19; I 2  = 0%; studies = 2; participants = 414) or quality of life (MD –0.03, 95% CI –0.06 to 0.00; studies = 1; participants = 239). None of the included studies reported on adverse events or use of health‐related resources. Authors conclusions While the review found some beneficial effects of multiple session early psychological interventions in the prevention of PTSD, the certainty of the evidence was low due to the high risk of bias in the included trials. The clear practice implication of this is that, at present, multiple session interventions aimed at everyone exposed to traumatic events cannot be recommended. There are a number of ongoing studies, demonstrating that this is a fast moving field of research. Future updates of this review will integrate the results of these new studies. Plain language summary Multiple session early psychological interventions for prevention of post‐traumatic stress disorder Why was this review important? Traumatic events can have a significant effect on the ability of individuals, families and communities to cope. In the past, single session interventions such as psychological debriefing were widely used with the aim of preventing continuing psychological difficulties. However, previous reviews have found that single session individual interventions have not been effective at preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A range of other forms of intervention have been developed to try to prevent people exposed to trauma from developing PTSD. Who will be interested in this review? • People exposed to traumatic events and their loved ones. • Professionals working in mental health services. • General practitioners. • Commissioners. What questions did this review try to answer? Are multiple session early psychological interventions (i.e. interventions over two or more sessions beginning within the first three months after the traumatic event) more effective than treatment as usual or another psychological intervention in"""

The therapy involves a behavioural structured program to encourage an outward perspective on life and increased social functioning. Objectives To evaluate the effects of Morita therapy for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register, the Chongqing VIP Database, and the Wanfang Database (July 2008) for all relevant references. The first author of each included study was also contacted. We updated this search (July 2012) and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials comparing Morita therapy with any other treatment. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies and extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random‐effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We found 12 small, studies of medium‐poor quality (total n=1123). The standard care versus Morita therapy comparison (total n=761 people) had very low attrition (<2%, 10 RCTs, RR 1.01 CI 0.4 to 2.8). Mental state did tend to improve with Morita therapy (n=76, 1 RCT, number of >25‐30% decline in BPRS, RR 0.36 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 5 CI 4 to 25). For negative symptoms data were inconsistent, with data from four short‐term trials favouring Morita therapy (n=323, WMD average endpoint SANS ‐12.94 CI ‐21.6 to ‐4.3), but heterogeneity was considerable (I 2  =97%). In medium‐term studies, negative symptoms were favoured by Morita therapy (n=44, 1 RCT, RR >25% decline SANS 0.25 CI 0.1 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 8). Morita therapy plus standard treatment did significantly improve the activities of daily living compared with standard treatment alone (n=104, 1 RCT, WMD ‐4.1 average endpoint ADL CI ‐7.7 to ‐0.6). Compared with a rehabilitation programme Morita therapy did not promote attrition (n=302, 2 RCTs, RR leaving early 1.00 CI 0.5 to 2.1). In two very similar studies Morita therapy showed better effect on mental state with lower BPRS score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint BPRS ‐6.95 CI ‐9.3 to ‐4.6, I 2  =0%), insight score (n=278, 2 RCTs, WMD average endpoint clinical judgement score ‐1.11 CI ‐1.3 to ‐0.9, I 2  = 0%) and social functioning (n=278, WMD average endpoint IPROS ‐18.14 CI ‐21.3 to ‐15.0, I 2  =0%). Authors conclusions Morita therapy for schizophrenia remains an experimental intervention. New trials are justified and specific plans for the design of future studies are outlined. Note"""

Furthermore, we extended our search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the Sagace, a web‐based search engine for biomedical databases in Japan. We applied no date or language restrictions. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials comparing Morita therapy with any other treatment in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated fixed‐effect standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% CI. Main results We found seven small Chinese studies (449 participants), six of which provided useable data for meta‐analysis. No study compared Morita therapy with an inactive control. Unclear randomisation methods, lack of blinding and low quality reporting of outcomes were common in the included studies. We graded the overall risk of bias as high and the quality of the evidence as very low. Two social phobia studies (75 outpatients) directly compared Morita therapy with pharmacological therapy. In this comparison, the pooled RR of global state was 1.85 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.69) and the NNTB was 3 (95% CI 2 to 5), indicating a significant difference between groups favouring Morita therapy in the short term (up to 12 weeks post‐treatment). Data regarding drop‐outs was insufficient and no description of adverse effects was provided. We graded the quality of the evidence for this comparison as very low, mainly due to high risk of bias in the studies and insufficient information in the results. Four studies (288 inpatients) investigated the effect of Morita therapy plus pharmacological therapy versus pharmacological therapy alone, three studies for the treatment of obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD) (228 participants) and one study for generalised anxiety disorder (60 participants). One of the OCD studies reported incomplete data of global state while the outcome of global state was missing in the other three studies. There was no significant difference between groups for drop‐outs for any reason in two OCD studies in the short term (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 6.67; I 2  = 44%). Information pertaining to drop‐outs for adverse effects was unclear. We rated the risk of bias of this comparison as high. We graded the quality of the evidence as very low. Authors conclusions The evidence base on Morita therapy for anxiety disorders was limited. All studies included in this review were conducted in China, and the results may not be applicable to Western countries. These included studies were small, provided insufficient information about drop‐outs and adverse effects, and contained considerable risk of bias. Therefore, we graded the evidence as very low quality and were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of Morita therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Well‐designed future studies that employ adequate allocation concealment, recruit large sample sizes, report drop‐outs and adverse effects, and report outcomes clearly and consistently are needed to establish the effectiveness of Morita therapy for anxiety disorders. Plain language summary Morita therapy for anxiety disorders in adults Background Anxiety disorders are some of the most prevalent mental disorders. Morita therapy, a systematic psychological therapy based on eastern philosophy, has been used to treat anxiety disorders for decades. It encourages people with anxiety disorders to accept anxiety as a natural feeling, while at the same time it engages them in constructive behaviours via four phases, which sequentially are bed rest in isolation, light work, heavy work and preparation for normal daily living. Acceptance is merely redirecting attention towards purposeful behaviour. People get better when they stop trying to eliminate anxiety and fulfil their desires with study and work in their actual personal and social lives. The efficacy of Morita therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders has been a much‐contested issue, often dividing opinion. To date, a systematic review (a review addressing a clearly worded question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant research) investigating the strength of evidence for Morita therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders has not been conducted. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared Morita therapy with treatments with medicines or other psychological therapies (e.g. talking therapies), no treatment or wait list control (where people are waiting to receive a treatment) of adults with anxiety disorders. The evidence was current to December 2014. Key results and quality of evidence We found seven small Chinese studies with 449 participants to include in the review. Six of the seven studies provided useable data for us to analyse; they assessed Morita therapy for generalised anxiety disorder (a long‐term illness that causes people to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues; one study), social phobia (a persistent fear about social situations and being around people; two studies) and obsessive‐compulsive disorder (where a person has obsessive thoughts and repetitive behaviours; three studies). However, these studies were small, imprecise and contained considerable risks of bias, so we were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of Morita therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The review highlighted the need for high‐quality studies to assess the efficacy of Morita therapy on anxiety disorders."""

Motivation and performance in social situations can be poor. Rewarding of tasks with money improves motivation to complete the tasks in everyday life. Careful use of targeted monetary rewards could also help people with troublesome symptoms of schizophrenia. Objectives To assess the effect of monetary incentive/rewards for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (June 2008). Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials comparing monetary rewards with standard care or no monetary rewards. Data collection and analysis Working independently, we selected studies for quality assessment and extracted relevant data. We analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated the Relative Risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data we calculated weighted mean differences (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals. Main results Five trials are excluded that investigate one type of monetary reward over another and may be included in a future update. We did include one study, carried out over 40 years ago, randomising a total of 25 very chronically ill people who had been in hospital an average of 20 years. The targeted task that was being encouraged was assembly of dolls. People allocated to the payment group produced less dolls than those not paid at all although this difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (MD ‐0.80 CI ‐1.44 to ‐0.16). Authors conclusions Monetary rewards have been the topic for sporadic evaluative research for decades and this review shows that randomised studies are possible. We suggest a design for a future informative trial. Plain language summary Monetary incentives for schizophrenia Money incentivises many. It has been used in experiments to promote various behaviours in people with schizophrenia. We found six trials, but only one compared monetary incentives to no incentives which was the focus of this particular review. This one, very small, study was undertaken in the early 1960s with people who had been in hospital for an average of two decades. It found no clear effect but little can be concluded from this outdated trial except that such studies are possible. We think more studies relevant to current circumstances are desirable."""

These can include positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech), cognitive symptoms (such as trouble focusing or paying attention or using information to make decisions), and negative symptoms (such as diminished emotional expression, avolition, alogia, and anhedonia). Antipsychotic drugs are often only partially effective, particularly in treating negative symptoms, indicating the need for additional treatment. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant drug that when taken in addition to an antipsychotic may offer some benefit for negative symptoms. Objectives To systematically assess the effects of mirtazapine as adjunct treatment for people with schizophrenia. Search methods The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) up to May 2018. Selection criteria All randomised‐controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data focusing on mirtazapine adjunct for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. For included studies we assessed risk of bias and created Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results We included nine RCTs with a total of 310 participants. All studies compared mirtazapine adjunct with placebo adjunct and were of short‐term duration. We considered five studies to have a high risk of bias for either incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, or other bias. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in mental state (negative and positive symptoms), leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in global state, clinically important change in quality of life, number of days in hospital and incidence of serious adverse events. One trial defined a reduction in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) overall score from baseline of at least 20% as no important response for negative symptoms. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the two treatments with similar numbers of participants from each group showing no important response to treatment (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14, 1 RCT, n = 20, very low‐quality evidence). Clinically important change in positive symptoms was not reported, however, clinically important change in overall mental state was reported by two trials and data for this outcome showed a favourable effect for mirtazapine (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92; I 2  = 75%, 2 RCTs, n = 77, very low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear difference for numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.66, 9 RCTs, n = 310, moderate‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a clear difference in global state Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) severity scores (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.48, 1 RCT, n = 39, very low‐quality evidence). A favourable effect for mirtazapine adjunct was found for the outcome clinically important change in akathisia (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.52, 2 RCTs, n = 86, low‐quality evidence; I 2  = 61%I). No data were reported for quality life or number of days in hospital. In addition to the main outcomes of interest, there was evidence relating to adverse events that the mirtazapine adjunct groups were associated with an increased risk of weight gain (RR 3.19, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.65, 4 RCTs, n = 127) and sedation/drowsiness (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.68, 7 RCTs, n = 223). Authors conclusions The available evidence is primarily of very low quality and indicates that mirtazapine adjunct is not clearly associated with an effect for negative symptoms, but there is some indication of a positive effect on overall mental state and akathisia. No effect was found for global state or leaving the study early and data were not available for quality of life or service use. Due to limitations of the quality and applicability of the evidence it is not possible to make any firm conclusions, the role of mirtazapine adjunct in routine clinical practice remains unclear. This underscores the need for new high‐quality evidence to further evaluate mirtazapine adjunct for schizophrenia. Plain language summary Mirtazapine as an add‐on treatment for schizophrenia Review question Is adding mirtazapine, an antidepressant medication, to standard care an effective and safe treatment for people with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness. Those affected typically exhibit abnormal social behaviour and an inability to judge what is real. There are three main types of symptoms. Positive symptoms are where patients hear voices or see things that are not there and can also have fixed false beliefs (delusions). Examples of negative symptoms are lack of motivation and withdrawal from social activities. Cognitive symptoms include a reduced ability to concentrate or difficulty in using information to make decisions. Schizophrena can be extremely debilitating, greatly affecting a persons social functioning and their ability to live independently. Antipsychotic medications are the main treatment for schizophrenia and are effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia but often do not fully treat the negative symptoms. Additional treatments (adjuncts) are often used alongside antipsychotics to help treat the negative symptoms. Antidepressant medications, such as mirtazapine, can be used as adjunct treatment. Mirtazapine may have the potential to improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but also has the potential to cause unpleasant side effects. Evidence summarising mirtazapines benefits and harms for people with schizophrenia is needed. Searching The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their specialised register for clinical trials that randomly allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either mirtazapine or another treatment in addition their standard care. The latest search was in May 2018 and we found a total of 35 references to potential trials. We carefully inspected the full‐text articles of these references for inclusion or exclusion from this review. Results Nine randomised controlled trials met the review requirements and provided useable data. The participants in the studies received either mirtazapine plus their standard care or their standard care plus a placebo. Results showed adding mirtazapine to standard treatment may slightly improve overall mental state but does not appear to specifically have a clinically important effect on negative symptoms. Adding mirtazapine to standard care may slightly improve the symptoms akathisia, a side effect of antipsychotics where a person is very restless and unable to keep still. No effect was found for global state or leaving the study early and data were not available for quality of life or hospital admission. In addition, some results showed mirtazapine was associated with a higher risk of weight gain and sedation. However, these results are based on evidence that is mainly very ‐ow quality. Conclusions Mirtazapine may have some positive effects for people with schizophrenia. However, these results are mainly based on very low‐quality evidence and we are uncertain about these effects. Firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of mirtazapine as an add on treatment for people with schizophrenia can not be made without more high‐quality research."""

Most current interventions have limited success in reducing stress among carers of people with dementia. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) draws on a range of practices and may be a promising approach to helping carers of people with dementia. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing the stress of family carers of people with dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 9 of 12, 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1950 to September 2017), Embase (Ovid SP 1974 to Sepetmber 2017), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science 1945 to September 2017), PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to September 2017), CINAHL (all dates to September 2017), LILACS (all dates to September 2017), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 6 September 2017, with no language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MBSR for family carers of people with dementia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened references for inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of trials with the Cochrane Risk of bias tool, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information, then conducted meta‐analyses, or reported results narratively in the case of insufficient data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included five RCTs involving 201 carers assessing the effectiveness of MBSR. Controls used in included studies varied in structure and content. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction programmes were compared with either active controls (those matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. education, social support, or progressive muscle relaxation), or inactive controls (those not matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. self help education or respite care). One trial used both active and inactive comparisons with MBSR. All studies were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about selective reporting, incomplete outcome data, or allocation concealment. 1. Compared with active controls, MBSR may reduce depressive symptoms of carers at the end of the intervention (3 trials, 135 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.98 to ‐0.28; P<0.001; low‐quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low‐quality evidence). Mindfulness‐based stress reduction compared with active control may decrease carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 78 participants; mean difference (MD) ‐7.50, 95% CI ‐13.11 to ‐1.89; P<0.001; low‐quality evidence) and may slightly increase carer burden (3 trials, 135 participants; SMD 0.24, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.58; P=0.18; low‐quality evidence), although both results were imprecise, and we could not exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be sure of any effect on carers coping style, nor could we determine whether carers were more or less likely to drop out of treatment. 2. Compared with inactive controls, MBSR showed no clear evidence of any effect on depressive symptoms (2 trials, 50 participants; MD ‐1.97, 95% CI ‐6.89 to 2.95; P=0.43; low‐quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low‐quality evidence). In this comparison, MBSR may also reduce carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 33 participants; MD ‐7.27, 95% CI ‐14.92 to 0.38; P=0.06; low‐quality evidence), although we were unable to exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be certain of any effects of MBSR on carer burden, the use of positive coping strategies, or dropout rates. We found no studies that looked at quality of life of carers or care‐recipients, or institutionalisation. Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting a single adverse event related to yoga practices at home Authors conclusions After accounting for non‐specific effects of the intervention (i.e. comparing it with an active control), low‐quality evidence suggests that MBSR may reduce carers depressive symptoms and anxiety, at least in the short term. There are significant limitations to the evidence base on MBSR in this population. Our GRADE assessment of the evidence was low to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily because of high risk of detection or performance bias, and imprecision. In conclusion, MBSR has the potential to meet some important needs of the carer, but more high‐quality studies in this field are needed to confirm its efficacy. Plain language summary Mindfulness‐based stress reduction for family carers of people with dementia Review question How effective is mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) in reducing stress‐related problems of family carers of people with dementia? Background Dementia has become a public health burden worldwide. Caring for people with dementia is highly stressful, thus carers are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, than general population. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction is a potentially promising intervention to target these issues. More information is needed about whether MBSR can help family carers of people with dementia. Study characteristics We searched for evidence up to September 2017 and found five randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing MBSR to a variety of other interventions. We reported the effects of MBSR programmes compared with active controls (interventions in which participants received a similar amount of attention to those in the MBSR group, such as social support or progressive muscle relaxation) or inactive controls (interventions in which participants received less attention than those in the MBSR group, such as self help education). Key results We were able to analyse study data from five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 201 carers. Findings from three studies (135 carers) showed that carers receiving MBSR may have a lower level of depressive symptoms at the end of treatment than those receiving an active control treatment. However, we found no clear evidence of any effect on depression when MBSR was compared with an inactive control treatment. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction may also lead to a reduction in carers anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment. Mindfulness‐based stress reduction may slightly increase carers feelings of burden. However, the results on anxiety and burden were very uncertain. We were unable to draw conclusions about carers coping strategies and the risk of dropping out of treatment due to the very low quality of the evidence. None of the studies measured quality of life of carers or people with dementia, or the rate of admission of people with dementia to care homes or hospitals. Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting one minor adverse event (neck strain in one participant practising yoga at home) Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, mainly because the studies were small and the way they were designed or conducted put them at risk of giving biased results. Consequently, we have limited confidence in the results. Conclusion To summarise, the review provides preliminary evidence on the effect of MBSR in treating some stress‐related problems of family carers of people with dementia. More good‐quality studies are needed before we can confirm whether or not MBSR is beneficial for family carers of people with dementia."""

Milnacipran, a dual serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer antidepressive agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug‐approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand‐searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active antidepressive agents (including non‐conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials. Main results A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n=2277) were included in the meta‐analysis.Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95% confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressive agents. However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs. Authors conclusions Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost‐effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression. Plain language summary Milnacipran versus other antidepressive agents for depression Major depression, also known as major depressive disorder or unipolar depression, is a common mental disorder characterised by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a persons ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy pleasurable activities. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a persons lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a persons life. Antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first‐line treatment for major depression in primary and secondary care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is one of the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care in some countries. This systematic review investigated the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran compared to that of other antidepressive agents in the acute phase treatment of major depression. A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (2277 participants) were included in this review. When we brought together the results of approximately 2000 patients, we were unable to say whether milnacipran is better, worse or the same when compared to other antidepressive agents used in practice in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. However, there is some evidence that fewer people taking milnacipran stop taking the drug (drop out) due to side effects and fewer people taking milnacipran experience side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth or constipation than do people who take tricyclic antidepressants."""

Memantine acts as an antagonist of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) type receptors, which is thought to reduce abnormal activation of glutamate neurotransmission. It binds with a low affinity to the NMDA receptor and so should not prevent learning and the formation of memory. Memantine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time, and is the subject of this review. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of memantine for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of memantine, as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with memantine was administered compared with a placebo group. Data collection and analysis No study was identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review. Main results No study was identified which met inclusion criteria for this review, however there is an on‐going randomised controlled study being conducted in the UK and data are expected in 2009. Authors conclusions As there are no included trials, recommendations cannot be made about memantine for AD in DS. Well‐designed, adequately powered studies are required. Plain language summary Memantine for dementia in people with Down syndrome Memantine is thought to improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD over time.The effects of memantine on AD are reported to be beneficial for people with moderate to severe AD in the general population, However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. Results from the one randomised controlled trial for the treatment of dementia in DS are not yet available (expected 2009)."""

It results from the bodys internal rhythms being out of step with the day‐night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re‐align them with the outside world. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet lag after air travel across several time zones. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine and Sleep by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in Side Effects of Drugs (SED) and SED Annuals, Reactions Weekly, MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food & Drug Administration. An updating search was carried out on 12/2/2008 but no new studies were identified. Selection criteria Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet lag or related components, such as subjective well being, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms. Data collection and analysis Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment. \u2028 Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, Reactions Weekly, and in the WHO UMC database. Main results Eight of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet‐lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow‐release melatonin suggests that a short‐lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) is 2, based on the only two trials that gave the necessary data. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important"""

The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second‐generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non‐randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second‐generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model, but included only one study. Main results We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH‐SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin. Authors conclusions Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. Plain language summary Melatonin and agomelatine for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, SAD becomes depression that seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who might be interested in this review? General practitioners, psychiatrists, pharmacists, other health professionals working in adult mental health services, and researchers could be interested in the results of this review. Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has friends or relatives who have experienced winter depression might also be interested. What questions does this review aim to answer? Because of the seasonal pattern and high recurrence of SAD, melatonin or agomelatine could be used to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this report is to examine whether benefits outweigh harms of melatonin or agomelatine when used to prevent onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD who were free of symptoms when the preventive intervention started. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and potential harms of interventions to prevent SAD. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to June 2018 for studies on melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study comparing agomelatine with placebo for one year. All 225 participants had a history of winter depression but were not depressed when the prevention study started. What does evidence from the review reveal? The included study showed neither a clear effect in favour nor against agomelatine as a preventive treatment. In addition, the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and safety of agomelatine for the prevention of winter depression. No evidence on melatonin for prevention of SAD was identified. Doctors need to discuss with persons with a history of SAD that currently evidence on agomelatine or melatonin for preventive treatment options for SAD is inconclusive, therefore treatment selection should be strongly based on peoples preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options. What should happen next? Review authors recommend that future studies should evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine or melatonin in preventing SAD and should directly compare these interventions against other treatment options, such as light therapy, antidepressants, or psychological therapies to determine the best treatment option for prevention of SAD."""

Symptoms may concern penile erection, lubrication, orgasm, libido, retrograde ejaculation, sexual arousal, or overall sexual satisfaction. These are major aspects of tolerability and can highly affect patients’ compliance. Objectives To determine the effects of different strategies (e.g. dose reduction, drug holidays, adjunctive medication, switching to another drug) for treatment of sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotic therapy. Search methods An updated search was performed in the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (3 May 2012) and the references of all identified studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials involving people with schizophrenia and sexual dysfunction. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated random effects risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), for crossover trials we calculated Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% CI. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) on the basis of a random‐effects model. We analysed cross‐over trials under consideration of correlation of paired measures. Main results Currently this review includes four pioneering studies (total n = 138 , duration two weeks to four months), two of which are cross‐over trials. One trial reported significantly more erections sufficient for penetration when receiving sildenafil compared with when receiving placebo (n = 32, MD 3.20 95% CI 1.83 to 4.57), a greater mean duration of erections (n = 32, MD 1.18 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84) and frequency of satisfactory intercourse (n = 32, MD 2.84 95% CI 1.61 to 4.07). The second trial found no evidence for selegiline as symptomatic treatment for antipsychotic‐induced sexual dysfunction compared with placebo (n = 10, MD change on Aizenbergs sexual functioning scale ‐0.40 95% CI ‐3.95 to 3.15). No evidence was found for switching to quetiapine from risperidone to improve sexual functioning (n = 36, MD ‐2.02 95% CI ‐5.79 to 1.75). One trial reported significant improvement in sexual functioning when participants switched from risperidone or an typical antipsychotic to olanzapine (n = 54, MD ‐0.80 95% CI ‐1.55 to ‐0.05). Authors conclusions We are not confident that cross‐over studies are appropriate for this participant group as they are best for conditions that are stable and for interventions with no physiological and psychological carry‐over. Sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of antipsychotic‐induced sexual dysfunction in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small short trial. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was a small, open label trial. Further well designed randomised control trials that are blinded and well conducted and reported, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, symptomatic therapy and switching antipsychotic on sexual function in people with antipsychotic‐induced sexual dysfunction are urgently needed. Plain language summary Management of sexual problems due to antipsychotic drug therapy Drugs commonly used to treat schizophrenia often cause sexual problems.This may affect erection, lubrication, orgasm, desire or libido, ejaculation, sexual arousal or overall sexual satisfaction. This may have serious negative consequences such as putting people off taking their medication or stopping taking drugs at an early stage. Sexual problems may limit a person’s quality of life, worsen self‐esteem and cause relationship problems.Strategies to manage these sexual problems are taking additional drugs (Viagra  TM ), short drug holidays when people temporarily stop antipsychotic medication, reduction of dose and switching to another antipsychotic drug. This review includes four pioneering studies with a total of 138 participants lasting between two weeks to four months, meaning all were small and quite short. Two of the studies compared the effects of drugs to treat sexual problems and two compared the effect of switching to a different antipsychotic drug (while remaining on a current antipsychotic). There is some evidence that sildenafil ((Viagra TM , Revatio TM )) may be a good treatment for men who have problems getting and maintaining an erection. It also seems to increase frequency and satisfaction of sexual intercourse. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women. However, before confident claims can be made, much more research on strategies to deal with sexual problems should be undertaken. Sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of sexual problems in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small, short trial. Switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was small. Further well designed trials and research, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, taking drugs such as Viagra  TM , and switching antipsychotic medication, are much needed.

Antipsychotic drugs block the transmission of dopamine in the brain and reduce the acute symptoms of the disorder. This review examined whether antipsychotic drugs are also effective for relapse prevention. Objectives To review the effects of maintaining antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia compared to withdrawing these agents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Specialised Register (November 2008), with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov (June 2011). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs and placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 65 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 6493 participants comparing antipsychotic medication with placebo. The trials were published from 1959 to 2011 and their size ranged between 14 and 420 participants. In many studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. Although this and other potential sources of bias limited the overall quality, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia was clear. Antipsychotic drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at seven to 12 months (primary outcome; drug 27%, placebo 64%, 24 RCTs, n=2669, RR 0.40 CI 0.33 to 0.49, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB 3 CI 2 to 3).

While L‐carnitine has been reported to enhance cognitive function in some conditions, its efficacy is disputed. The evidence of its efficacy for cognitively healthy people has not previously been systematically reviewed. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of L‐carnitine for the enhancement of cognitive function in people without cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups Specialized Register, on 4 November 2016. We used the search terms L‐carnitine or acetyl‐L‐carnitine or propionyl‐L‐carnitine or ALC or PLC or ALCAR or ALPAR .  We ran additional separate searches in several other sources to ensure that we retrieved the most up‐to‐date results. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised controlled trials identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data. Selection criteria Eligible trials were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs, parallel‐group or cross‐over, that compared L‐carnitine or its derivatives, acetyl‐L‐carnitine or propionyl‐L‐carnitine, at any dose and for any length of treatment, with placebo or no treatment in cognitively healthy people of any age and either gender. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected trials and evaluated the methodological quality, then extracted and analysed data from the included trials. Main results Only two RCTs were eligible. One was a cross‐over trial with 18 participants. The other randomised 400 participants to one of four treatments, of which two (L‐carnitine and placebo) were relevant to this review, but the exact numbers of participants in these two treatment groups was not reported. All participants were young adults. Methodological details were poorly reported, and we considered the risk of bias in both studies to be unclear. The trials assessed different cognitive outcomes. We could extract cognitive data on approximately 200 participants from one trial. We found no evidence that L‐carnitine has any effect on reaction time, vigilance, immediate memory, or delayed recall after three days of treatment. This trial report stated that there was a small number of adverse effects, none of which were serious. The small cross‐over trial also reported no effect of L‐carnitine on cognition, but did not provide data; no information was provided on adverse effects. We considered the available evidence to be of very low quality for all reported outcomes. Authors conclusions Due to the limited number of included trials, short‐term treatment, and inadequate reporting, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of L‐carnitine for cognitive enhancement in healthy adults. Well‐designed, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of L‐carnitine for cognition enhancement in cognitively healthy people, with large samples and relatively long‐term follow‐up, are still needed. Plain language summary L‐carnitine for cognitive enhancement in people without cognitive impairment Background Cognition (or cognitive function) is a term used to describe thinking skills, including attention, memory, and reasoning. Supplements and drugs are sometimes used by healthy people to try to improve cognitive function and perform better at work or while studying. These supplements and drugs are known as cognitive enhancers. L‐carnitine, which is found naturally in the diet, especially in meat, but can also be produced in the body, has been suggested as a possible cognitive enhancer. It is sold on its own as a dietary supplement and is found in some mixed supplements or energy drinks. In this review, we searched for clinical trials in which healthy people taking L‐carnitine were compared with similar people taking a dummy pill (placebo). We hoped to learn whether or not L‐carnitine improves cognitive function and whether it is associated with side effects. Results We found only two trials to include in the review. One trial treated approximately 200 participants with L‐carnitine or placebo for three days; the other trial treated only 18 participants with only a single dose of L‐carnitine. Both trials included healthy young people with an average age of about 21. The trials measured different aspects of cognition using different tests. The smaller trial was only reported as an abstract, and there was no usable data, although the authors said that they found no evidence of an effect of L‐carnitine on cognitive function. Important information was missing from the paper describing the other trial, but we found no evidence that L‐carnitine had any effect on any of the aspects of cognition that were measured. Only the report of the larger trial mentioned adverse effects of treatment, which were all described as minor and occurring equally among those receiving L‐carnitine and those receiving placebo. Quality of the evidence It was difficult to properly assess the quality of the included trials because of poor reporting. We considered there to be a serious risk of bias due to poor study methods, and further uncertainty about the results because the studies were so small. We also considered the studies to be too short to adequately address our research question. Due to these factors, we considered the quality of the evidence to be very low. Conclusions Given the limited amount of evidence of very low quality, we were not able to draw any conclusions about the effect of L‐carnitine on cognitive function or its safety in healthy people. Larger, better‐quality studies conducted over a longer period of time are needed to answer our review question."""

Objectives To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression. Search methods Electronic search of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966‐), EMBASE (1980‐), CINAHL (1982‐), PsycLIT (1974‐), PSYNDEX (1977‐) and LILACS (1982‐1999) and hand searches of major psychiatric and medical journals. Reference search and SciSearch of the identified studies. Personal contact with authors of significant papers. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials 1) comparing low dosage TCA (=< 100 mg/d on average at the end of trial) with placebo or 2) comparing low and standard dosages of the same TCA, in acute phase treatment of depressive disorder Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers examined eligibility of the identified studies, and extracted data for outcomes at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6‐8 weeks and later. Main outcome measures were relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression according to the last‐observation‐carried‐forward intention‐to‐treat method, and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Other outcome measures included worst‐case‐scenario intention‐to‐treat analysis of response as defined above (in which dropouts were considered non‐responders in the active treatment group and as responders in the comparison group), and standardised weighted mean scores of continuous depression severity scales (usually calculated by last‐observation‐carried‐forward method). Main results 35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6‐8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics. Authors conclusions Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of varying dosages. Plain language summary Low dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for depression Practicing physicians and psychiatrists have often been criticised for administering too low a dosage of tricyclic antidepressants for people with depression. This systematic review of 39 studies (2564 participants) found that tricyclic antidepressants between 75‐100 mg/day and possibly below this range result in more reduction in depression than placebo. On the other hand, there was no strong evidence to show that standard dosage tricyclic brings about more response than low dosage tricyclic. The findings suggest that administration of low dosage tricyclic antidepressant is a defensible practice."""

The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review ‐ one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD ‐ focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non‐pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery and form of light vary. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second‐generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD and improving patient‐centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library ,  the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. Selection criteria For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter‐type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non‐randomised studies. We intended to include studies that compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus no treatment/placebo, second‐generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes, negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy in combination with any comparator intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications, independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Main results We identified 3745 citations after de‐duplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review. We assessed 126 full‐text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria. The included RCT had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis. The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light treatment. Overall, white light and infrared light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy. In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and 67% (6/9) in the non‐treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38; 23 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy, but the CI was also too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; 24 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Comparison of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28; 29 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Reasons for downgrading evidence quality included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self‐rating of outcomes, lack of checking of compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions of interest such as second‐generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. Authors conclusions Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for people with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Plain language summary Light therapy for prevention of winter depression Why is this review important? Many people in northern latitudes suffer from winter blues, which occurs as a reaction to reduced sunlight. Three‐quarters of those affected are women. Lethargy, overeating, craving for carbohydrates and depressed mood are common symptoms. In some people, winter blues becomes depression, which seriously affects their daily lives. Up to two‐thirds experience depressive symptoms every winter. Who will be interested in this review? Anyone who has experienced winter depression, or who has relatives and friends who have experienced winter depression. What questions does this review aim to answer? In light of the seasonal pattern and the high rate of recurrence, beginning light therapy in early autumn (fall) when people are still free of depressive symptoms could help to prevent the onset of depressed mood. The goal of this review was to find out whether light therapy can prevent the onset of depression in winter when it is used in healthy people with a history of winter depression, and if it is safe. To date, this question has not been examined in a systematic way, but it is of importance for those who have suffered winter depression. Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases up to 19 June 2018 for studies on light therapy to prevent winter depression. Among 3745 records, we found one randomised controlled study including 46 people who received light therapy or no treatment. All individuals in these studies had a history of winter depression. What does the evidence from the review reveal? The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low, so we can draw no conclusions about whether light therapy is effective in preventing winter depression. The included study provided no information on side effects of light therapy. Doctors need to discuss with patients considering preventive treatment the advantages and disadvantages of light therapy and other potentially preventive treatments for winter depression, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions. As no available studies have compared these treatments, treatment selection should be strongly based on patient preferences. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that future studies should directly compare light therapy versus other treatments, such as drug treatments, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions to determine the best treatment for preventing winter depression."""

The illness can reduce the ability of self‐care and functioning and can lead to the illness becoming disabling. Life skills programmes, emphasising the needs associated with independent functioning, are often a part of the rehabilitation process. These programmes have been developed to enhance independent living and quality of life for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of life skills programmes compared with standard care or other comparable therapies for people with chronic mental health problems. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010). We supplemented this process with handsearching and scrutiny of references. We inspected references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials for life skills programmes versus other comparable therapies or standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 483 participants. These evaluated life skills programmes versus standard care, or support group. We found no significant difference in life skills performance between people given life skills training and standard care (1 RCT, n = 32, MD ‐1.10; 95% CI ‐7.82 to 5.62). Life skills training did not improve or worsen study retention (5 RCTs, n = 345, RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.40 to 3.36). We found no significant difference in PANSS positive, negative or total scores between life skills intervention and standard care. We found quality of life scores to be equivocal between participants given life skills training (1 RCT, n = 32, MD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.03) and standard care. Life skills compared with support groups also did not reveal any significant differences in PANSS scores, quality of life, or social performance skills (1 RCT, n = 158, MD ‐0.90; 95% CI ‐3.39 to 1.59). Authors conclusions Currently there is no good evidence to suggest life skills programmes are effective for people with chronic mental illnesses. More robust data are needed from studies that are adequately powered to determine whether life skills training is beneficial for people with chronic mental health problems. Plain language summary Life skills programmes for chronic mental illnesses Having a mental health problem can cause difficulties and obstacles in all areas of life, even those as simple as washing, shopping, talking openly with other people, brushing teeth, cleaning the house, managing money, making friends, shaving and being independent. Having a mental health problem, combined with the sleep‐like haze of many antipsychotic medications, limits people’s ability to look after themselves, socialise with other people, take part in education or career development and find work.  Life skills programmes attempt to remedy some of these difficulties by encouraging independent living, so enhancing quality of life. Life skills often have several components"""

Objectives To determine the clinical effects and safety of levomepromazine compared with placebo or antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (December 2008) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised trials comparing levomepromazine with placebo or other antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophreniform psychoses were included. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated relative risk (RR) (random‐effects model), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. We avoided the use of number needed to harm (NNH), as an alternative we used number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) to indicate the direction of effect. For continuous outcomes, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results The review currently includes 4 RCTs with 192 participants. For our primary outcome of leaving the study early, levomepromazine was not significantly different compared with other antipsychotics. The levomepromazine arm was significantly better on CGI severity compared with chlorpromazine (n=38, 1 RCT, WMD ‐0.80 CI ‐1.51 to ‐0.09). Risperidone was better for CGI endpoint scores (n=42, 1 RCT, RR 2.33 CI 1.11 to 4.89, NNT 3 CI 2 to 10) compared with levomepromazine. Recipients given levomepromazine had a better BPRS endpoint score (n=38, 1 RCT, WMD ‐9.00, CI ‐17.46 to ‐0.54) and PANSS total score (n=38, 1 RCT, WMD ‐15.90, CI ‐30.30 to ‐1.50) than chlorpromazine. Risperidone recipients noticed a significant difference for the outcome at least 20% reduction on BPRS endpoint score (n=42, 1 RCT, RR 3.33 CI 1.07 to 10.42, NNT 3 CI 2 to 14) compared with levomepromazine. Levomepromazine caused less tremor (n=41, 1 RCT RR 0.12 CI 0.02 to 0.87 NNTB 3 CI 2 to 8), less antiparkinsonian medication administration (n=79, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.17 to 0.90, NNTB 5, CI 2 to 21) compared with haloperidol. Levomepromazine caused less akathisia compared with chlorpromazine, but more hypotension compared with risperidone (n=42, 1 RCT, RR 2.50 CI 1.21 to 5.18, NNTH 3, CI 2 to 7). Dizziness was common with levomepromazine compared with other antipsychotic medications. Authors conclusions Available data does not enable us to confidently comment on the effectiveness of levomepromazine for schizophrenia. Larger, more robust, studies comparing levomepromazine with other antipsychotics including clozapine are much needed. Plain language summary Levomepromazine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a profoundly disabling mental illness affecting thoughts, emotions and behaviour. It has a life time prevalence of about 1%. Antipsychotic medications still remain as the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical subtypes. First generation or typical antipsychotic medications have been the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia for decades and have been effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms have been fairly resistant to treatment. With the advent of atypical antipsychotics there has been a surge in prescriptions of the atypical antipsychotic medications in recent years. Levomepromazine is one among these older typical antipsychotic medications. We systematically reviewed the effects of levomepromazine in comparison to other typical and atypical antipsychotic medications for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like disorders. We were able to include four studies in our systematic review."""

Adding lamotrigine to ongoing antipsychotic treatment has shown to be of benefit in preliminary studies. Objectives To evaluate the effects of adjuvant lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (February 2006) and inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all clinical randomised trials comparing lamotrigine with placebo or other antipsychotic augmentation strategies. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results We found five relevant trials (total n=537), but no usable data on service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment or economic outcomes. Overall, reporting of data was poor. Those data we were able to use suggested that equal proportions of people allocated lamotrigine or placebo had no global response (n=208, 1 RCT, RR 1.06 CI 0.73 to 1.54). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of people whose mental state did not improve (n=297, 3 RCT, RR 1.26 CI 0.81 to 1.97). There was, however, a significant reduction in the PANSS total scores (n=67, 2 RCT, WMD ‐16.88 CI ‐8.57 to ‐25.18, p=0.0001), positive symptom sub‐scale scores (n=65, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐5.10 CI ‐8.86 to ‐1.34) and negative symptom sub‐scale scores (n=67, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐5.25, CI ‐7.07 to ‐3.43). Most cognitive measures showed no differences (n=329, 2 RCTs, RR not attaining BACS composite score of 0.5 1.10 CI 0.59 to 2.04). The proportion of participants leaving studies was about 25% at 12 weeks (n=537, 5 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.71 to 1.29). The lamotrigine group did experience the outcome of any adverse effects significantly more frequent than people allocated placebo (n=429, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19 CI 1.02 to 1.38, NNH 10 CI 5 to 90). Among the many effects listed, only nausea was found to be significantly more (9%) in the lamotrigine group compared with placebo (n=465, 3 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 1.05 to 4.88). Authors conclusions Evidence for use of lamotrigine as an adjuvant for people with schizophrenia is not robust and large well‐designed, conducted and reported real‐world randomised trials are needed to determine its place in everyday clinical practice. Plain language summary Lamotrigine for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder affecting about 1% of the general population. The symptoms of the disorder significantly affect the social, occupational and interpersonal functioning of the affected person. In spite of promising treatments for schizophrenia over the last fifty years, at least one‐fifth to one‐third of affected people fail to respond to treatment. In such cases, additional drugs may be administered to improve treatment response. One such drug is lamotrigine, which was introduced primarily for epilepsy (fits). So far there has not been any systematic analysis of those reports that have suggested the benefit of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia, hence we undertook this review. We searched major medical databases for studies that have examined the use of lamotrigine for people with schizophrenia. We identified five relevant studies that were conducted according to existing standards of research. A total of 537 people with schizophrenia participated in these five studies. The participants were resistant to various degrees to usual treatments and were randomised to receive either lamotrigine or placebo in addition to their usual drugs. The data regarding effectiveness could only be usefully analysed in less than 70 participants. Lamotrigine was considered to be effective if the questionnaire scores showed a greater reduction than for those who received placebo. The magnitude of this effect was small when compared to placebo. Data regarding adverse effects were available from three studies. There was a higher occurrence of nausea in those receiving lamotrigine. Apart from this the common side effects were headache and dizziness. The current evidence does not suggest that the addition of lamotrigine is a remarkable strategy for people with resistant schizophrenia, but the results are suggestive of a positive effect on the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, more studies with larger number of participants are needed to confirm the true magnitude of benefit and safety. This review is limited by the poor presentation of data from the individual studies."""

Objectives To determine the effects of both pharmacological (excluding medication switching) and non pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups trials register (April 2006), reference sections within relevant papers, hand searched key journals, and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information. Selection criteria We included all clinical randomised controlled trials comparing any pharmacological or non pharmacological intervention for weight gain (diet and exercise counselling) with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from studies. As weight is a continuous outcome measurement, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the change from baseline were calculated. The primary outcome measure was weight loss. Main results Twenty‐three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Five trials assessed a cognitive/behavioural intervention and eighteen assessed a pharmacological adjunct. In terms of prevention, two cognitive/behavioural trials showed significant treatment effect (mean weight change) at end of treatment (n=104, 2 RCTs, WMD ‐3.38 kg CI ‐4.2 to ‐2.0). Pharmacological adjunct treatments were significant with a modest prevention of weight gain (n=274, 6 RCTs, WMD ‐ 1.16 kg CI ‐1.9 to ‐0.4). In terms of treatments for weight loss, we found significantly greater weight reduction in the cognitive behavioural intervention group (n=129, 3 RCTs, WMD ‐1.69 kg CI ‐2.8 to ‐0.6) compared with standard care. Authors conclusions Modest weight loss can be achieved with selective pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions. However, interpretation is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, short study duration and by variability of the interventions themselves, their intensity and duration. Future studies adequately powered, with longer treatment duration and rigorous methodology will be needed in further evaluating the efficacy and safety of weight loss interventions for moderating weight gain. At this stage, there is insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacological interventions for weight management in people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Interventions to reduce weight gain in schizophrenia Weight gain and obesity is a common problem for people with schizophrenia and both pharmacological (medication) and non pharmacological (diet/exercise) interventions have been tried to treat this problem. In this review we are able to show that small weight loss is possible with selective pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions but it is difficult to be sure of the results because the studies were small and compared different interventions over different time periods."""

Objectives To assess the effects of interventions facilitating RTW for workers with acute or chronic adjustment disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Groups Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to Issue 4, 2011; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science, all years to February 2011; the WHO trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov in March 2011. We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to facilitate RTW of workers with adjustment disorders compared to no or other treatment. Eligible interventions were pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and problem solving therapy), relaxation techniques, exercise programmes, employee assistance programmes or combinations of these interventions. The primary outcomes were time to partial and time to full RTW, and secondary outcomes were severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder, work functioning, generic functional status (i.e. the overall functional capabilities of an individual, such as physical functioning, social function, general mental health) and quality of life. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies that we deemed sufficiently clinically homogeneous in different comparison groups, and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included nine studies reporting on 10 psychological interventions and one combined intervention. The studies included 1546 participants. No RCTs were found of pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. We assessed seven studies as having low risk of bias and the studies that were pooled together were comparable. For those who received no treatment, compared with CBT, the assumed time to partial and full RTW was 88 and 252 days respectively. Based on two studies with a total of 159 participants, moderate‐quality evidence showed that CBT had similar results for time (measured in days) until partial RTW compared to no treatment at one‐year follow‐up (mean difference (MD) ‐8.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐23.26 to 5.71). We found low‐quality evidence of similar results for CBT and no treatment on the reduction of days until full RTW at one‐year follow‐up (MD ‐35.73, 95% CI ‐113.15 to 41.69) (one study with 105 participants included in the analysis). Based on moderate‐quality evidence, problem solving therapy (PST) significantly reduced time until partial RTW at one‐year follow‐up compared to non‐guideline based care (MD ‐17.00, 95% CI ‐26.48 to ‐7.52) (one study with 192 participants clustered among 33 treatment providers included in the analysis), but we found moderate‐quality evidence of no significant effect on reducing days until full RTW at one‐year follow‐up (MD ‐17.73, 95% CI ‐37.35 to 1.90) (two studies with 342 participants included in the analysis). Authors conclusions We found moderate‐quality evidence that CBT did not significantly reduce time until partial RTW and low‐quality evidence that it did not significantly reduce time to full RTW compared with no treatment. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that PST significantly enhanced partial RTW at one‐year follow‐up compared to non‐guideline based care but did not significantly enhance time to full RTW at one‐year follow‐up. An important limitation was the small number of studies included in the meta‐analyses and the small number of participants, which lowered the power of the analyses. Plain language summary Improving return to work in adults suffering from symptoms of distress Adjustment disorders, characterised by distress symptoms and emotional disturbance as a reaction to a significant life change or stressful life event, are a frequent cause of sick leave among workers. Apart from the negative consequences for the worker, sick leave poses a heavy burden on society due to the loss of productivity of the worker and work disability claims. Different treatments have been developed to help such workers return to work. Our study assessed how effective these treatments are at enabling the sick‐listed worker to return to partial or full‐time work. We searched databases containing articles from different scientific journals and looked for studies that tested whether a certain type of treatment helped the worker to return to work when on sick leave because of an adjustment disorder. We found nine relevant studies. In total, 10 psychological treatments were evaluated and one combined treatment consisting of a psychological treatment and relaxation techniques. We found no studies on pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. The nine studies included in this review reported in total on 1546 participants. Of the 10 psychological treatments, five consisted of cognitive behavioural therapy and five of problem solving therapy, which are commonly used types of treatment for patients with mental health problems. Our results showed that workers on sick leave because of an adjustment disorder can be helped with making their first step back to work (i.e. partial return to work) by treating them with problem solving therapy. On average, workers who are offered problem solving therapy start 17 days earlier with partial return to work compared to workers who receive no treatment or the usual treatment from their occupational physician or general practitioner. However, we also found that cognitive behavioural therapy or problem solving therapy does not help the worker return to work with full‐time hours any quicker than workers who receive no treatment or the usual treatment from their occupational physicians or general practitioners. These results are based on moderate‐quality evidence, which implies that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the results and may change the results."""

There may be a prodromal period or stage of psychosis, where early signs of symptoms indicating onset of first episode psychosis (FEP) occur. A number of services, incorporating multimodal treatment approaches (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions), developed worldwide, now focus on this prodromal period with the aim of preventing psychosis in people at risk of developing FEP. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of early interventions for people in the prodromal stage of psychosis. The secondary objective is, if possible, to compare the effectiveness of the various different interventions. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenias study‐based Register of studies (including trials registers) on 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for participants older than 12 years, who had developed a prodromal stage of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Main results We included 20 studies with 2151 participants. The studies analysed 13 different comparisons. Group A comparisons explored the absolute effects of the experimental intervention. Group B were comparisons within which we could not be clear whether differential interactive effects were also ongoing. Group C comparisons explored differential effects between clearly distinct treatments. A key outcome for this review was ‘transition to psychosis’. For details of other main outcomes please see Summary of findings tables. In Group A (comparisons of absolute effects) we found no clear difference between amino acids and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). When omega‐3 fatty acids were compared to placebo, fewer participants given the omega‐3 (10%) transitioned to psychosis compared to the placebo group (33%) during long‐term follow‐up of seven years (RR 0.24 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 81 participants; low‐quality evidence). In Group B (comparisons where complex interactions are probable) and in the subgroup focusing on antipsychotic drugs added to specific care packages, the amisulpiride + needs‐focused intervention (NFI) compared to NFI comparison (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 102 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and the olanzapine + supportive intervention compared to supportive intervention alone comparison (RR 0.58 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 60 participants; very low‐quality evidence) showed no clear differences between groups. In the second Group B subgroup (cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT)), when CBT + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy group transitioned to psychosis during follow‐up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in the supportive therapy alone group (RR 0.45 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89; 2 RCTs, 252 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The CBT + risperidone versus CBT + placebo comparison identified no clear difference between treatments (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.39 to 2.67; 1 RCT, 87 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and this also applies to the CBT + needs‐based intervention (NBI) + risperidone versus NBI comparison (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.39 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 59 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Group C (differential effects) also involved six comparisons. The first compared CBT with supportive therapy. No clear difference was found for the ‘transition to psychosis’ outcome (RR 0.74 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98; 1 RCT, 72 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The second subgroup compared CBT + supportive intervention was compared with a NBI + supportive intervention, again, data were equivocal, few and of very low quality (RR 6.32 95% CI 0.34 to 117.09; 1 RCT, 57 participants). In the CBT + risperidone versus supportive therapy comparison, again there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; 1 RCT, 71 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The three other comparisons in Group C demonstrated no clear differences between treatment groups. When cognitive training was compared to active control (tablet games) (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 62 participants; very low quality data), family treatment compared with enhanced care comparison (RR 0.54 95% CI 0.18 to 1.59; 2 RCTs, 229 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and integrated treatment compared to standard treatment comparison (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 79 participants; very low‐quality evidence) no effects of any of these approaches was evident. Authors conclusions There has been considerable research effort in this area and several interventions have been trialled. The evidence available suggests that omega‐3 fatty acids may prevent transition to psychosis but this evidence is low quality and more research is needed to confirm this finding. Other comparisons did not show any clear differences in effect for preventing transition to psychosis but again, the quality of this evidence is very low or low and not strong enough to make firm conclusions. Plain language summary Early interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis Review question Is there high‐quality evidence indicating that interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis are effective? Background Psychoses are serious mental conditions characterised by a loss of contact with reality. The first clear episode of psychosis can be preceded by a prodromal period of at least six months, where a person experiences gradual non‐specific changes in thoughts, perceptions, behaviours and functioning. Although an individual is experiencing changes, they have not yet started to experience the more obvious psychotic symptoms such as delusions (fixed false beliefs) or hallucinations (perceptions without a cause). A number of services with treatment approaches that combine pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial treatments, developed worldwide, are now focusing on prevention of psychosis in people at risk by giving treatments during this prodromal period. This review assesses the evidence available concerning the effects of different treatment approaches for people not yet diagnosed with a non affective psychosis but who are in the prodromal stage of psychosis. Searching for evidence On 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017 we ran electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenias specialised register of studies in order to find clinical studies that randomly allocated individuals at risk of developing psychosis to receive various treatments for preventing development of psychosis. Evidence found We were able to include 20 studies with 2151 participants. These studies analysed a wide range of treatments. All the review findings are of, at very best, low quality. There is some suggestion from one small study that people at risk of psychosis may benefit from taking omega‐3 fatty acids in terms of reduced transition to psychosis. Other studies found adding antipsychotic drugs to supportive‐care packages did not seem to make much difference in terms of transition to full illness. When cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants treated allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy transitioned to psychosis during follow‐up by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in people who just received supportive therapy. This could be important but these data are of very low quality. All other testing of CBT and other packages of care found no clear difference between treatments for transition to psychosis. Conclusions There has been considerable effort and expense invested testing treatment approaches for prevention of the first episode of schizophrenia. Currently, there is some low‐quality evidence suggesting that omega‐3 fatty acids may be effective, but there is no high‐quality evidence to suggest that any type of treatment is effective, and no firm conclusions can be made."""

There is a growing body of evidence supporting effective treatments during the acute phase of a depressive disorder. However, little is known about treatments for preventing relapse or recurrence of depression once an individual has achieved remission or recovery from their symptoms. Objectives To determine the efficacy of early interventions, including psychological and pharmacological interventions, to prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Groups Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (to 1 June 2011). The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from  The Cochrane Library  (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition we handsearched the references of all included studies and review articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials using a psychological or pharmacological intervention, with the aim of preventing relapse or recurrence from an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymic disorder (DD) in children and adolescents were included. Participants were required to have been diagnosed with MDD or DD according to DSM or ICD criteria, using a standardised and validated assessment tool. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed all trials for inclusion in the review, extracted trial and outcome data, and assessed trial quality. Results for dichotomous outcomes are expressed as odds ratio and continuous measures as mean difference or standardised mean difference. We combined results using random‐effects meta‐analyses, with 95% confidence intervals. We contacted lead authors of included trials and requested additional data where possible. Main results Nine trials with 882 participants were included in the review. In five trials the outcome assessors were blind to the participants intervention condition and in the remainder of trials it was unclear. In the majority of trials, participants were either not blind to their intervention condition, or it was unclear whether they were or not. Allocation concealment was also unclear in the majority of trials. Although all trials treated participants in an outpatient setting, the designs implemented in trials was diverse, which limits the generalisability of the results. Three trials indicated participants treated with antidepressant medication had lower relapse‐recurrence rates (40.9%) compared to those treated with placebo (66.6%) during a relapse prevention phase (odds ratio (OR) 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.64, P = 0.02). One trial that compared a combination of psychological therapy and medication to medication alone favoured a combination approach over medication alone, however this result did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.15). The majority of trials that involved antidepressant medication reported adverse events including suicide‐related behaviours. However, there were not enough data to show which treatment approach results in the most favourable adverse event profile. Authors conclusions Currently, there is little evidence to conclude which type of treatment approach is most effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of depressive episodes in children and adolescents. Limited trials found that antidepressant medication reduces the chance of relapse‐recurrence in the future, however, there is considerable diversity in the design of trials, making it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Some of the research involving psychological therapies is encouraging, however at present more trials with larger sample sizes need to be conducted in order to explore this treatment approach further. Plain language summary Treatments for preventing the recurrence of depression in children and adolescents Many children and adolescents diagnosed with a depressive disorder will experience a relapse or recurrence of their symptoms. Little is known about what treatment approach works best to prevent this from occurring, once a child or adolescent has initially remitted or recovered from a depressive episode. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of early interventions, including psychological, social and pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse or recurrence of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.The review included nine studies that assessed the efficacy of antidepressant medication and psychological therapies in reducing the risk of a future depressive episode in children and adolescents. Trials varied in their quality and methodological design, limiting conclusions that could be drawn from the result. Overall, the review found that antidepressant medication reduces the chance that children and adolescents will experience another episode of depression, compared with a pill placebo. Psychological therapies also look promising as a treatment to prevent future depressive episodes, however given the aforementioned issues concerning trial quality and design, along with the small number of trials included in the review, it is unclear how effective these therapies are at present."""

It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long‐term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care settings. Search methods We searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) ’s Specialised Register of dementia trials ( dementia.cochrane.org/our‐trials‐register ), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost‐related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time‐to‐event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster‐RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non‐pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary. It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration‐based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12‐month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant‐months; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant‐months; low‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness). Authors conclusions Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC. A software‐based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist‐led medication review, probably reduces incidence of delirium in older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the US and may not be practical in other countries or settings which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. In the educational intervention aimed at identifying risk factors for delirium and developing bespoke solutions within care homes, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence, prevalence or mortality. This evidence is based on a small feasibility trial. Our review identified three ongoing trials of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. We identified no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of multicomponent non‐pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence‐based care for this vulnerable group. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long‐term care (LTC) Review question How effective are treatments to prevent delirium in older people living in long‐term care (LTC)? Background LTC is the name used for residential homes, which provide personal care, supervision with medications and help with day‐to‐day activities, and nursing homes, which provide 24‐hour nursing care. Delirium is a common and serious illness for older people living in LTC. Delirium is a condition that causes confusion, usually over a few hours or days. Some people with delirium become quiet and sleepy while others become agitated and disorientated, so it can be a very distressing condition. Delirium can increase the chances of being admitted to hospital, developing dementia and can increase the risk of death. Importantly, studies of people in hospital have shown that it is possible to prevent around a third of cases of delirium by providing an environment and care plan that target the main delirium risk factors, including, providing better lighting and signs to avoid disorientation; avoiding unnecessary use of catheters to help prevent infection; and avoiding certain medications which increase the risk of delirium. This review has searched for and assessed research on preventing delirium in older people living in LTC. Study characteristics The evidence is current to February 2019. We found three studies that included 3851 participants. Two studies took place in the US and one study in the UK. One study tested whether delirium could be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring hydration was maintained. There were 98 people in the study, which lasted four weeks. One study tested the effect of a computer program which searched for prescriptions of medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium, to enable a pharmacist to adjust or stop them. There were 3538 people in the study, which lasted 12 months. One study tested an enhanced educational intervention which included learning sessions on delirium with care home staff and group meetings to identity targets for preventing delirium. There were 215 people in the study, which lasted 16 months. Key findings It was not possible to determine if the hydration intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium. This was a small study of short duration with serious design problems. The study of a computerised medication search programme probably reduced delirium, but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls. A potential problem is that it might not be possible to use this computer program in different countries that do not have similar computer systems available. It was not possible to determine if the enhanced education intervention reduced the occurrence of delirium and there was no clear reduction in the number of deaths. The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions. This is based on findings from a small study. Quality of the evidence There is very low‐quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme may reduce the incidence of delirium. There is no clear evidence for reducing hospitalisations, mortality or falls. There is very low‐quality evidence of the effectiveness of an enhanced educational intervention for reducing delirium. Therefore, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions. There is moderate‐quality evidence for reducing hospital admissions. As this review only found a small number of research studies, we recommend that further research be conducted, testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people in LTC."""

The benefit of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment of cognitive deficits in this population is unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing or ameliorating cognitive deficits in adult patients treated with cranial irradiation. Search methods In August 2014. we searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO and checked the reference lists of included studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov, the Physicians Data Query and the Meta Register of Controlled Trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions in cranial irradiated adults, with objective cognitive functioning as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (JD, KZ) independently extracted data from selected studies and carried out a Risk of bias assessment. Cognitive function, fatigue and mood outcomes were reported. No data were pooled. Main results Sixteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review, six of which were included. Three studies investigated prevention and three studies investigated amelioration. Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta‐analysis was not possible. Two studies investigated a pharmacological intervention for the prevention of cognitive deficits; memantine compared with placebo, and d‐threo‐methylphenidate HCL compared with placebo. In the first study the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups. The second study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events. The third study investigated a rehabilitation program for the prevention of cognitive deficits but did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups. Three studies investigated the use of a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of cognitive deficits; methylphenidate compared with modafinil, two different doses of modafinil, and donepezil compared with placebo. The first study found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported. The second study combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported. Both studies were limited by a small sample size. The third study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported. No non‐pharmacological studies for the amelioration of cognitive deficits were eligible. There were a number of limitations across studies but few without high risks of bias. Authors conclusions There is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation. There is supportive evidence that donepezil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with primary or metastatic brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation. Patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of both studies. Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher quality of evidence. There is no strong evidence to support any non‐pharmacological interventions (medical or cognitive/behavioural) in the prevention or amelioration of cognitive deficits. Non‐randomised studies appear promising but are as yet to be conclusive via translation into high quality evidence. Further research is required. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing and ameliorating cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation Background Problems with mental activities (cognitive deficits) are common in patients who have received radiation to the brain for a primary or secondary (metastatic) brain tumour, or to help prevent a tumour spreading to the brain from elsewhere in the body. This toxic side effect of brain radiation may be acute (during treatment) or early after treatment (one to six months) and may be reversible. However, late toxicities may occur many months or years later and are generally irreversible and are slowly progressive. Late cognitive deficits, such as memory loss, problems planning tasks or behavioural changes, can have a serious impact on quality of life and the ability to carrying out activities normally. Interventions to help prevent or treat these late radiation toxicities may improve a patients well‐being. Study Characteristics In August 2014 we searched four literature databases. Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in which patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or a comparison group (control group), were eligible for inclusion. Each trial assessed different interventions, so results were not combined. The largest trial investigated the medical drug memantine in 508 patients with a metastatic brain tumour. Another trial investigated donepezil in 198 patients with a primary or secondary brain tumour. The other trials were smaller and investigated modafinil and methylphenidate. We found one psychological intervention for preventing cognitive deficits during brain radiation. There is one ongoing medical drug trial recruiting participants. There were many non‐randomised and non‐controlled trials that offer promising results for further exploration using an RCT method. Key findings Findings into the efficacy of memantine offer supportive evidence for preventing cognitive deficits in patients with a secondary brain tumour receiving brain irradiation. Findings into the efficacy of donepezil offer some support for its use in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in patients with a primary or secondary tumour previously treated with radiation. The remaining studies did not have a sufficient number of participants to provide reliable results. The drugs used had few side effects (adverse events), although these were not reported well. Recruitment and retention of trial participants for these medical drug studies is difficult. Quality of the evidence We found limitations in the evidence across studies, most medical drug randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, whereas the psychological interventions were at a high risk of bias."""

People with severe mental illness used to be placed in sheltered employment or were enrolled in prevocational training to facilitate transition to a competitive job. Now, there are also interventions focusing on rapid search for a competitive job, with ongoing support to keep the job, known as supported employment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining supported employment with other prevocational or psychiatric interventions. Objectives To assess the comparative effectiveness of various types of vocational rehabilitation interventions and to rank these interventions according to their effectiveness to facilitate competitive employment in adults with severe mental illness. Search methods In November 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and CINAHL, and reference lists of articles for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews. We identified systematic reviews from which to extract randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials and cluster‐randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of interventions on obtaining competitive employment for adults with severe mental illness. We included trials with competitive employment outcomes. The main intervention groups were prevocational training programmes, transitional employment interventions, supported employment, supported employment augmented with other specific interventions, and psychiatric care only. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently identified trials, performed data extraction, including adverse events, and assessed trial quality. We performed direct meta‐analyses and a network meta‐analysis including measurements of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). We assessed the quality of the evidence for outcomes within the network meta‐analysis according to GRADE. Main results We included 48 randomised controlled trials involving 8743 participants. Of these, 30 studied supported employment, 13 augmented supported employment, 17 prevocational training, and 6 transitional employment. Psychiatric care only was the control condition in 13 studies. Direct comparison meta‐analysis of obtaining competitive employment We could include 18 trials with short‐term follow‐up in a direct meta‐analysis (N = 2291) of the following comparisons. Supported employment was more effective than prevocational training (RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.24) and transitional employment (RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.77 to 6.89) and prevocational training was more effective than psychiatric care only (RR 8.96, 95% CI 1.77 to 45.51) in obtaining competitive employment. For the long‐term follow‐up direct meta‐analysis, we could include 22 trials (N = 5233). Augmented supported employment (RR 4.32, 95% CI 1.49 to 12.48), supported employment (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.68) and prevocational training (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.46) were more effective than psychiatric care only. Augmented supported employment was more effective than supported employment (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.65), transitional employment (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.55) and prevocational training (RR 5.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 27.11). Supported employment was more effective than transitional employment (RR 3.28, 95% CI 2.13 to 5.04) and prevocational training (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.89). Network meta‐analysis of obtaining competitive employment We could include 22 trials with long‐term follow‐up in a network meta‐analysis. Augmented supported employment was the most effective intervention versus psychiatric care only in obtaining competitive employment (RR 3.81, 95% CI 1.99 to 7.31, SUCRA 98.5, moderate‐quality evidence), followed by supported employment (RR 2.72 95% CI 1.55 to 4.76; SUCRA 76.5, low‐quality evidence). Prevocational training (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.19; SUCRA 40.3, very low‐quality evidence) and transitional employment were not considerably different from psychiatric care only (RR 1.00,95% CI 0.51 to 1.96; SUCRA 17.2, low‐quality evidence) in achieving competitive employment, but prevocational training stood out in the SUCRA value and rank. Augmented supported employment was slightly better than supported employment, but not significantly (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.14). The SUCRA value and mean rank were higher for augmented supported employment. The results of the network meta‐analysis of the intervention subgroups favoured augmented supported employment interventions, but also cognitive training. However, supported employment augmented with symptom‐related skills training showed the best results (RR compared to psychiatric care only 3.61 with 95% CI 1.03 to 12.63, SUCRA 80.3). We graded the quality of the evidence of the network ranking as very low because of potential risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency and publication bias.

Many people under the care of the criminal justice system have co‐occurring mental health problems and drug misuse problems; it is important to identify the most effective treatments for this vulnerable population. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems in reducing criminal activity or drug use, or both. This review addresses the following questions. • Does any treatment for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems reduce drug use? • Does any treatment for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems reduce criminal activity? • Does the treatment setting (court, community, prison/secure establishment) affect intervention outcome(s)? • Does the type of treatment affect treatment outcome(s)? Search methods We searched 12 databases up to February 2019 and checked the reference lists of included studies. We contacted experts in the field for further information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials designed to prevent relapse of drug use and/or criminal activity among drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane . Main results We included 13 studies with a total of 2606 participants. Interventions were delivered in prison (eight studies; 61%), in court (two studies; 15%), in the community (two studies; 15%), or at a medium secure hospital (one study; 8%). Main sources of bias were unclear risk of selection bias and high risk of detection bias. Four studies compared a therapeutic community intervention versus (1) treatment as usual (two studies; 266 participants), providing moderate‐certainty evidence that participants who received the intervention were less likely to be involved in subsequent criminal activity (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.84) or returned to prison (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67); (2) a cognitive‐behavioural therapy (one study; 314 participants), reporting no significant reduction in self‐reported drug use (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.32), re‐arrest for any type of crime (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09), criminal activity (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05), or drug‐related crime (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), yielding low‐certainty evidence; and (3) a waiting list control (one study; 478 participants), showing a significant reduction in return to prison for those people engaging in the therapeutic community (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79), providing moderate‐certainty evidence. One study (235 participants) compared a mental health treatment court with an assertive case management model versus treatment as usual, showing no significant reduction at 12 months follow‐up on an Addictive Severity Index (ASI) self‐report of drug use (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.03), conviction for a new crime (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22), or re‐incarceration to jail (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01), providing low‐certainty evidence. Four studies compared motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills with relaxation therapy (one study), a waiting list control (one study), or treatment as usual (two studies). In comparison to relaxation training, one study reported narrative information on marijuana use at three‐month follow‐up assessment. Researchers reported a main effect < .007 with participants in the motivational interviewing group, showing fewer problems than participants in the relaxation training group, with moderate‐certainty evidence. In comparison to a waiting list control, one study reported no significant reduction in self‐reported drug use based on the ASI (MD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.29) and on abstinence from drug use (RR 2.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 11.43), presenting low‐certainty evidence at six months (31 participants). In comparison to treatment as usual, two studies (with 40 participants) found no significant reduction in frequency of marijuana use at three months post release (MD ‐1.05, 95% CI ‐2.39 to 0.29) nor time to first arrest (MD 0.87, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 1.86), along with a small reduction in frequency of re‐arrest (MD ‐0.66, 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.01) up to 36 months, yielding low‐certainty evidence; the other study with 80 participants found no significant reduction in positive drug screens at 12 months (MD ‐0.7, 95% CI ‐3.5 to 2.1), providing very low‐certainty evidence. Two studies reported on the use of multi‐systemic therapy involving juveniles and families versus treatment as usual and adolescent substance abuse therapy. In comparing treatment as usual, researchers found no significant reduction up to seven months in drug dependence on the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) score (MD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐2.51 to 2.07) nor in arrests (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36), providing low‐certainty evidence (156 participants). In comparison to an adolescent substance abuse therapy, one study (112 participants) found significant reduction in re‐arrests up to 24 months (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.28), based on low‐certainty evidence. One study (38 participants) reported on the use of interpersonal psychotherapy in comparison to a psychoeducational intervention. Investigators found no significant reduction in self‐reported drug use at three months (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50), providing very low‐certainty evidence. The final study (29 participants) compared legal defence service and wrap‐around social work services versus legal defence service only and found no significant reductions in the number of new offences committed at 12 months (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.01), yielding very low‐certainty evidence. Authors conclusions Therapeutic community interventions and mental health treatment courts may help people to reduce subsequent drug use and/or criminal activity. For other interventions such as interpersonal psychotherapy, multi‐systemic therapy, legal defence wrap‐around services, and motivational interviewing, the evidence is more uncertain. Studies showed a high degree of variation, warranting a degree of caution in interpreting the magnitude of effect and the direction of benefit for treatment outcomes. Plain language summary Interventions for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems What is the aim? To identify therapies to reduce drug use and/or criminal activity among criminal justice involved people with mental health problems. What is the key message? Therapeutic community interventions and mental health treatment courts may help people to reduce subsequent drug use and/or criminal activity. What was studied? Therapies identified to support criminal justice involved people with mental health and drug misuse problems. What are the results? ￭ When men engage with a therapeutic community intervention compared to treatment as usual, they are probably less likely to be re‐arrested or return to prison (moderate‐certainty). ￭ When women engage with a therapeutic community intervention compared to a cognitive‐behavioural course, they may not be more likely to reduce drug use, or become involved in criminal activity/drug‐related crimes (low‐certainty). ￭ When men engage with a therapeutic community compared to no intervention, they are probably less likely to return to prison (moderate‐certainty). ￭ When juveniles engage with a mental health court compared to treatment as usual, they may be less likely to commit a new crime, return to prison, or take drugs (low‐certainty). ￭ When juveniles engage with motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills, they are probably less likely to show fewer problems than receiving relaxation training (moderate‐certainty). ￭ When people engage with motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills, they may not be more likely to report a reduction/abstinence from drug use when compared to a waiting list control (low‐certainty). ￭ We are uncertain whether people engaged in motivational interviewing/mindfulness and cognitive skills are not more likely to report a reduction in marijuana use, a positive drug test, or to be re‐arrested when compared to treatment as usual (very low‐certainty). ￭ When families and juveniles engage in multi‐systemic therapy, they may be more likely to report a reduction in drug dependence or to be re‐arrested in comparison to treatment as usual or group substance abuse therapy (low‐certainty). ￭ We are uncertain whether people involved in interpersonal psychotherapy are not more likely to use drugs again in comparison to a psychoeducational intervention (very low‐certainty). ￭ We are uncertain whether people involved in legal defence service and wrap‐around services are not more likely to commit new offences in comparison to a legal defence service only (very low‐certainty).

These have become the accepted first‐line treatments for the disorder. Despite the established evidence‐base for these therapies, they are not always widely available or accessible. Many barriers limit treatment uptake, such as the limited number of qualified therapists to deliver the interventions, cost, and compliance issues, such as time off work, childcare, and transportation, associated with the need to attend weekly appointments. Delivering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the Internet is an effective and acceptable alternative to therapist‐delivered treatments for anxiety and depression. However, fewer Internet‐based therapies have been developed and evaluated for PTSD, and uncertainty surrounds the efficacy of Internet‐based cognitive and behavioural therapy (I‐C/BT) for PTSD. Objectives To assess the effects of I‐C/BT for PTSD in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Groups Specialised Register (CCMDCTR) to June 2016 and identified four studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The CCMDCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) from MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched online clinical trial registries and reference lists of included studies, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional and ongoing studies. We ran an update search on 1 March 2018, and identified four additional completed studies, which we added to the analyses along with two that were previously awaiting classification. Selection criteria We searched for RCTs of I‐C/BT compared to face‐to‐face or Internet‐based psychological treatment, psychoeducation, wait list or care as usual. We included studies of adults (aged over 16 years or over), in which at least 70% of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Data collection and analysis We entered data into Review Manager 5 software. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data with a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, except where heterogeneity was present, in which case we used a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias; any conflicts were discussed with a third author, with the aim of reaching a unanimous decision. Main results We included 10 studies with 720 participants in the review. Eight of the studies compared I‐C/BT delivered with therapist guidance to a wait list control. Two studies compared guided I‐C/BT with I‐non‐C/BT. There was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. Very low‐quality evidence showed that, compared with wait list, I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in PTSD post‐treatment (SMD –0.60, 95% CI –0.97 to –0.24; studies = 8, participants = 560). However, there was no evidence of a difference in PTSD symptoms when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD –0.43, 95% CI –1.41 to 0.56; studies = 3, participants = 146). There may be little or no difference in dropout rates between the I‐C/BT and wait list groups (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.88; studies = 8, participants = 585; low‐quality evidence). I‐C/BT was no more effective than wait list at reducing the risk of a diagnosis of PTSD after treatment (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.00; studies = 1, participants = 62; very low‐quality evidence). I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in symptoms of depression both post‐treatment (SMD –0.61, 95% CI –1.17 to –0.05; studies = 5, participants = 425; very low‐quality evidence). Very low‐quality evidence also suggested that I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in symptoms of anxiety post‐treatment (SMD –0.67, 95% CI –0.98 to –0.36; studies = 4, participants = 305), and at follow‐up less than six months (MD –12.59, 95% CI –20.74 to –4.44; studies = 1, participants = 42; very low‐quality evidence). The effects of I‐C/BT on quality of life were uncertain (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12; studies = 2, participants = 221; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found no difference in PTSD symptoms between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups when measured post‐treatment (SMD –0.08, 95% CI –0.52 to 0.35; studies = 2, participants = 82; very low‐quality evidence), or when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI –0.41 to 0.57; studies = 2, participants = 65; very low‐quality evidence). However, those who received I‐C/BT reported their PTSD symptoms were better at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD –8.83, 95% CI –17.32 to –0.34; studies = 1, participants = 18; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found no difference in depressive symptoms between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups when measured post‐treatment (SMD –0.12, 95% CI –0.78 to 0.54; studies = 2, participants = 84; very low‐quality evidence) or when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD 0.20, 95% CI –0.31 to 0.71; studies = 2, participants = 61; very low‐quality evidence). However, those who received I‐C/BT reported their depressive symptoms were better at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD –8.34, 95% CI –15.83 to –0.85; studies = 1, participants = 18; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found no difference in symptoms of anxiety between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups when measured post‐treatment (SMD 0.08, 95% CI –0.78 to 0.95; studies = 2, participants = 74; very low‐quality evidence) or when follow‐up was less than six months (SMD –0.16, 95% CI –0.67 to 0.35; studies = 2, participants = 60; very low‐quality evidence).

None of the included studies reported on cost‐effectiveness or adverse events. Authors conclusions While the review found some beneficial effects of I‐C/BT for PTSD, the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of included trials.

However, long‐term antipsychotic exposure has been associated with a range of adverse effects, including extra‐pyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia and death. Intermittent drug techniques refers to the use of medication only during periods of incipient relapse or symptom exacerbation rather than continuously. The aim is to reduce the risk of typical adverse effects of antipsychotics by reducing long‐term medication exposure for patients who are receiving maintenance treatment while limiting the risk of relapse, with a further goal of improving social functioning resulting from the reduction of antipsychotic‐induced side effects Objectives To review the effects of different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2012) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching relevant intermittent drug treatment articles and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance therapy for people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were relapse and hospitalisation. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. For non‐skewed continuous endpoint data extracted from valid scales, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups with a 95% CI. Where data displayed heterogeneity, these were analysed using a random‐effects model. Skewed data are presented in tables. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results Of 241 records retrieved by the search, 17 trials conducted between 1961 and 2011, involving 2252 participants with follow‐up from six weeks to two years, were included. Homogenous data demonstrated that instances of relapse were significantly higher in people receiving any intermittent drug treatment in the long term (n = 436, 7 RCTs, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.54,  moderate quality evidence ). Intermittent treatment was shown to be more effective than placebo, however, and demonstrated that significantly less people receiving intermittent antipsychotics experienced full relapse by medium term (n = 290, 2 RCTs, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58,  very low quality evidence ). Hospitalisation rates were higher for people receiving any intermittent drug treatment by long term (n = 626, 5 RCTs, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.06,  moderate quality evidence ). Results demonstrated little difference in instances of tardive dyskinesia in groups with any intermittent drug technique versus maintenance therapy, with equivocal results (displaying slight heterogeneity) at long term (n = 165, 4 RCTs, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.30,  low quality evidence ). Authors conclusions Results of this review support the existing evidence that intermittent antipsychotic treatment is not as effective as continuous, maintained antipsychotic therapy in preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment regarding adverse effects typically associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment, as well as any cost‐effectiveness of this experimental treatment. Plain language summary Intermittent drug techniques for schizophrenia Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment for schizophrenia and helps people cope with positive symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, long‐term exposure to these drugs has been associated with serious side effects, such as"""

Intensive Case Management evolved from two original community models of care, Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Case Management (CM), where ICM emphasises the importance of small caseload (fewer than 20) and high‐intensity input. Objectives To assess the effects of ICM as a means of caring for severely mentally ill people in the community in comparison with non‐ICM (caseload greater than 20) and with standard community care. We did not distinguish between models of ICM. In addition, to assess whether the effect of ICM on hospitalisation (mean number of days per month in hospital) is influenced by the interventions fidelity to the ACT model and by the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted (baseline level of hospital use). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (last update search 10 April 2015). Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, aged 18 to 65 years and treated in the community care setting, where ICM is compared to non‐ICM or standard care. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We performed a random‐effects meta‐regression analysis to examine the association of the interventions fidelity to the ACT model and the rate of hospital use in the setting where the trial was conducted with the treatment effect. We assessed overall quality for clinically important outcomes using the GRADE approach and investigated possible risk of bias within included trials. Main results The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies.

Information and communication technology (ICT) is increasingly being used to deliver information, treatment or both for people with severe mental disorders. Objectives To evaluate the effects of psychoeducational interventions using ICT as a means of educating and supporting people with schizophrenia or related psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (2008, 2009 and September 2010), inspected references of identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICT as a psychoeducational and supportive tool with any other type of psychoeducation and supportive intervention or standard care. Data collection and analysis We selected trials and extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias using the criteria described in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Main results We included six trials with a total of 1063 participants. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes (patient compliance and global state) between psychoeducational interventions using ICT and standard care. Technology‐mediated psychoeducation improved mental state in the short term (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.00; n = 30, 1 RCT, MD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.90 to ‐0.12) but not global state (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.42). Knowledge and insight were not effected (n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.15; n = 84, 1 RCT, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.03). People allocated to technology‐mediated psychoeducation perceived that they received more social support than people allocated to the standard care group (n = 30, 1 RCT, MD 0.42, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.80). When technology‐mediated psychoeducation was used as an adjunct to standard care it did not improve general compliance in the short term (n = 291, 3 RCTs, RR for leaving the study early 0.81, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.19) or in the long term (n = 434, 2 RCTs, RR for leaving the study early 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.25). However, it did improve compliance with medication in the long term (n = 71, 1 RCT, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Adding technology‐mediated psychoeducation on top of standard care did not clearly improve either general mental state, negative or positive symptoms, global state, level of knowledge or quality of life. However, the results were not consistent regarding level of knowledge and satisfaction with treatment. When technology‐mediated psychoeducation plus standard care was compared with patient education not using technology the only outcome reported was satisfaction with treatment. There were no differences between groups. Authors conclusions Using ICT to deliver psychoeducational interventions has no clear effects compared with standard care, other methods of delivering psychoeducation and support, or both. Researchers used a variety of methods of delivery and outcomes, and studies were few and underpowered. ICT remains a promising method of delivering psychoeducation; the equivocal findings of this review should not postpone high‐quality research in this area. Plain language summary Patient education and support for people with schizophrenia by using information and communication technology Information and Communication Technology (ICT) includes the use of computers, telephones, television and radio, video and audio recordings. It consists of all technical means used to handle information and communication. During the last twenty years there has been a growing trend towards the use of ICT for the delivery of education, treatment and social support for people with mental illness.  Education about illness and treatment has been found to be a good way to increase a persons awareness of their health. ICT has the potential to improve many aspects of overall care, including"""

Prompts such as telephone calls, visits, and a posted referral letter to patients are currently used to encourage patient attendance at clinics and/or compliance with medication. More recently, the use of information and communication technology (ICT)‐based prompting methods have increased. Methods include mobile text message (SMS ‐ short message service), e‐mail or use of any other electronic device with the stated purpose of encouraging compliance. Objectives To investigate the effects of ICT‐based prompting to support treatment compliance in people with serious mental illness compared with standard care.

Main results The search identified 35 references, with 25 studies, but we could only include two studies with a total of 358 participants. The studies had a moderate risk of bias, and therefore risk overestimating any positive effects of ICT‐based prompting. Both included studies compared semi‐automatised ICT‐based prompting intervention with standard care groups in mental health outpatient care. The interventions were SMS‐message and an electronic assistant device. One included study reported our primary outcome, compliance. There was not any clear evidence that ICT‐based prompts increase improvement in compliance (stop taking medication within six months n = 320, RR 1.11 CI 0.96 to 1.29,  moderate quality evidence ).

Research on the effects of psychotherapy for schizophrenia has shown mixed results. Although pharmacological interventions remain the treatment of choice, the effects of treatments focusing on psychosocial factors affecting schizophrenia are important. Objectives To review the effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, or both, for people with schizophrenia or severe mental illness. Search methods For the updated review, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2008) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria We sought all randomised trials of individual psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis for people with schizophrenia or severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a fixed‐effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and weighted mean differences (WMD) using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We included four randomised trials (total 528 participants, 5 comparisons). All used a psychodynamic approach and reported limited data. For individual psychodynamic therapy versus medication alone we found significantly more participants in the therapy group were unable to be discharged (n=92, RR 8.35 CI 2.0 to 34.3, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6). We found no significant difference between groups in the number of participants who were re‐hospitalised (n=24, RR 0.63 CI 0.3 to 1.4) during long‐term analyses. At 12 months, fewer participants in the psychotherapy groups needed additional medications compared with those who did receive medication (n=74, RR 0.64 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 3 to 6), and also at three years follow up (n=87, RR 0.85 CI 0.8 to 1.0, NNT 7 CI 5 to 26). For individual psychodynamic therapy plus medication versus medication alone we found no significant difference in suicide (n=92, RR 0.16 CI 0.01 to 2.9) or suitability for discharge (n=92, RR 1.09 CI 0.2 to 7.4). Also, we found re‐hospitalisation rates in long‐term analyses were equivocal (n=24, RR 1.00 CI 0.4 to 2.6). For insight‐orientated psychodynamic psychotherapy versus reality adaptive psychotherapy we found no significant difference in re‐hospitalisation rates (n=164, RR 1.20 CI 0.9 to 1.6), but we found study attrition favoured the insight‐orientated psychodynamic psychotherapy group at 12 months (n=164, RR 0.46 CI 0.3 to 0.6, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). For individual psychodynamic psychotherapy versus group psychotherapy we found no significant difference in global state not improved (n=100, RR 1.27 CI 1.0 to 1.7). For individual psychodynamic therapy plus medication versus individual psychodynamic therapy we found rates of re‐hospitalisation during long‐term analyses were equivocal (n=24, RR 1.00 CI 0.4 to 2.6). There is no clear evidence of any positive effect of psychodynamic therapy and the possibility of adverse effects seems never to have been considered. We did not identify any trials using a psychoanalytic approach. Authors conclusions Current data do not support the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy techniques for hospitalised people with schizophrenia. If psychoanalytic therapy is being used for people with schizophrenia there is an urgent need for trials. Plain language summary Individual psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis for schizophrenia and severe mental illness Psychodynamic treatment is an intervention that can be classed as one of the talking therapies. The relationship between the person seeking therapy and the therapist form the main component of the therapy. Its use for people with schizophrenia as a sole treatment, without medication, has not been evaluated very well, apart from four studies in the early 1970s and 1980s. It is clear from the limited studies available that medication is an important part of any treatment for people with psychotic illnesses and should be used in conjunction with any talking treatments."""

We also examine the adverse effects associated with such a procedure. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (10 June 2014, 6 October 2015, and 30 March 2017). We examined references of all included studies for further trials. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting useable data, comparing increasing the antipsychotic dose rather than maintaining the original dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data . We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create a Summary of findings table. Main results Ten relevant RCTs with 675 participants are included in this review. All trials were double blind except one single blind. All studies had a run‐in phase to confirm they did not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. The trials were published between 1980 and 2016. In most studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. In addition sample sizes were often small, limiting the overall quality of the evidence. Overall, no clear difference was found between groups in terms of the number of participants who showed clinically relevant response (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.40, 9 RCTs, N = 533,  low‐quality evidence ), or left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.07,  very low quality evidence ), or due to any reason (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90, 5 RCTs, N = 353,  low‐quality evidence ). Similarly, no clear difference was found in general mental state as measured by PANSS total score change (MD −1.44, 95% CI −6.85 to 3.97, 3 RCTs, N = 258,  very low quality evidence ). At least one adverse effect was equivocal between groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.50, 2 RCTs, N = 191,  very low quality evidence ). Data were not reported for time in hospital or quality‐of‐life outcomes. Finally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not show any effect on the primary outcome but these analyses were clearly underpowered. Authors conclusions Current data do not show any clear differences between increasing or maintaining the antipsychotic dose for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to their initial antipsychotic treatment. Adverse effect reporting was limited and poor. There is an urgent need for further trials in order to determine the optional treatment strategy in such cases. Plain language summary Increasing versus maintaining the dose of antipsychotic medication for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to treatment Review question If a person with schizophrenia does not initially respond to an antipsychotic medication, is increasing the dose of this antipsychotic effective and safe? Background Many people with the serious mental illness schizophrenia do not respond fully (i.e. symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations still remain) with a standard dose of an initially prescribed antipsychotic drug. In such cases, clinicians can consider increasing the antipsychotic dose beyond regular thresholds or switching to a different antipsychotic drug in order to enhance antipsychotic efficacy. The evidence surrounding the optimal treatment strategy is scarce. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia ran an electronic search of their specialised register up to 30 March 2017 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia who were not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment to receive either an increased antipsychotic dose or continue on the same dose. The search returned 1919 records, which were checked for eligibility by the review authors. Evidence found Ten trials met the review requirements and provided usable data. No clear difference between increasing the dose of the antipsychotic drug and continuing antipsychotic treatment at the same dose was shown for any efficacy (clinical response) or safety (incidence of adverse effects) outcomes. The evidence currently available is limited and of low or very low quality. In particular, very few studies reported adverse effects adequately. Conclusions The results of the present review show that there is no good‐quality evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that increasing the antipsychotic dose for patients not responding to their initial antipsychotic treatment differs from continuing antipsychotic treatment at the same dose. No clear evidence regarding safety is available. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be made. Larger, well‐designed trials are needed."""

To fill this gap, treatment guidelines, based on explicit assessments of the evidence base, are commonly used in several fields of psychiatry, including schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. However, it remains unclear whether treatment guidelines have any material impact on provider performance and patient outcomes, and how implementation should be conducted to maximise benefit. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of guideline implementation strategies in improving process outcomes (performance of healthcare providers) and patient outcomes. We also explored which components of different guideline implementation strategies could influence them. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (March 2012 and August 2015), as well as references of included studies. Selection criteria Studies that examined schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders to compare guideline implementation strategies with usual care or to assess the comparative efficacy of different guideline implementation strategies. Data collection and analysis Review authors worked independently and in duplicate to critically appraise records from 990 studies; six individual studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the six included studies, significant heterogeneity was found in the focus of the guideline, target of the intervention, implementation strategy, and outcome measures, so meta‐analysis was carried out for antipsychotic co‐prescribing only. Main results This review now includes six studies, with a total of 1727 participants. Of the six included studies, practitioner impact was assessed in four. Overall, risk of bias was rated as low or unclear, and all evidence in the Summary of findings tables was graded as low or very low quality .  Meta‐analysis revealed that a combination of several guideline dissemination and implementation strategies targeting healthcare professionals did not reduce antipsychotic co‐prescribing in schizophrenia outpatients (2 RCTs, N = 1082, RR 1.10 CI 0.99 to 1.23; corrected for cluster design"""

Since the early 1980s there have been over a dozen more clinical trials, yet hydergines efficacy remains uncertain. Although previous reviews offer generally favourable support for hydergines efficacy, they were, however, limited by a bias with respect to the particular clinical studies chosen (e.g., the inclusion of case reports, and uncontrolled trials), and by authors impressionistic assessments of results. Not surprisingly, there has been a lack of consensus among reviewers with regard to the efficacy of hydergine. In 1994, a meta‐analysis was published by the present reviewers who reported that overall, hydergine was more effective than placebo. However they also observed that the statistical evidence for efficacy in possible or probable Alzheimers disease patients was so modest that one additional statistically non‐significant trial would have reduced the results to non‐significance. Objectives Because of uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of hydergine, the goals of this overview were to assess its overall effect in patients with possible dementia, and to investigate potential moderators of an effect.

It can be used for therapy or rehabilitation programs for cognitive, physical, social, emotional, and recreational benefits, thus improving the persons body, mind and spirit. Between 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication, and may also develop undesirable adverse effects, horticultural therapy may be of value for these people. Objectives To evaluate the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared with standard care or other additional psychosocial interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (Janurary 2013) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, and manually searching reference lists. Selection criteria We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing horticultural therapy plus standard care with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) and for binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias and created a Summary of findings table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results We included one single blind study (total n = 24). The overall risk of bias in the study was considered to be unclear although the randomisation was adequate. It compared a package of horticultural therapy which consisted of one hour per day of horticultural activity plus standard care with standard care alone over two weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. Only two people were lost to follow‐up in the study, both in the horticultural therapy group (1 RCT n = 24,RR 5.00 95% CI 0.27 to 94.34,  very low quality evidence ). There was no clear evidence of a difference in Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI‐C) change scores between groups, however confidence intervals were wide (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐0.90 95% CI ‐10.35 to 8.55,  very low quality evidence ). At the end of treatment, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) change scores in horticultural therapy group were greater than that in the control group (1 RCT n = 22, MD ‐23.70 CI ‐35.37 to ‐ 12.03, very low quality evidence). The only included study did not report on adverse effects of interventions. Authors conclusions Based on the current very low quality data, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. This therapy remains unproven and more and larger randomised trials are needed to increase high quality evidence in this area. Plain language summary Gardening activity as a therapy for schizophrenia Horticultural therapy is based on the therapeutic value of participating in garden activities such as growing fruit or vegetables and/or flowers. Gardening is thought to improve peoples well‐being through being a recreational and sociable activity which may lead to improvements in peoples thinking, new friendships and more positive emotions. The benefits of gardening can also apply to people with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. Gardening reduces stress, which is important because stress can often lead to mental illness. Gardening is also hard work and a physical activity, and so motivates people with mental illness who often feel tired and apathetic. Weight gain is common for people with mental illness and gardening is good physical exercise. Since 5% to 15% of people with schizophrenia experience symptoms in spite of taking antipsychotic drugs and also because these drugs have debilitating side effects, horticultural therapy may be of value to these people. This review focuses on the effects of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. An electronic search for relevant randomised trials was run in January 2013. Only one trial was included, it randomised a total of 24 people with schizophrenia to received either their standard care plus horticultural therapy or standard care only. The trial only lasted 2 weeks (10 consecutive days) with no long‐term follow‐up. There are few results and the quality of evidence was rated by the review authors to be  very low quality.  Some of the information from this one study favoured horticultural therapy but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on benefits or harms of horticultural therapy for people with schizophrenia. More large, better conducted and reported trials are required to determine the effectiveness and benefits of horticultural therapy.

Objectives To investigate the effects of ERT (estrogens only) or HRT (estrogens combined with a progestagen) compared with placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cognitive function of postmenopausal women with dementia. Search methods The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, which contains records from many medical databases,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS were searched on 7 November 2007 using the terms ORT, PORT, ERT, HRT, estrogen*, oestrogen* and progesterone*. Selection criteria All double‐blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into the effect of ERT or HRT for cognitive function with a treatment period of at least two weeks in postmenopausal women with AD or other types of dementia. Data collection and analysis Abstracts of the references retrieved by the searches were read by two reviewers (EH and KY) independently in order to discard those that were clearly not eligible for inclusion. The two reviewers studied the full text of the remaining references and independently selected studies for inclusion. Any disparity in the ensuing lists was resolved by discussion with all reviewers in order to arrive at the final list of included studies. The selection criteria ensured that the blinding and randomization of the included studies was adequate. The two reviewers also assessed the quality of other aspects of the included trials. One reviewer (EH) extracted the data from the studies, but was aided and checked by JB from Cochrane. Main results A total of seven trials including 351 women with AD were analysed. Because different drugs were used at different studies it was not possible to combine more than two studies in any analysis. On a clinical global rating, clinicians scored patients taking CEE as significantly worse compared with the placebo group on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale after 12 months (overall WMD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.69, z = 1.99, P < 0.05). Patients taking CEE had a worse performance on the delayed recall of the Paragraph Test (overall WMD = ‐0.45, 95% CI = ‐0.79 to ‐0.11, z = 2.60, P < 0.01) after one month than those taking placebo. They had a worse performance on Finger Tapping after 12 months (WMD = ‐3.90, 95% CI = ‐7.85 to 0.05, z = 1.93, P < 0.05). Limited positive effects were found for the lower dosage of CEE (0.625 mg/day) which showed a significant improvement in MMSE score only when assessed at two months, and disappeared after correction for multiple testing. No significant effects for MMSE were found at longer end points (3, 6 and 12 months of treatment). With a dosage of 1.25 mg/d CEE, short‐term significant effects were found for Trial‐Making test B at one month and Digit Span backward at four months. After two months of transdermal diestradiol (E2) treatment, a highly significant effect was observed for the word recall test (WMD = 6.50, 95% CI = 4.04 to 8.96, z = 5.19, P < 0.0001). No other significant effects were found for other outcomes measured. Authors conclusions Currently, HRT or ERT for cognitive improvement or maintenance is not indicated for women with AD. Plain language summary There is no evidence of a positive effect that estrogen replacement therapy can maintain cognitive function for a longer period of time (> five months) in women with Alzheimers disease After the menopause, in women levels of estrogens decline. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or replacement therapy with both estrogens and progestagens (hormone replacement therapy or HRT) might theoretically help to maintain cognitive function in postmenopausal women with dementia. We therefore investigated the results of randomized controlled trials of the effects of ERT and HRT on cognitive function in postmenopausal women with AD. Overall, however, there was no evidence for positive effects of ERT or HRT which was sustained after two months of treatment. This is similar to results of studies of ERT and HRT in women without dementia, which additionally found that HRT increases the rate of dementia in women over 65 years."""

A meta‐analysis of population based studies in Europe found the prevalence of dementia in individuals over 65 to be 6.4%. Homeopathy (also spelt ""homoeopathy"") is a popular form of ""complementary"" or ""alternative"" treatment. Some studies have found evidence for efficacy of homeopathic treatment for some conditions, but any mechanism of action of the ultra molecular dilutions used in homeopathy is not comprehensible in terms of current scientific concepts. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety profile of homeopathically prepared medications used in treating dementia, as established by randomized controlled trials. Search methods The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 9 March 2009 using the terms alum*, homeop*, ""nat sulph"" and ""natrum sulphate"". In addition the reviewers searched CISCOM, AMED and Hom‐Inform. Leading homeopathic researchers, practitioners and manufacturers were also contacted. Selection criteria All types of randomized controlled trials with a sample size of more than 20 were considered. Data collection and analysis The database searches resulted in one trial being identified. After examining the abstract, a paper copy was obtained and independently assessed for inclusion by RM and JW. Main results There were no studies that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion and no data to present. Authors\ conclusions In view of the absence of evidence it is not possible to comment on the use of homeopathy in treating dementia. The extent of homeopathic prescribing for people with dementia is not clear and so it is difficult to comment on the importance of conducting trials in this area. Plain language summary No evidence that homeopathy is effective in treating dementia Dementia is a distressing illness that has major implications for individuals with the disease and their carers. Homeopathy is a popular type of complementary medicine. It is however controversial because although there is some evidence that it is not just a placebo, no one understands how it could work. The researchers did not find any good quality trials and so cannot say whether it is or is not effective for treating this condition. As no information is available on how much homeopathy is used for dementia, it is difficult to say whether it is important to conduct more trials."

Despite this elevated prevalence, UK national strategies around sexual health and HIV prevention do not state that people with serious mental illness are a high risk group. However, a significant proportion in this group are sexually active and engage in HIV‐risk behaviours including having multiple sexual partners, infrequent use of condoms and trading sex for money or drugs. Therefore we propose the provision of HIV prevention advice could enhance the physical and social well being of this population. Objectives To assess the effects of HIV prevention advice in reducing morbidity, mortality and preserving the quality of life in people with serious mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (24 January 2012; 4 July 2016). Selection criteria We planned to include all randomised controlled trials focusing on HIV prevention advice versus standard care or comparing HIV prevention advice with other more focused methods of delivering care or information for people with serious mental illness. Data collection and analysis Review authors (NW, AC, AA, GT) independently screened search results and did not identify any studies that fulfilled the review’s criteria. Main results We did not identify any randomised studies that evaluated advice regarding HIV for people with serious mental illness. The excluded studies illustrate that randomisation of packages of care relevant to both people with serious mental illness and HIV risk are possible. Authors conclusions Policy makers, clinicians, researchers and service users need to collaborate to produce guidance on how best to provide advice for people with serious mental illness in preventing the spread of HIV infection. It is entirely feasible that this could be within the context of a well‐designed simple large randomised study. Plain language summary HIV prevention advice for people with serious mental illness The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a condition in humans in which our immune systems steadily begins to fail and allows life‐threatening infections and cancers. People with mental illness have higher than usual rates of HIV than in the general population. Despite this, UK national strategies around sexual health and HIV prevention do not state that people with serious mental illness are a high risk group. A significant number of people with mental health problems are sexually active and engage in HIV‐risk behaviours such as having multiple sexual partners, not using condoms and trading sex for money or drugs. In addition, during relapse, mental illness may lead people to engage in practices they would not usually be engaged in. The provision of HIV prevention advice could enhance the physical and social well being of people with mental health problems. HIV health advice can take many forms. Advice is the active provision of information. It has an education component and is delivered in a gentle and non‐patronising manner. Advice from a healthcare professional can have a positive impact on behaviour and may motivate people to seek further support and treatment. The reviews aim was to assess the potential beneficial or harmful effects of HIV prevention advice in people with serious mental illness (SMI). A search for randomised trials comparing HIV prevention advice with standard care for people with SMI was run in January 2012 and July 2016. However, no studies or trials were found. Policy makers, health professionals, researchers and people with mental health problems need to collaborate to produce evidence‐based guidance on how best to provide advice for people with serious mental illness in preventing the spread of HIV. Better guidance and information about HIV in people with mental illness could be found by conducting well‐designed, simple and large studies on this important topic.

Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often clinically perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds, and they also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Objectives To review the effects in clinical response of haloperidol and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing haloperidol with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 17 randomised trials and 877 participants. The size of the included studies was between 16 and 109 participants. All studies were short‐term with a study length between two and 12 weeks. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported. We found no clear evidence that haloperidol was superior to low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of clinical response (haloperidol 40%, low‐potency drug 36%, 14 RCTs, n = 574, RR 1.11, CI 0.86 to 1.44 low quality evidence ). There was also no clear evidence of benefit for either group in acceptability of treatment with equivocal difference in the number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (haloperidol 13%, low‐potency antipsychotics 17%, 11 RCTs, n = 408, RR 0.82, CI 0.38 to 1.77,  low quality evidence ). Similar equivocal results were found between groups for experiencing at least one adverse effect (haloperidol 70%, low‐potency antipsychotics 35%, 5 RCTs n = 158, RR 1.97, CI 0.69 to 5.66,  very low quality evidence  ). More participants from the low‐potency drug group experienced sedation (haloperidol 14%, low‐potency antipsychotics 41%, 2 RCTs, n = 44, RR 0.30, CI 0.11 to 0.82,  moderate quality evidence ), orthostasis problems (haloperidol 25%, low‐potency antipsychotics 71%, 1 RCT, n = 41, RR 0.35, CI 0.16 to 0.78) and weight gain (haloperidol 5%, low‐potency antipsychotics 29%, 3 RCTs, n = 88, RR 0.22, CI 0.06 to 0.81). In contrast, the outcome at least one movement disorder was more frequent in the haloperidol group (haloperidol 72%, low‐potency antipsychotics 41%, 5 RCTs, n = 170, RR 1.64, CI 1.22 to 2.21,  low quality evidence ). No data were available for death or quality of life. The results of the primary outcome were robust in several subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Authors conclusions The results do not clearly show a superiority in efficacy of haloperidol compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. Differences in adverse events were found for movement disorders, which were more frequent in the haloperidol group, and orthostatic problems, sedation and weight gain, which were more frequent in the low‐potency antipsychotic group. The quality of studies was low, and the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interest varied from moderate to very low, so more newer studies would be needed in order to draw a definite conclusion about whether or not haloperidol is superior or inferior to low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Haloperidol versus first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia Drugs called antipsychotics are the main treatment for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness where sufferers experience both positive symptoms of delusions and hallucinations and negative symptoms such as apathy, lack of drive, disorganisation of behaviour and thought. This review examined whether a high‐potency antipsychotic, haloperidol is more effective than low‐potency antipsychotics. The classification into high‐potency and low‐potency medication means that for low‐potency antipsychotic drugs, higher doses are necessary to obtain the same effect and response in patients. Haloperidol is the most frequently used antipsychotic drug in many countries and, along with other high‐potency antipsychotics is often considered more effective than low‐potency antipsychotics. Typical examples of low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine or levomepromazine. High‐ and low‐potency antipsychotics also seem to differ in their side‐effects. Low‐potency drugs cause sedation and poor muscle strength, whereas high‐potency drugs produce side‐effects such as movement disorders (the inability to sit still, uncontrollable shaking and difficulty in walking). The review is based on results of a search run in 2010 and includes 17 studies with a total of 877 participants comparing haloperidol with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs.The results do not clearly show a superiority of haloperidol compared with low‐potency antipsychotics. However, more participants from the low‐potency drug group experienced weight gain and sedation. The experience of at least one movement disorder was significantly higher with haloperidol. The number as well as the quality of studies is low, for the main outcomes of interest the authors rated quality of evidence for as moderate quality for two of them, two as low quality and one as very low quality. So the evidence is not strong and more newer studies would be needed in order to draw a conclusion about whether or not haloperidol is superior to low‐potency antipsychotics. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that there is moderate quality evidence that haloperidol and low‐potency antipsychotics are approximately equal in their effectiveness, but there is lower quality evidence that they clearly differ in side‐effects (such as weight gain and movement disorders).

Previous narrative, unsystematic reviews found no differences in terms of efficacy between the various first‐generation (“conventional”, ""typical"") antipsychotic agents. This established the unproven psychopharmacological assumption of a comparable efficacy between the first‐generation antipsychotic compounds codified in textbooks and treatment guidelines. Because this assumption contrasts with the clinical impression, a high‐quality systematic review appeared highly necessary. Objectives To compare the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of haloperidol with other first‐generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods In October 2011 and July 2012, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. To identify further relevant publications, we screened the references of all included studies and contacted the manufacturers of haloperidol for further relevant trials and missing information on identified studies. Furthermore, we contacted the corresponding authors of all included trials for missing data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral haloperidol with another oral first‐generation antipsychotic drug (with the exception of the low‐potency antipsychotics chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, levopromazine, mesoridazine, perazine, prochlorpromazine, and thioridazine) in schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Clinically important response to treatment was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were global state, mental state, behaviour, overall acceptability (measured by the number of participants leaving the study early due to any reason), overall efficacy (attrition due to inefficacy of treatment), overall tolerability (attrition due to adverse events), and specific adverse effects. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration`s \Risk of bias\ tool. We analysed dichotomous outcomes with risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes with mean differences (MD), both with the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). All analyses were based on a random‐effects model and we preferably used data on an intention‐to‐treat basis where possible. Main results The systematic review currently includes 63 randomised trials with 3675 participants. Bromperidol (n = 9), loxapine (n = 7), and trifluoperazine (n = 6) were the most frequently administered antipsychotics comparator to haloperidol.

It is widely accessible and may be the only antipsychotic medication available in limited‐resource areas. Objectives To examine whether haloperidol alone is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation, wherein clinicians are required to intervene to prevent harm to self and others. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (26th May 2016). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people exhibiting aggression and/or agitation thought to be due to psychosis, allocated rapid use of haloperidol alone (by any route), compared with any other treatment. Outcomes of interest included tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes, repeated need for rapid tranquillisation within 24 hours, specific behaviours (threat or injury to others/self), adverse effects. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and providing useable data. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR), for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), and for cognitive outcomes we derived standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and using a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce Summary of findings tables which included our pre‐specified main outcomes of interest. Main results We found nine new RCTs from the 2016 update search, giving a total of 41 included studies and 24 comparisons. Few studies were undertaken in circumstances that reflect real‐world practice, and, with notable exceptions, most were small and carried considerable risk of bias. Due to the large number of comparisons, we can only present a summary of main results. Compared with placebo, more people in the haloperidol group were asleep at two hours (2 RCTs, n=220, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.82 to 0.95, very low‐quality evidence) and experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n=207, RR 7.49, 95%CI 0.93 to 60.21, very low‐quality evidence). Compared with aripiprazole, people in the haloperidol group required fewer injections than those in the aripiprazole group (2 RCTs, n=473, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.62 to 0.99, low‐quality evidence). More people in the haloperidol group experienced dystonia (2 RCTs, n=477, RR 6.63, 95%CI 1.52 to 28.86, very low‐quality evidence). Four trials (n=207) compared haloperidol with lorazepam with no significant differences with regard to number of participants asleep at one hour (1 RCT, n=60, RR 1.05, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.44, very low‐quality of evidence) or those requiring additional injections (1 RCT, n=66, RR 1.14, 95%CI 0.91 to 1.43, very low‐quality of evidence). Haloperidols adverse effects were not offset by addition of lorazepam (e.g. dystonia 1 RCT, n=67, RR 8.25, 95%CI 0.46 to 147.45, very low‐quality of evidence). Addition of promethazine was investigated in two trials (n=376). More people in the haloperidol group were not tranquil or asleep by 20 minutes (1 RCT, n=316, RR 1.60, 95%CI 1.18 to 2.16, moderate‐quality evidence). Acute dystonia was too common in the haloperidol alone group for the trial to continue beyond the interim analysis (1 RCT, n=316, RR 19.48, 95%CI 1.14 to 331.92, low‐quality evidence). Authors conclusions Additional data from new studies does not alter previous conclusions of this review. If no other alternative exists, sole use of intramuscular haloperidol could be life‐saving. Where additional drugs are available, sole use of haloperidol for extreme emergency could be considered unethical. Addition of the sedating promethazine has support from better‐grade evidence from within randomised trials. Use of an alternative antipsychotic drug is only partially supported by fragmented and poor‐grade evidence. Adding a benzodiazepine to haloperidol does not have strong evidence of benefit and carries risk of additional harm. After six decades of use for emergency rapid tranquillisation, this is still an area in need of good independent trials relevant to real‐world practice. Plain language summary Haloperidol as a means of calming people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis Aim of review This review looks at whether haloperidol is effective for treating people who are agitated and aggressive as a result of having psychosis. Background People with psychosis may experience hearing voices (hallucinations) or abnormal thoughts (delusions), which can make the person frightened, distressed and agitated (restless, excitable or irritable), leading sometimes to aggressive behaviour. This poses a significant challenge for mental health professionals, who have to quickly choose the best available treatment to prevent the risk of harm to both patient and/or others. Haloperidol is a medication used for treating people with psychosis that can be taken by mouth or injected. As well as being an antipsychotic (preventing psychosis), it also calms people down or helps them to sleep. Searches In 2011 and 2016, the information specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialised register for randomised trials that looked at the effects of giving haloperidol compared with either placebo or other treatments to people who are aggressive or agitated because they were experiencing psychosis. Results Forty‐one studies are now included in the review but information in these is of low‐quality. Main results show that when compared with placebo or no treatment, more people having haloperidol were asleep after two hours. However, evidence is not strong. Results are made more complex by large variety of available treatments (24 comparisons). Conclusions The review authors conclude there is weak evidence that haloperidol calms people down and helps manage difficult situations. However, this is not based on good‐quality trails and therefore health professionals and people with mental health problems are left without clear evidence‐based guidance. In some situations, haloperidol may be the only choice, but this is far from ideal because although haloperidol is effective at calming people down it has side effects (e.g. restlessness, shaking of the head, hands and body, heart problems). These side effects can be just as distressing as psychosis and may act as a barrier that stops people coming back for future treatment. More research is needed to help people consider and understand which medication is better at calming people down; has fewer side effects; works quickly and rapidly; and can be used at lower dosages (or less frequent injections).

Characterised by restlessness, excitability and irritability, this can result in verbal and physically aggressive behaviour ‐ and both can be prolonged. Aggression within the psychiatric setting imposes a significant challenge to clinicians and risk to service users; it is a frequent cause for admission to inpatient facilities. If people continue to be aggressive it can lengthen hospitalisation. Haloperidol is used to treat people with long‐term aggression. Objectives To examine whether haloperidol alone, administered orally, intramuscularly or intravenously, is an effective treatment for long‐term/persistent aggression in psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2011 and April 2015). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or double blind trials (implying randomisation) with useable data comparing haloperidol with another drug or placebo for people with psychosis and long‐term/persistent aggression. Data collection and analysis One review author (AK) extracted data. For dichotomous data, one review author (AK) calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed‐effect model. One review author (AK) assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results We have no good‐quality evidence of the absolute effectiveness of haloperidol for people with long‐term aggression. One study randomising 110 chronically aggressive people to three different antipsychotic drugs met the inclusion criteria. When haloperidol was compared with olanzapine or clozapine, skewed data (n=83) at high risk of bias suggested some advantage in terms of scale scores of unclear clinical meaning for olanzapine/clozapine for total aggression. Data were available for only one other outcome, leaving the study early. When compared with other antipsychotic drugs, people allocated to haloperidol were no more likely to leave the study (1 RCT, n=110, RR 1.37, CI 0.84 to 2.24,  low‐quality evidence ). Although there were some data for the outcomes listed above, there were no data on most of the binary outcomes and none on service outcomes (use of hospital/police), satisfaction with treatment, acceptance of treatment, quality of life or economics. Authors conclusions Only one study could be included and most data were heavily skewed, almost impossible to interpret and of low quality.  There were also some limitations in the study design with unclear description of allocation concealment and high risk of bias for selective reporting, so no firm conclusions can be made. This review shows how trials in this group of people are possible ‐ albeit difficult. Further relevant trials are needed to evaluate use of haloperidol in treatment of long‐term/persistent aggression in people living with psychosis. Plain language summary Haloperidol for long‐term aggression in psychosis Background People experiencing distressing delusions and hallucinations can often become agitated and aggressive. The antipsychotic drug haloperidol is widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis‐induced agitation despite the possibility it can cause a number of serious side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, restlessness and muscle spasms. Study characteristics The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group ran an electronic search for clinical trials involving the use of haloperidol for psychosis‐induced aggression in July 2011 and April 2015. We found one study with 110 participants, diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants had been physically aggressive during recent hospitalisation and involved in at least one other aggressive event. The study randomised participants to receive either haloperidol, clozapine or olanzapine. Key results Most data presented were impossible to use and it is unclear if haloperidol is effective for reducing aggression or improving mental state for people who are aggressive due to psychosis. There were no data regarding side effects. The number of people leaving the study early from each treatment group was similar. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence available is low, only one study with a high risk of selective reporting of results provided data. No firm conclusions can be made until further good‐quality data are available."""

Objectives To determine the best range of doses for haloperidol for the treatment of people acutely ill with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria We selected studies if they involved people being treated for acute schizophrenia, randomised to two or more dose ranges of non‐depot haloperidol, and if they reported clinically meaningful outcomes. Data collection and analysis For this update, we inspected all citations and independently re‐inspected a sample of citations in order to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, and where doubt remained, we acquired the full‐text article for further inspection. We then ordered papers, and reliably re‐inspected and quality assessed the full reports, and extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) basis. We assumed that people who left the study early or were lost to follow‐up had a negative outcome. We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes that reported ITT, last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. We excluded data if loss to follow‐up was greater than 50%. Main results We included 19 trials with 19 different randomised dose comparisons. No studies reported data on relapse rates or quality of life and only one compared low dose (> 1.5 to 3 mg/day) haloperidol to higher dose ranges. Using standard lower dose (> 3 to 7.5 mg/day) did not result in loss of efficacy (no clinically important improvement in global state, versus standard higher dose (> 7.5 to 15 mg/day, n = 48, 1 RCT, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.8,  very‐low‐quality evidence ); versus high dose (> 15 to 35 mg/day, n = 81, 2 RCTs, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2,  very‐low‐quality evidence ). Doses of haloperidol in the range of > 3 to 7.5 mg/day had a lower rate of development of clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects than higher doses (clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects, versus standard higher dose, n = 64, 2 RCTs, RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.1,  very‐low‐quality evidence ); versus high dose, n = 144, 3 RCTs, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8, very‐low‐quality evidence; versus very high dose (> 35 mg/day, n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.1,  very‐low‐quality evidence ). None of the other comparisons between dose ranges yielded statistically significant differences, but several, particularly with lower dose ranges, were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences. Authors conclusions Noresults were conclusive and all were based on small, short studies of limited quality. However, it would be understandable if clinicians were cautious in prescribing doses in excess of 7.5 mg/day of haloperidol to a person with uncomplicated acute schizophrenia, and if people with schizophrenia were equally reticent to take greater doses. Further research is needed regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the lower dose ranges, especially > 1.5 to 3 mg/day. Plain language summary Haloperidol dose for the acute phase of schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental illness where the person often experiences both positive symptoms (such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs) and negative symptoms (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, is one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide for people with schizophrenia. The benefits of antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, need to be weighed against their tendency for causing debilitating side effects (such as movement disorders, weight gain, lack of drive) and in some cases an increased likelihood of physical illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. These debilitating side effects may mean that people stop taking their medication, which can lead to relapse and going into hospital. It is, therefore, important to find a tolerable and effective dose of haloperidol, which helps control the symptoms of schizophrenia but with fewer side effects. The main aim of this review was to determine the best range of doses of haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia. Nineteen trials were included that compared varying doses of haloperidol. Despite over 30 years of trials, data on the effects of differing doses of haloperidol are sparse and poorly reported. This is especially so for the lower dose ranges generally used for the treatment of schizophrenia today. However, lower doses of haloperidol may be just as effective as higher doses but result in fewer side effects. This review also suggests that an important bias against haloperidol may exist in modern trials comparing new drugs with haloperidol. Results are not conclusive and are based on small, short studies of limited quality. The authors of the review note that it would be understandable if psychiatrists were cautious about prescribing doses above 7.5 mg a day and if people with schizophrenia did not want to take higher dosages. Further research is needed to assess the tolerability and effectiveness of lower doses. Low doses of haloperidol may be just as good as higher doses, but with fewer side effects.

Haloperidol, one of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs, is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia but can have adverse side effects. The effects of stopping haloperidol in people with schizophrenia who are stable on their prescription are not well researched in the context of systematic reviews. Objectives To review the effects of haloperidol discontinuation in people with schizophrenia who are stable on haloperidol. Search methods On 20 February 2015, 24 May 2017, and 12 January 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials including trial registers. Selection criteria We included clinical trials randomising adults with schizophrenia or related disorders who were receiving haloperidol, and were stable. We included trials that randomised such participants to either continue their current treatment with haloperidol or discontinue their haloperidol treatment. We included trials that met our selection criteria and reported usable data. Data collection and analysis We independently checked all records retrieved from the search and obtained full reports of relevant records for closer inspection. We extracted data from included studies independently. All usable data were dichotomous, and we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias within the included studies and used GRADE to create a Summary of findings table. Main results We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 232 participants comparing haloperidol discontinuation with haloperidol continuation. Discontinuation was achieved in all five studies by replacing haloperidol with placebo. The trials size ranged between 23 and 87 participants. The methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were poorly reported. Participants allocated to discontinuing haloperidol treatment were more likely to show no improvement in global state compared with those in the haloperidol continuation group (n = 49; 1 RCT; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.20; very low quality evidence"""

Gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist drugs, which have intense sedative properties and may exacerbate psychotic symptoms, have been used to treat TD. Objectives 1. Primary objective The primary objective was to determine whether using non‐benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs for at least six weeks was clinically effective for the treatment of antipsychotic‐induced TD in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses. 2. Secondary objectives The secondary objectives were as follows. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than six weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow‐up. To examine whether there was a differential effect between the various compounds. To test the hypothesis that GABA agonist drugs are most effective for a younger age group (less than 40 years old). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (last searched April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials, and, when necessary, contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of non‐benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs in people with antipsychotic‐induced TD and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted and analysed data on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results We included 11 studies that randomised 343 people. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, participants and outcome assessors were not clearly blinded. For some studies we were unsure if data were complete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported. Data from six trials showed that there may be a clinically important improvement in TD symptoms after GABA agonist treatment compared with placebo at six to eight weeks follow‐up (6 RCTs, n = 258, RR 0.83, CI 0.74 to 0.92;  low‐quality evidence ). Data from five studies showed no difference between GABA agonist treatment and placebo for deterioration of TD symptoms (5 RCTs, n = 136, RR 1.90, CI 0.70 to 5.16; very low‐quality evidence). Studies reporting adverse events found a significant effect favouring placebo compared with baclofen, sodium valproate or progabide for dizziness/confusion (3 RCTs, n = 62 RR 4.54, CI 1.14 to 18.11;  very low‐quality evidence ) and sedation/drowsiness (4 RCTS, n = 144, RR 2.29, CI 1.08 to 4.86;  very low‐quality evidence ).

Plain language summary Gamma‐aminobutyric acid agonists for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question . To determine the effects of gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia for people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems. Background . People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high‐dose antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. GABA agonist drugs have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia but have intense sedative properties and may make mental health or psychotic symptoms worse. GABA agonist drugs include baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate, and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol (THIP). Study characteristics . The review includes 11 studies investigating the use of GABA agonist drugs compared with placebo. All studies involved small numbers of participants (2 to 80 people) with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. Key results . Evidence of the effects of GABA agonist drugs in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is not conclusive and not convincing. Any possible benefits of GABA agonist drugs are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their use. Quality of the evidence . Evidence is weak, short term, small scale and poorly reported. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.

Galantamine can improve cognitive function and slow the decline of AD in the general population over time. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population.

Folic acid supplements may sometimes therefore include vitamin B12 supplements with simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Lesser degrees of folate inadequacy are associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine which has been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer\s disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplementation can improve cognitive function in the elderly. However, any apparent benefit from folic acid which was given in combination with B12 needs to be ""corrected"" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function has therefore been published. Objectives To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy or demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress.

Several studies have previously reviewed the efficacy and tolerability of fluvoxamine for the treatment of major depression. However, these reviews are now outdated. Objectives Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability and side effect profile of fluvoxamine for major depression in comparison with other anti‐depressive agents, including tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs, SNRIs, other newer agents and other conventional psychotropic drugs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register. Trial databases and ongoing trial registers in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia, were handsearched for randomised controlled trials. We checked reference lists of the articles included in the review, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of affective disorder for published reports and citations of unpublished research. The date of last search was 31 August 2008. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials, published in any language, that compared fluvoxamine with any other active antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors inspected citations and abstracts, obtained papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). A random effects model was used to combine studies. Main results A total of 54 randomised controlled trials (n = 5122) were included. No strong evidence was found to indicate that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to other antidepressants regarding response, remission and tolerability. However, differing side effect profiles were evident, especially with regard to gastrointestinal side effects of fluvoxamine when compared to other antidepressants. For example, fluvoxamine was generally associated with a higher incidence of vomiting/nausea (versus imipramine, OR 2.23, CI 1.59 to 3.14; versus clomipramine, OR 2.13, CI 1.06 to 4.27; versus amitriptyline, OR 2.86, CI 1.31 to 2.63). Authors conclusions We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, differing side effect profiles were evident. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations, including these differences in side effect profiles. Plain language summary Fluvoxamine versus other anti‐depressive agents for depression Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay for treatment of moderate or severe depression. Fluvoxamine is one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. This review reports trials comparing fluvoxamine with other antidepressants for treatment of major depression. We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression.

Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between any other antipsychotic compounds, however, low‐potency antipsychotic drugs are often perceived as less efficacious than high‐potency compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. This review examined the effects of the high‐potency antipsychotic fluphenazine compared to those of low‐potency antipsychotics. Objectives To review the effects of fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2010). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluphenazine with first‐generation low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes seven randomised trials and 1567 participants that compared fluphenazine with low‐potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 40 and 438 participants. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported. Fluphenazine was not significantly different from low‐potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (fluphenazine 55%, low‐potency drug 55%, 2 RCTs, n = 105, RR 1.06 CI 0.75 to 1.50,  moderate quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal numbers of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (fluphenazine 36%, low‐potency antipsychotics 36%, 6 RCTs, n = 1532, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.14,  moderate quality evidence ). There was no significant difference between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics for numbers experiencing at least one adverse effect (fluphenazine 70%, low‐potency antipsychotics 88%, 1 RCT, n = 65, RR 0.79 CI 0.58 to 1.07,  moderate quality evidence ). However, at least one movement disorder occurred significantly more frequently in the fluphenazine group (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 10%, 3 RCTs, n = 971, RR 2.11 CI 1.41 to 3.15,  low quality of evidence ). In contrast, low‐potency antipsychotics produced significantly more sedation (fluphenazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 64%, 1 RCT, n = 65, RR 0.31 CI 0.13 to 0.77,  high quality evidence ). No data were available for the outcomes of death and quality of life. The results of the primary outcome were robust in a number of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Adverse effects such as  akathisia  (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 6%, 5 RCTs, n = 1209, RR 2.28 CI 1.58 to 3.28);  dystonia  (fluphenazine 5%, low‐potency antipsychotics 2%, 4 RCTs, n = 1309, RR 2.66 CI 1.25 to 5.64);  loss of associated movement  (fluphenazine 20%, low‐potency antipsychotics 2%, 1 RCT, n = 338, RR 11.15 CI 3.95 to 31.47);  rigor  (fluphenazine 27%, low‐potency antipsychotics 12%, 2 RCTs, n = 403, RR 2.18 CI 1.20 to 3.97); and  tremor  (fluphenazine 15%, low‐potency antipsychotics 6%, 2 RCTs, n = 403, RR 2.53 CI 1.37 to 4.68) occurred significantly more frequently in the fluphenazine group. For other adverse effects such as  dizziness  (fluphenazine 8%, low‐potency antipsychotics 17%, 4 RCTs, n = 1051, RR 0.49 CI 0.32 to 0.73);  drowsiness  (fluphenazine 18%, low‐potency antipsychotics 25%, 3 RCTs, n = 986, RR 0.67 CI 0.53 to 0.86);  dry mouth  (fluphenazine 11%, low‐potency antipsychotics 18%, 4 RCTs, n = 1051, RR 0.63 CI 0.45 to 0.89);  nausea  (fluphenazine 4%, low‐potency antipsychotics 15%, 3 RCTs, n = 986, RR 0.25 CI 0.14 to 0.45); and  vomiting  (fluphenazine 3%, low‐potency antipsychotics 8%, 3 RCTs, n = 986, RR 0.36 CI 0.18 to 0.72) results favoured fluphenazine with significantly more events occurring in the low‐potency antipsychotic group for these outcomes. Authors conclusions The results do not show a clear difference in efficacy between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. The number of included studies was low and their quality moderate. Therefore, further studies would be needed to draw firm conclusions about the relative effects of fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. Plain language summary Fluphenazine versus low‐potency antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). It is a serious, often long lasting, mental illness that can have a severe detrimental effect on all aspects of the sufferers life. Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia. Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic that is effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, most antipsychotics have side effects and when compared to newer antipsychotic drugs, fluphenazine is thought to be more likely to cause serious movement disorders such as involuntary shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness and the inability to sit still. Fluphenazine is also known to lower people’s mood. Prescribing low‐strength or low‐potency drugs can help reduce side effects but are often seen as less effective in treating symptoms. This review examined the effects of the high‐potency antipsychotic fluphenazine compared with those of low‐potency antipsychotics. A search for randomised trials comparing these types of drugs was carried out in 2010. The review includes seven studies with 1567 participants. Pooled data from two of these trials did not show a clear difference in effectiveness between fluphenazine and low‐potency antipsychotics. However, evidence showed fluphenazine produced more movement disorders than low‐potency antipsychotics, whereas the low‐potency drugs were more likely to cause dizziness, drowsiness and sedation, a dry mouth, nausea and sometimes even vomiting. The number of included studies was low and the quality of evidence provided was moderate. Therefore, further good quality studies would be needed to draw firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of fluphenazine compared to low‐potency antipsychotics. Important information on service use, going into hospital again (rehospitalisation), costs and quality of life was missing and not reported.

There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We sought all randomised controlled trials comparing oral fluphenazine with placebo relevant to people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were global state and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis For the effects of interventions, a review team inspected citations and abstracts independently, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed trials. We extracted data independently. Dichotomous data were analysed using fixed‐effect risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were excluded if more than 50% of people were lost to follow‐up, but, where possible, mean differences (MD) were calculated. Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by an economic review team to provide an economic summary of available data. Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already‐included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary. Main results From over 1200 electronic records of 415 studies identified by our initial search and this updated search, we excluded 48 potentially relevant studies and included seven trials published between 1964 and 1999 that randomised 439 (mostly adult participants). No new included trials were identified for this review update. Compared with placebo, global state outcomes of not improved or worsened were not significantly different in the medium term in one small study (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 1.12 CI 0.79 to 1.58,  very low quality of evidence ). The risk of relapse in the long term was greater in two small studies in people receiving placebo (n = 86, 2 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.05 to 3.31,  very low quality of evidence ), however with high degree of heterogeneity in the results. Only one person allocated fluphenazine was reported in the same small study to have died on long‐term follow‐up (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 2.38 CI 0.10 to 55.72,  low quality of evidence ). Short‐term extrapyramidal adverse effects were significantly more frequent with fluphenazine compared to placebo in two other studies for the outcomes of akathisia (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.43 CI 1.23 to 9.56,  moderate quality of evidence ) and rigidity (n = 227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.54 CI 1.76 to 7.14,  moderate quality of evidence ). For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes for relapse and presented them in additional tables. Authors conclusions The findings in this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know, but they provide quantification to support clinical impression. Fluphenazines global position as an effective treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the outcome of this review. However, fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment and if accessible, other inexpensive drugs less associated with adverse effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia.

It has been commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia, however, with the advent of atypical antipsychotic medications, use has declined over the years. Objectives To measure the outcomes (both beneficial and harmful) of the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of oral fluphenazine versus atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Studies (25 April 2013). For the economic search, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Health Economic Database (CSzGHED) on 31 January 2014 Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluphenazine (oral) with any other oral atypical antipsychotics. Data collection and analysis Review authors worked independently to inspect citations and assess the quality of the studies and to extract data. For homogeneous dichotomous data we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and calculated the mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results Four studies randomising a total of 202 people with schizophrenia are included. Oral fluphenazine was compared with oral amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine. Comparing oral fluphenazine with amisulpride, there was no difference between groups for mental state using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (1 RCT, n = 57, MD 5.10 95% CI ‐2.35 to 12.55,  very low‐quality evidence ), nor was there any difference in numbers leaving the study early for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 98, RR 1.19 95% CI 0.63 to 2.28,  very low‐quality evidence ). More people required concomitant anticholinergic medication in the fluphenazine group compared to amisulpride (1 RCT, n = 36, RR 7.82 95% CI 1.07 to 57.26,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for important outcomes including relapse, changes in life skills, quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. Comparing oral fluphenazine with risperidone, data showed no difference between groups for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 26, RR 0.67 95% CI 0.13 to 3.35,  very low‐quality evidence ) nor leaving the study early due to inefficacy (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 1.08 95% CI 0.08 to 15.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported data for relapse; change in life skills; quality of life; extrapyramidal adverse effects; or cost‐effectiveness. Once again there was no difference when oral fluphenazine was compared with quetiapine for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 0.62 95% CI 0.12 to 3.07,  very low‐quality evidence ), nor leaving the study early for any reason (1 RCT, n = 25, RR 0.46 95% CI 0.05 to 4.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for relapse; clinically important change in life skills; quality of life; extrapyramidal adverse effects; or cost‐effectiveness. Compared to olanzapine, fluphenazine showed no superiority for clinically important response (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.86 to 2.07,  very low‐quality evidence ), in incidence of akathisia (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.90 to 10.01,  very low‐quality evidence ) or in people leaving the study early (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.33 to 27.23,  very low‐quality evidence ). No data were reported for relapse; change in life skills; quality of life; or cost‐effectiveness. Authors conclusions Measures of clinical response and mental state do not highlight differences between fluphenazine and amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Largely measures of adverse effects are also unconvincing for substantive differences between fluphenazine and the newer drugs. All included trials carry a substantial risk of bias regarding reporting of adverse effects and this bias would have favoured the newer drugs. The four small short included studies do not provide much clear information about the relative merits  or disadvantages  of oral fluphenazine compared with newer atypical antipsychotics. Plain language summary Comparing effectiveness of an older antipsychotic (oral fluphenazine) with newer antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia Introduction \u2028 People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). It is a distressing and debilitating illness. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Fluphenazine is an older antipsychotic drug first formulated in the 1950s, effective for treating the psychoses of schizophrenia. However fluphenazine can cause some serious side effects, particularly movement disorders, and is known to lower people’s mood. Fluphenazine is inexpensive but the arrival of newer antipsychotic drugs with fewer movement disorder side effects reduced its use and market share. Methods \u2028 An electronic search of Cochrane Schizophrenias register of studies was carried out in 2013. Review authors looked for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either oral fluphenazine or an atypical antipsychotic. Four studies with a total of 202 people with schizophrenia could be included. The trials compared fluphenazine with either amisulpride, risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. Results \u2028 Data showed oral fluphenazine is no better or worse in improving mental state than amisulpride but more people receiving oral fluphenazine did need to take additional anticholinergic medication (drugs used to help relieve a range of symptoms such as involuntary movements of the muscles, high blood pressure and insomnia). Data from the trials comparing oral fluphenazine with either risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine also showed no superiority between the treatment groups for clinical improvement. Only the trial comparing oral fluphenazine with olanzapine provided adverse‐effects data. Again, incidence of akathisia, a movement disorder, was similar between treatment groups. Quality of evidence \u2028 Evidence from these few trials is poor, of low quality and involves a small number of participants. It does not provide clear overall information about whether oral fluphenazine is better or worse than atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Data were not available for important outcomes such as such, relapse, hospital admission, satisfaction, costs and quality of life. Adverse‐effects data were poorly reported. Future large‐scale research should report on these important outcomes. Conclusions \u2028 Fluphenazine is low cost and widely available, so is likely to remain one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. However, evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials about its effectiveness compared to atypical antipsychotics is unclear."""

For rare events we analysed dichotomous data using Peto Odds ratio (OR), again with 95% CIs. Main results We could include only one small (n = 45) study of moderate quality. When the active α‐flupenthixol was compared with the inactive placebo or β‐flupenthixol groups combined, fewer people in the active treatment group needed additional antipsychotic medication by around four weeks for deterioration in their general state (n = 45, OR 0.19 CI 0.05 to 0.71). There was no clear difference in social functioning at one year (n = 45, RR 1.33 CI 0.91 to 1.96). We found no clear data on mental state and behaviour, adverse effects, service use, satisfaction with treatment or costs. Authors conclusions We were surprised that this well‐established drug had so few data from trials investigating its absolute effects. We think this is unlikely to be rectified some 50 years after its launch and know that this would not happen today. However, even though data are very limited, flupenthixol may well be worthy of careful investigation ‐ partly to ensure that this inexpensive active drug is not forgotten.

The main side‐effects are shaking, restlessness, a dry mouth and some weight gain. Although this drug has been available for many years, few systematic reviews of its effectiveness are available and the effects of this drug in helping people cope with the symptoms of schizophrenia are not currently well measured, quantified and known. This systematic review could include only one small study which was small and 30 years old. Flupenthixol was compared with a placebo (dummy drug). Fewer people taking flupenthixol required additional antipsychotic medication but there was no clear difference in people’s ability to cope and function socially. There was no clear information on"""

Main results The review currently includes one randomised trial from mainland China with 153 participants that lasted two months and compared flupenthixol with chlorpromazine. The exact methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment were not reported, and medication was provided in an open manner.

Authors conclusions The evidence base of flupenthixol versus low‐potency first‐generation antipsychotics is currently restricted to one randomised comparison with chlorpromazine. The few reported data do not suggest a difference in efficacy, but flupenthixol appeared to produce more movement disorders and dizziness, while chlorpromazine was associated with the anticholinergic side effect ‐ dryness of mouth.

Objectives To evaluate the effects of flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot neuroleptic preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses, in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Search methods We identified relevant trials by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in March 2009 and then for this update version, a search was run in April 2013. The register is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials that focused on people with schizophrenia or other similar psychotic disorders where flupenthixol decanoate had been compared with placebo or other antipsychotic drugs were included. All clinically relevant outcomes were sought. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. We summated normal continuous data using mean difference (MD), and 95% CIs using a fixed‐effect model. We presented scale data only for those tools that had attained prespecified levels of quality. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) we created Summary of findings tables and assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results The review currently includes 15 randomised controlled trials with 626 participants. No trials compared flupenthixol decanoate with placebo. One small study compared flupenthixol decanoate with an oral antipsychotic (penfluridol). Only two outcomes were reported with this single study, and it demonstrated no clear differences between the two preparations as regards leaving the study early (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 3.00, CI 0.33 to 27.23, very low quality evidence ) and requiring anticholinergic medication (1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.19, CI 0.77 to 1.83,  very low quality evidence ). Ten studies in total compared flupenthixol decanoate with other depot preparations, though not all studies reported on all outcomes of interest. There were no significant differences between depots for outcomes such as relapse at medium term (n = 221, 5 RCTs, RR 1.30, CI 0.87 to 1.93,  low quality evidence ), and no clinical improvement at short term (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.67, CI 0.36 to 1.23,  low quality evidence ). There was no difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early at short/medium term (n = 161, 4 RCTs, RR 1.23, CI 0.76 to 1.99,  low quality evidence ) nor with numbers of people requiring anticholinergic medication at short/medium term (n = 102, 3 RCTs, RR 1.38, CI 0.75 to 2.25,  low quality evidence ). Three studies in total compared high doses (100 to 200 mg) of flupenthixol decanoate with the standard doses (˜40mg) per injection. Two trials found relapse at medium term (n = 18, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.27 to 3.69,  low quality evidence ) to be similar between the groups. However people receiving a high dose had slightly more favourable medium term mental state results on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 18, 1 RCT, MD ‐10.44, CI ‐18.70 to ‐2.18,  low quality evidence ). There was also no significant difference in the use of anticholinergic medications to deal with side effects at short term (2 RCTs n = 47, RR 1.12, CI 0.83 to 1.52  very low quality evidence ). One trial comparing a very low dose of flupenthixol decanoate (˜6 mg) with a low dose (˜9 mg) per injection reported no difference in relapse rates (n = 59, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, CI 0.10 to 1.15,  low quality evidence ). Authors conclusions In the current state of evidence, there is nothing to choose between flupenthixol decanoate and other depot antipsychotics. From the data reported in clinical trials, it would be understandable to offer standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. However, data reported are of low or very low quality and this review highlights the need for large, well‐designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the effects of flupenthixol decanoate. Plain language summary Depot flupenthixol decanoate for schizophrenia or other similar mental illnesses Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects thinking and perception. It often develops in early adult‐hood and can have a lifelong impact on not only the mental well‐being of the sufferer, but their social and general functioning. Worldwide around 15 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with schizophrenia every year. The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotics are usually given as tablets by mouth (orally). However, people with mental illness often have difficulties with accepting medication (compliance). Their illness affects their thinking, which can erode their understanding of their illness and they often do not see the need for treatment. Taking antipsychotics can also have unpleasant side effects. Oral medication requires regular self‐administration otherwise effectiveness is reduced and the risk of relapse is high. A solution to poor compliance is depot medication where medication is given by injection and is slowly released over a period of weeks. For people with schizophrenia it was hoped to be able to maintain care in the community with regular injections administered by community psychiatric nurses. Initial enthusiasm and the favourable results of clinical trials gave rise to the extensive use of depots as a means of long‐term treatment. Flupenthixol decanoate is one of the most widely used depot antipsychotics in the UK. This review looks at the effectiveness of depot flupenthixol decanoate in comparison with no active treatment (placebo), oral antipsychotics and other depot preparations for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. An electronic search for relevant trials was carried out in 2013. Fifteen trials with 626 participants could be included. All evidence from these trials was rated by the authors to be  low  or  very low quality.  Currently, from the data reported, there is nothing to choose between depot flupenthixol decanoate and other depot or oral antipsychotics. There was some evidence that it would be understandable to offer a standard dose rather than the high dose depot flupenthixol as there is no difference in relapse. Overall, this review highlights the lack of evidence based information available for the review question and the need for large, well‐designed and reported randomised clinical trials to address the medical, social, personal and economic effects of flupenthixol decanoate.

Alone, however, they are not sufficient to control symptoms and maintain psychosocial functioning. Adjunctive psychosocial interventions may help to improve the patients condition and the course of the illness. Family interventions are deserving of special attention, since they may help to relieve the burden of care borne by relatives and caregivers, which in turn may facilitate the task of supporting the patient. Objectives The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of family interventions in the treatment of bipolar disorder compared with no intervention and other forms of intervention. Search methods We searched the electronic databases CCDANRCT‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References on 1/8/2007, CENTRAL (2006‐3), MEDLINE (2006), EMBASE (2006) and LILACS (2006), and searched the reference lists of included studies. We also made personal contact with authors. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. Participants were people with bipolar disorder and their relatives or caregivers; family psychosocial interventions of any type were considered; primary outcomes were changes in the status of symptoms and relapse rates. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Quality assessment of included studies was carried out. The findings were presented descriptively. Where there were sufficient studies, dichotomous data were combined using relative risk, and continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference, with their 95% CIs. Main results Seven RCTs were included in the review, involving a total of 393 participants. All of the included studies assessed psychoeducational methods, and one study also assessed a type of systems psychotherapy. In all trials, participants continued to receive pharmacotherapy treatment. Due to the diversity of interventions, outcome measures and endpoints used across studies, it was not possible to perform meta‐analyses for primary outcomes. Five studies compared a variety of family interventions, involving carers, families or spouses, against no intervention, with individual findings indicating no significant added effect for family interventions. Three studies compared one type or modality of family intervention against another family intervention, with inconsistent findings. Authors conclusions To date there is only a small and heterogeneous body of evidence on the effectiveness of family oriented approaches for bipolar disorder, and it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions to support their use as an adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder. Further well designed RCTs should be a research priority. Plain language summary Family interventions for bipolar disorder Drug treatments are the primary treatment for bipolar disorder. Alone, however, they are not sufficient to manage the disorder. Studies on psychosocial interventions for mental disorders such as schizophrenia and anxiety show that they are effective treatments. Reports in the literature suggest that they may be useful for people with bipolar disorder as well. The role of the family is important in the care of people with bipolar disorder, with effective family functioning helping to maintain a persons psychological balance. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of any psychosocial family intervention for people with bipolar disorder and/or their families and carers. Seven randomised controlled trials (393 participants) were included in the review, all of which evaluated psychoeducational interventions. Five studies compared family interventions against no treatment, and three studies compared one type or delivery of family intervention against another family intervention. Differences in the interventions, outcome measures and end points used in the trials did not allow us to perform a meta‐analysis. Whilst results from individual studies did not suggest a significant effect for family interventions when added to drug therapy, the studies provide insufficient evidence to draw conclusions which can be generalised to everyday practice. Further research using appropriate randomised controlled trial methodology and evaluating family interventions other than psychoeducation is called for in this under‐researched and important topic."""

Forms of psychosocial intervention, designed to reduce these levels of expressed emotions within families, are now widely used. Objectives To estimate the effects of family psychosocial interventions in community settings for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like conditions compared with standard care. Search methods We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (September 2008). Selection criteria We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised studies focusing primarily on families of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that compared community‐orientated family‐based psychosocial intervention with standard care. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and calculated fixed‐effect relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary data, and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). Main results This 2009‐10 update adds 21 additional studies, with a total of 53 randomised controlled trials included. Family intervention may decrease the frequency of relapse (n = 2981, 32 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.5 to 0.6, NNT 7 CI 6 to 8), although some small but negative studies might not have been identified by the search. Family intervention may also reduce hospital admission (n = 481, 8 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.6 to 1.0, NNT 8 CI 6 to 13) and encourage compliance with medication (n = 695, 10 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 6 CI 5 to 9) but it does not obviously affect the tendency of individuals/families to leave care (n = 733, 10 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.5 to 1.0). Family intervention also seems to improve general social impairment and the levels of expressed emotion within the family. We did not find data to suggest that family intervention either prevents or promotes suicide. Authors conclusions Family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers. However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. Further data from trials that describe the methods of randomisation, test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings. Plain language summary Family intervention for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia are more likely to experience a relapse within family groups when there are high levels of expressed emotion (hostility, criticism or over involvement) within the family, compared to families who tend to be less expressive of their emotions. There are several psychosocial interventions available involving education, support and management to reduce expressed emotion within families. In this review we compare the effects of family psychosocial interventions in community settings for the care of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. \u2028 \u2028 Studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and North America with packages of family intervention varying among studies, although there were no clear differences in study design. Results indicated that family intervention may reduce the risk of relapse and improve compliance with medication. However data were often inadequately reported and therefore unusable. As this package of care is widely employed, there should be further research to properly clarify several of the short‐term and long‐term outcomes."""

Forms of psychosocial intervention, designed to promote positive environments and reduce these levels of expressed emotions within families, are now widely used. Objectives To assess the effects of brief family interventions for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All relevant randomised studies that compared brief family‐oriented psychosocial interventions with standard care, focusing on families of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were selected. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we estimated a mean difference (MD) between groups and their 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess quality of evidence for main outcomes of interest and created a Summary of findings table. We assessed risk of bias for included studies. Main results Four studies randomising 163 people could be included in the review. It is not clear if brief family intervention reduces the utilisation of health services by patients, as most results are equivocal at long term and only one study reported data for the primary outcomes of interest of hospital admission (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.11,  very low quality evidence ). Data for relapse are also equivocal by medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.43,  low quality evidence ). However, data for the family outcome of understanding of family member significantly favoured brief family intervention (n = 70, 1 RCT, MD 14.90, 95% CI 7.20 to 22.60,  very low quality evidence ). No study reported data for other outcomes of interest including days in hospital; adverse events; medication compliance; quality of life or satisfaction with care; or any economic outcomes. Authors conclusions The findings of this review are not outstanding due to the size and quality of studies providing data; the analysed outcomes were also minimal, with no meta‐analysis possible. All outcomes in the Summary of findings table were rated  low or very low quality evidence . However, the importance of brief family intervention should not be dismissed outright, with the present state of demand and resources available. The designs of such brief interventions could be modified to be more effective with larger studies, which may then have enough power to inform clinical practice. Plain language summary Brief family intervention for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects a persons thoughts, perceptions and emotions. Research has found that the chance of someone with mental illness having a relapse is greater when their family is over‐involved, hostile, critical and dissatisfied ‐ a concept known as expressed emotions. Family interventions have been shown to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia and are now widely used. They are designed to promote positive family environments and reduce levels of expressed emotions within families as well as providing insight into the signs and symptoms of mental illness, so family members can anticipate and help stop relapse.

Access to face‐to‐face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e‐health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of e‐health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting‐list controls, or non‐psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Groups Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 ‐ 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross‐search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand‐searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating any type of long‐term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long‐term physical conditions as those that were more than three‐months duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient‐ or clinician‐administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 ( American Psychological Association 2013 ), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria ( World Health Organization 1992 ). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non‐psychological therapies were eligible comparators. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta‐analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. Main results We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta‐analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low‐quality evidence that e‐health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.83, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long‐term physical condition, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. Authors conclusions At present, the field of e‐health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low‐quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. Although it is too early to recommend e‐health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically‐based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Plain language summary E‐health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions Why is this review important? More than one in ten children and adolescents worldwide have long‐term physical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems, which include anxiety or depression. Treating such problems early can prevent difficulties with friendships, family life, school, and future mental health problems. Accessing traditionally delivered face‐to‐face therapy can be difficult, due to the limited number of services. As technology improves, and therapies become available on computers and mobile telephones, e‐health interventions (delivered by digital means and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) may be useful to treat anxiety and depression in these children and adolescents. Who will be interested in this review? This review will be of interest to parents, children and adolescents, mental healthcare providers, service commissioners, and professionals caring for children with long‐term physical conditions.

There is no specific diagnostic test, therefore diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose CFS. The prevalence of CFS varies by type of diagnostic criteria used. Existing treatment strategies primarily aim to relieve symptoms and improve function. One treatment option is exercise therapy. Objectives The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for adults with CFS compared with any other intervention or control on fatigue, adverse outcomes, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, mood disorders, sleep, self‐perceived changes in overall health, health service resources use and dropout. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group controlled trials register, CENTRAL, and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014, using a comprehensive list of free‐text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished and ongoing studies through the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to May 2014. We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, from all diagnostic criteria, who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, Risk of bias assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). To facilitate interpretation of SMDs, we re‐expressed SMD estimates as MDs on more common measurement scales. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included eight RCTs with data from 1518 participants. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured effect at the end of the treatment and at long‐term follow‐up, after 50 weeks or 72 weeks. Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapies such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, and one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control, including treatment as usual, relaxation or flexibility (eight studies); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (two studies); cognitive therapy (one study); supportive listening (one study); pacing (one study); pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Most studies had a low risk of selection bias. All had a high risk of performance and detection bias. Exercise therapy compared with passive control Exercise therapy probably reduces fatigue at end of treatment (SMD −0.66, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.31; 7 studies, 840 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence; re‐expressed MD −3.4, 95% CI −5.3 to −1.6; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain if fatigue is reduced in the long term because the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD −0.62, 95 % CI −1.32 to 0.07; 4 studies, 670 participants; re‐expressed MD −3.2, 95% CI −6.9 to 0.4; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants). Exercise therapy may moderately improve physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long‐term effect is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Exercise therapy may also slightly improve sleep at end of treatment and at long term. The effect of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life and depression is uncertain because evidence is missing or of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with CBT Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to fatigue at end of treatment (MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐1.49 to 1.89; 1 study, 298 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or at long‐term follow‐up (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.28; 2 studies, 351 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96; 1 study, 321 participants). The available evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between exercise therapy and CBT in physical functioning or sleep (low‐certainty evidence) and probably little or no difference in the effect on depression (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise therapy compared to CBT improves quality of life or reduces pain because the evidence is of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with adaptive pacing Exercise therapy may slightly reduce fatigue at end of treatment (MD −2.00, 95% CI −3.57 to −0.43; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 305 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and at long‐term follow‐up (MD −2.50, 95% CI −4.16 to −0.84; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 307 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The available evidence suggests that exercise therapy may slightly improve physical functioning, depression and sleep compared to adaptive pacing (low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported quality of life or pain. Exercise therapy compared with antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressants, reduces fatigue and depression more than antidepressant alone, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. The one included study did not report on adverse reactions, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, sleep or long‐term results. Authors conclusions Exercise therapy probably has a positive effect on fatigue in adults with CFS compared to usual care or passive therapies. The evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of CBT, adaptive pacing or other interventions. All studies were conducted with outpatients diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria, or both. Patients diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects. Plain language summary Exercise as treatment for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome What is the aim of this review? People with chronic fatigue syndrome have long‐lasting fatigue, joint pain, headaches, sleep problems, poor concentration and short‐term memory. These symptoms cause significant disability and distress. We wanted to find out whether exercise therapy can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis). Key messages People who have exercise therapy probably have less fatigue at the end of treatment than those who receive more passive therapies. We are uncertain if this improvement lasts in the long term. We are also uncertain about the risk of serious side effects from exercise therapy. What was studied in the review? We explored whether exercise therapy can reduce chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms. We searched for studies comparing the effect of exercise therapy with treatment as usual or other therapies. What are the main results of the review? We found eight studies with 1518 participants. The studies compared participants who received exercise therapy to participants who received treatment as usual or more active treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Participants had exercise therapy for 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured the effect of the therapy at the end of the treatment and also long term, after 50 or 72 weeks. Participants exercised at different levels of intensity using variations of aerobic exercising such as walking, swimming or cycling. Exercise therapy compared to treatment as usual or relaxation Participants who have exercise therapy probably have less fatigue at the end of treatment, and they may have moderately better physical functioning. We are uncertain if these improvements last long term because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Participants who have exercise therapy may have slightly better sleep, both at the end of treatment and long term. We are uncertain about the risk of serious side effects and the effects of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life, and depression. This is because we lack evidence or because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to cognitive behavioural therapy Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to participants’ fatigue at end of treatment or in the long term. Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to participants’ physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long‐term effect on physical functioning is uncertain. No studies looked at the effect of exercise therapy on depression at the end of treatment, but it probably has little or no long‐term effect. We are uncertain about the risk of side effects. We are also uncertain about the effects on pain, quality of life, or sleep. This is because we lack evidence or because we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to adaptive pacing (living within limits) Participants who have exercise therapy may have slightly less fatigue and depressive symptoms and slightly better physical functioning and sleep at the end of treatment and long term than participants who have adaptive pacing. We are uncertain about the risk of serious side effects. We are also uncertain about the effect on quality of life or pain. This is because we lack evidence or we are very uncertain about the evidence. Exercise therapy compared to antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy is better than antidepressants at reducing fatigue. We are also uncertain of its effect on depression, side effects, pain, physical functioning, quality of life or sleep. This is because we lack evidence or we are very uncertain about the evidence. Why is this review important? Exercise therapy is recommended by treatment guidelines and often used as treatment for people with chronic fatigue syndrome. People with chronic fatigue syndrome should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment based on robust research evidence and whether exercise therapy is effective, either as a stand‐alone intervention or as part of a treatment plan. It is important to note that the evidence in this review is from people diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria. People diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects."""

Several recent trials and systematic reviews of the impact of exercise on people with dementia are reporting promising findings. Objectives Primary objective Do exercise programs for older people with dementia improve their cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, and mortality? Secondary objectives Do exercise programs for older people with dementia have an indirect impact on family caregivers’ burden, quality of life, and mortality? Do exercise programs for older people with dementia reduce the use of healthcare services (e.g. visits to the emergency department) by participants and their family caregivers? Search methods We identified trials for inclusion in the review by searching ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register, on 4 September 2011, on 13 August 2012, and again on 3 October 2013. Selection criteria In this review, we included randomized controlled trials in which older people, diagnosed with dementia, were allocated either to exercise programs or to control groups (usual care or social contact/activities) with the aim of improving cognition, ADLs, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, and mortality. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services. Data collection and analysis Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We analysed data for summary effects. We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed‐effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random‐effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events. Main results Seventeen trials with 1067 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three included trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants dementia, and type, duration, and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home. Our meta‐analysis revealed that there was no clear evidence of benefit from exercise on cognitive functioning. The estimated standardized mean difference between exercise and control groups was 0.43 (95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.92, P value 0.08; 9 studies, 409 participants). There was very substantial heterogeneity in this analysis (I² value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain, and we rated the quality of this evidence as very low. We found a benefit of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs in six trials with 289 participants. The estimated standardized mean difference between exercise and control groups was 0.68 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.27, P value 0.02). However, again we observed considerable unexplained heterogeneity (I² value 77%) in this meta‐analysis, and we rated the quality of this evidence as very low. This means that there is a need for caution in interpreting these findings. In further analyses, in one trial we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program. The mean difference between exercise and control groups was ‐15.30 (95% CI ‐24.73 to ‐5.87; 1 trial, 40 participants; P value 0.001). There was no apparent risk of bias in this study. In addition, there was no clear evidence of benefit from exercise on neuropsychiatric symptoms (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐4.22 to 3.02; 1 trial, 110 participants; P value .0.75), or depression (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.36; 5 trials, 341 participants; P value 0.16). We could not examine the remaining outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs, as either the appropriate data were not reported, or we did not retrieve trials that examined these outcomes. Authors conclusions There is promising evidence that exercise programs may improve the ability to perform ADLs in people with dementia, although some caution is advised in interpreting these findings. The review revealed no evidence of benefit from exercise on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest (i.e., mortality, caregiver burden, caregiver quality of life, caregiver mortality, and use of healthcare services). Plain language summary Exercise programs for people with dementia Background In future, as the population ages, the number of people in our communities suffering with dementia will rise dramatically. This will not only affect the quality of life of people with dementia but also increase the burden on family caregivers, community care, and residential care services. Exercise is one lifestyle factor that has been identified as a potential means of reducing or delaying progression of the symptoms of dementia. Study characteristics This review evaluated the results of 17 trials (search dates August 2012 and October 2013), including 1,067 participants, that tested whether exercise programs could improve cognition (which includes such things as memory, reasoning ability and spatial awareness), activities of daily living, behaviour and psychological symptoms (such as depression, anxiety and agitation) in older people with dementia. We also looked for effects on mortality, quality of life, caregivers experience and use of healthcare services, and for any adverse effects of exercise. Key findings There was some evidence that exercise programs can improve the ability of people with dementia to perform daily activities, but there was a lot of variation among trial results that we were not able to explain. The studies showed no evidence of benefit from exercise on cognition, psychological symptoms, and depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the other outcomes listed above. There was no evidence that exercise was harmful for the participants. We judged the overall quality of evidence behind most of the results to be very low. Conclusion Additional well‐designed trials would allow us to enhance the quality of the review by investigating the best type of exercise program for people with different types and severity of dementia and by addressing all of the outcomes."""

As these vulnerable periods to psychosis are associated with estrogen withdrawal, this hormone has been proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate the clinical effects of estrogens alone or in combination with progesterone, as a sole treatment or as an adjunctive therapy, for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods Electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (October 2003) was supplemented with manual reference inspection of all identified studies. Authors of trials were contacted for further material and archive information. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials comparing estrogens with or without progesterone, as a sole or adjunctive treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious, non‐affective psychotic illness. Data collection and analysis We evaluated data independently and analysed on an intention to treat basis. For binary data we calculated the fixed effect relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous non‐skewed data, we calculated weighted mean differences. Main results All available evidence relates to women. Four studies (n=108) compared estrogen only with placebo. Short‐term scores for general mental state showed no significant difference between groups (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD PANSS for 100mcg comparison ‐2.26 CI ‐15.4 to 10.9). Data from all four studies showed overall loss from the studies was low (˜5%), with no significant differences between groups (n=96, 4 RCTs, RR 0.95 CI 0.2 to 6.1). Skewed continuous data from two studies showed no clear differences in ratings of movement disorders. One medium‐term unpublished study (n=14) compared estrogen and progesterone with placebo. Data at six months showed no difference between groups for total scores (n=9, WMD PANSS ‐25.3 CI ‐51 to 0.1). For negative symptoms, results favoured the estrogen and progesterone group (n=9, WMD PANSS negative subscale ‐9.0 CI ‐17 to ‐0.9). For loss to follow up there was no difference between groups (n=10, RR 0.33 CI 0.02 to 6.7). This trial used many cognitive tests and one visual retention test showed statistically significant differences favouring the treatment group"""

During the last 20 years, antidepressant prescribing has risen dramatically in western countries, mainly because of the increasing consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and newer antidepressants, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram is the pure S‐enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with tricyclics, other SSRIs, heterocyclics and newer agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods Electronic databases were searched up to July 2008. Trial databases of drug‐approving agencies were hand‐searched for published, unpublished and ongoing controlled trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing escitalopram against any other antidepressant (including non‐conventional agents such as hypericum) for patients with major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used). Data collection and analysis Data were entered by two review authors (double data entry). Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI) using the random effects model. Main results Fourteen trials compared escitalopram with another SSRI and eight compared escitalopram with a newer antidepressive agent (venlafaxine, bupropion and duloxetine). Escitalopram was shown to be significantly more effective than citalopram in achieving acute response (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.87). Escitalopram was also more effective than citalopram in terms of remission (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93). Significantly fewer patients allocated to escitalopram withdrew from trials compared with patients allocated to duloxetine, for discontinuation due to any cause (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99). Authors conclusions Some statistically significant differences favouring escitalopram over other antidepressive agents for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found, in terms of efficacy (citalopram and fluoxetine) and acceptability (duloxetine). There is insufficient evidence to detect a difference between escitalopram and other antidepressants in early response to treatment (after two weeks of treatment). Cost‐effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Furthermore, as with most standard systematic reviews, the findings rely on evidence from direct comparisons. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should also be borne in mind. Plain language summary Escitalopram versus other antidepressive agents for depression Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram, the last SSRI introduced in the market, is the pure S‐enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Twenty‐two randomised controlled trials (about 4000 participants) were included in the present review. Escitalopram appears to be suitable as first‐line antidepressant treatment for people with moderate to severe major depression. It has been compared with only a few other antidepressants and so we are unable to say whether it is better, worse or the same as many of the other drugs used in practice. However, it did perform better than citalopram when we brought together the results of six studies in nearly two thousand patients"""

Search methods The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG),  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched in April 2008. Citation checking was undertaken. Where it was not possible to accept or reject, the full text of the citation was obtained for further evaluation. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies that evaluated the effectiveness of enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube or via a tube passed by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were planned to be included. In addition, controlled observational studies were included. The study population comprised adults aged 50 and over (either sex), with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia made according to validated diagnostic criteria such as DSM‐IV or ICD‐10 (APA 1994; WHO 1993) and with advanced cognitive impairment defined by a recognised and validated tool or by clinical assessment and had poor nutrition intake and/or develop problems with eating and swallowing. Where data were limited we also considered studies in which the majority of participants had dementia. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted and assessed by one reviewer, checked by a second and if necessary, in the case of any disagreement or discrepancy it was planned that it would be reviewed by the third reviewer. Where information was lacking, we attempted contact with authors. It was planned that meta‐analysis would be considered for RCTs with comparable key characteristics. The primary outcomes were survival and quality of life (QoL). Main results No RCTs were identified. Seven observational controlled studies were identified. Six assessed mortality. The other study assessed nutritional outcomes. There was no evidence of increased survival in patients receiving enteral tube feeding. None of the studies examined QoL and there was no evidence of benefit in terms of nutritional status or the prevalence of pressure ulcers.

This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim‐Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

This updated systematic review investigated the effect on cognitive function of the type of treatment and level of metabolic control in people with Type 2 diabetes. Objectives To assess the effects of different strategies for managing Type 2 diabetes mellitus on cognitive function and the incidence of dementia. Search methods We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG)), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS on 15 October 2016. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases, (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many trials registers and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared two or more different treatments for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and in which cognitive function was measured at baseline and after treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the included RCTs. We pooled data for comparable trials and estimated the effects of treatment by using risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), according to the nature of the outcome. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. Main results We identified seven eligible studies but only four provided data we could include in efficacy analyses. Two of these studies compared intensive versus standard glycaemic control and two compared different pharmacological treatments. All studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least two domains and one large study was at high risk of performance and detection bias. (a) Two studies with 13,934 participants at high cardiovascular risk provided efficacy data on intensive versus standard glycaemic control. A third study with 1791 participants provided additional data on hypoglycaemic episodes and mortality. There is probably no difference between treatment groups in the number of participants who decline by at least 3 points on the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) over five years (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08; 1 study; n = 11,140; moderate‐quality evidence); and there may also be little or no difference in the incidence of dementia (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.85; 1 study; n = 11,140; low‐quality evidence). From another study, there was probably little or no difference in MMSE score after 40 months (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.16; 1 study; n = 2794; moderate quality evidence). Participants exposed to the intensive glycaemic control strategy probably experience more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia than those who have standard treatment (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.14; 2 studies; n = 12,827; moderate‐quality evidence). The evidence from these trials suggests that the intensity of glycaemic control may have little or no effect on all‐cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.13; 3 studies; n = 15,888; low‐quality evidence). (b) One study with 156 participants compared glibenclamide (glyburide) with repaglinide. There may be a small advantage of glibenclamide on global cognitive function measured with the MMSE after 12 months (MD −0.90, 95% CI −1.68 to −0.12; low‐quality evidence). No data were reported on the incidence of dementia, hypoglycaemic events or all‐cause mortality. (c) One study with 145 participants compared rosiglitazone plus metformin to glibenclamide (glyburide) plus metformin over 24 weeks. It reported only on cognitive subdomains and not on global cognitive function, incidence of MCI or dementia, hypoglycaemic events or all causes of mortality. Authors conclusions We found no good evidence that any specific treatment or treatment strategy for Type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay cognitive impairment. The best available evidence related to the comparison of intensive with standard glycaemic control strategies. Here there was moderate‐quality evidence that the strategies do not differ in their effect on global cognitive functioning over 40 to 60 months. Plain language summary Effect of the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus on the development of cognitive impairment and dementia Background Dementia is a global healthcare concern. Type 2 diabetes mellitus — a form of diabetes which becomes commoner with older age — increases the risk of developing dementia. Type 1 diabetes, which typically begins earlier in life, is always treated with insulin; but there are a variety of different ways of treating Type 2 diabetes, including lifestyle changes and different medications. We wanted to find out if some ways of treating Type 2 diabetes were better than others in terms of preventing either dementia or less serious decline in cognition (memory and other thinking skills). What we did We searched medical databases for clinical trials in which participants had been assigned at random to different treatments for Type 2 diabetes and in which cognition had been measured at the beginning and end of the trial. We were only interested in treatments for Type 2 diabetes which are recommended by international clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We analysed data from the studies we found, looking for effects on dementia and cognition, death rates and the side effect of hypoglycaemia, which is when blood glucose levels fall too low and which can be a result of treatment. Key results We found seven randomised trials suitable for inclusion in this review, but we could only get data on cognition from four of them. Of these, the two larger studies had a total of 13,934 participants and compared a standard treatment strategy with a more intensive strategy which aimed to keep blood glucose lower. Two smaller studies, which each had approximately 150 participants, compared different drug treatments, but in both studies one of the treatments was a drug which is not generally considered suitable for older patients. We found no good evidence that any of the treatments in these studies was clearly superior to any other for preventing dementia or cognitive decline. An intensive treatment strategy was more likely than standard treatment to cause hypoglycaemia, but there were no differences in death rates. Quality of evidence We judged the quality of the evidence for all outcomes to be low or moderate due to risk of bias in the included studies, small sample sizes, and imprecise estimates of the effects. This means that our confidence in the results is limited."""

Stimulating and active teaching processes may be better at instilling information than more pedestrian approaches. Games involving repetition, reinforcement, association and use of multiple senses have been proposed as part of experiential learning. Objectives To assess the effects of educational games on the knowledge attainment and clinical skills of mental health professionals compared to the effects of standard teaching approaches. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2005), AMED (1998 ‐ November 2005), British Nursing Index (November 2005), Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2005), CINAHL (November 2005) EMBASE (November 2005), Educational Resources Information Centre on CSA (1966 ‐ November 2005), MEDLINE (November 2005) and PsycINFO (November 2005). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing any educational game aiming at increasing knowledge and/or skills with a standard educational approach for mental health professionals. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For individual person data we calculated the Odds Ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a fixed effects model. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed effects model. Main results We identified one trial (n=34) of an educational game for mental health nursing students of only a few hours follow up. For an outcome we arbitrarily defined (no academically important improvement a 10% improvement in scores) those allocated to educational games fared considerably better than students in the standard education techniques group (OR 0.06 CI 0.01 to 0.3, NNT 3 CI 2 to 4). On average those in the games group scored six more points than the control students on a test of questions relevant to psychosis set to the standard of the mental health nursing curriculum of the day (WMD 6.00 CI 2.6 to 9.4). Authors conclusions Current limited evidence suggests educational games could help mental health students gain more points in their tests, especially if they have left revision to the last minute. This salient study should be refined and repeated. Plain language summary Educational games for mental health professionals Standard teaching techniques in health care often contain traditional didactic elements. Learning from traditional didactic teaching has never been a very active process and can subsequently be tedious and tiring. In this review we wished to investigate the effects of more interactive ways of teaching mental health professionals. We identified one relevant trial which, although very small and short, did suggest quite a considerable short term positive effect for the more interactive teaching approach. On average, mental health nursing students who had been taught using this method scored six points more in a follow‐up test than students allocated to the standard teaching techniques. This interesting experiment should be reproduced to determine whether the increased knowledge is sustained and, if so, whether this produces better skills and attitudes."""

Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand‐searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and a double‐entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. Main results A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an antidepressive agent, quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.62 and OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55). Authors conclusions Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy. Plain language summary Duloxetine versus other antidepressive agents for depression Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression. During the last 20 years, newer compounds (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual action agents such as serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Duloxetine hydrochloride, one of the most recent antidepressants introduced in the market, is a selective serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor for oral administration. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Sixteen randomised controlled trials (5735 participants) were included. Duloxetine was not more effective than some other new antidepressant agents in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression, and it was less well tolerated than escitalopram and venlafaxine as more patients allocated to duloxetine withdrew treatment before study end. However, due to the limited number of studies per comparison these results should be interpreted with caution."""

Droperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, has been used for this purpose in several countries. Objectives To estimate the effects of droperidol, including its cost‐effectiveness, when compared to placebo, other standard or non‐standard treatments, or other forms of management of psychotic illness, in controlling acutely disturbed behaviour and reducing psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Search methods We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (18 December 2015). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted authors of trials. We supplemented these electronic searches by handsearching reference lists and contacting both the pharmaceutical industry and relevant authors. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with useable data that compared droperidol to any other treatment for people acutely ill with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder or a brief psychotic episode. Data collection and analysis For included studies, we assessed quality, risk of bias and extracted data. We excluded data when more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results We identified four relevant trials from the update search (previous version of this review included only two trials). When droperidol was compared with placebo, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31,  high‐quality evidence ). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for the droperidol group (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85,  high‐quality evidence ). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular arrhythmia (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31,  moderate‐quality evidence ) and respiratory airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.52,  low‐quality evidence ) than placebo. For being ready for discharge, there was no clear difference between groups (1 RCT, N = 227, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48,  high‐quality evidence ). There were no data for mental state and costs. Similarly, when droperidol was compared to haloperidol, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found evidence of a clear difference (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09,  high‐quality evidence ). There was a clear demonstration of reduced risk of needing additional medication after 60 minutes for participants in the droperidol group (2 RCTs, N = 255, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.90,  high‐quality evidence ). There was no evidence that droperidol caused more cardiovascular hypotension (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 26.49, moderate‐quality evidence ) and cardiovascular hypotension/desaturation (1 RCT, N = 228, RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.12 to 67.98,  low‐quality evidence ) than haloperidol. There was no suggestion that use of droperidol was unsafe. For mental state, there was no evidence of clear difference between the efficacy of droperidol compared to haloperidol (Scale for Quantification of Psychotic Symptom Severity, 1 RCT, N = 40, mean difference (MD) 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.29,  low‐quality evidence ). There were no data for service use and costs. Whereas, when droperidol was compared with midazolam, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by 30 minutes we found droperidol to be less acutely tranquillising than midazolam (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.28,  high‐quality evidence ). As regards the need for additional medication by 60 minutes after initial adequate sedation, we found an effect (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.20,  moderate‐quality evidence ). In terms of adverse effects, we found no statistically significant differences between the two drugs for either airway obstruction (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.55,  low‐quality evidence ) or respiratory hypoxia (1 RCT, N = 153, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.03,  moderate‐quality evidence ) ‐ but use of midazolam did result in three people (out of around 70) needing some sort of airway management with no such events in the droperidol group. There were no data for mental state, service use and costs. Furthermore, when droperidol was compared to olanzapine, for the outcome of tranquillisation or asleep by any time point, we found no clear differences between the older drug (droperidol) and olanzapine (e.g. at 30 minutes"""

Acetylcholine is a chemical found in the brain that has an important role in memory, attention, reason and language. Donepezil a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which is thought to maintain levels of acetylcholine, and is reported to have some benefits for people with AD in the general population. It is important to note that people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the normal population as well as having subtle differences in physiology (e.g. metabolism and heart rate) and may therefore have different requirements from the general population. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of donepezil for people with DS who develop AD. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SCI, SSCI and the NRR were searched up to October 2008. We contacted the manufacturers of donepezil as well as experts in the field, to ask about reports of unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of participants with DS and AD in which treatment with donepezil was administered compared with a placebo group. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted from the published reports of the one relevant study identified. Main results The one study included in this review is a small (n=30) randomised controlled trial lasting 24 weeks. It was followed‐up by an open label study with a crossover design. No significant differences were found on any four validated outcomes including global functioning and three measures of cognitive abilities and behavioural problems. 6 out of 16 carers (37%) of participants on donepezil and 2 out of 15 (13%) on placebo reported improvement. No data were available for day to day skills, institutionalisation, reduction in carers stress or economic outcomes. Half the intervention group and 20% of the placebo group reported adverse events; two participants left because of adverse events. Authors conclusions To date there is only one small randomised controlled study on the effect of donepezil. This shows, at best, a modest, non statistically significant trend in favour of people with Down syndrome and Alzheimers dementia who are able to tolerate donepezil (this drug is currently only dispensed in relatively large doses and is contraindicated for those with cardiac and respiratory problems).This study does not provide good evidence on which to base practice. Findings in an open‐label follow up to this study suggest possible benefit in some individuals. Further, larger randomised controlled studies with longer‐term follow up are required. Plain language summary Donepezil for dementia in people with Down Syndrome Donepezil is a drug which is thought to discourage the breakdown of acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is important to how memory functions. Acetylcholine is lacking in people with Alzheimers disease (AD). The drug donepezil has been reported to have benefits for people with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease who do not have Down syndrome. However, people with DS tend to present with AD at a much younger age than the general population as well as being physically different in terms of size, metabolism and heart rate, and may therefore have different requirements. This review identified one randomised controlled trial of donepezil in people with Down syndrome. This shows, at best, a modest, non statistically significant trend in favour of people with Down syndrome and Alzheimers dementia who are able to tolerate donepezil. The trial was of good quality, but small. It is important to note that people with Down syndrome may often have other conditions which mean that the drug is not suitable for all.

It affects millions of people worldwide and is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the leading causes of disability. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well‐established treatment for severe depression. Intravenous anaesthetic medication is used to minimize subjective unpleasantness and adverse side effects of the induced tonic‐clonic seizure. The influence of different anaesthetic medications on the successful reduction of depressive symptoms and adverse effects is unclear. Objectives This review evaluated the effects of different regimens of intravenous sedatives and hypnotics on anti‐depression efficacy, recovery and seizure duration in depressed adults undergoing ECT. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (from 1966 to 31 December 2012); and EMBASE via Ovid SP (from 1966 to 31 December 2012). We handsearched related journals and applied no language restrictions. We reran the search in Feburary 2017. Four potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ‘Studies awaiting Classification and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials evaluating the effects of different intravenous sedatives and hypnotics for ECT. We excluded studies and trials using placebo or inhalational anaesthetics and studies that used no anaesthetic. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When possible, data were pooled and risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were computed using the Cochrane Review Manager statistical package (RevMan). Main results We included in the review 18 RCTs (599 participants; published between 1994 and 2012). Most of the included trials were at high risk of bias. We analysed the results of studies comparing six different intravenous anaesthetics. Only a few studies comparing propofol with methohexital (four studies) and with thiopental (three studies) could be pooled. No difference was noted in the reduction of depression scores observed in participants treated with propofol compared with methohexital (low‐quality evidence). These four studies were not designed to detect differences in depression scores. The duration of electroencephalograph (EEG) and of motor seizures was shorter in the propofol group compared with the methohexital group (low‐quality evidence). No difference was seen in EEG seizure duration when propofol was compared with thiopental (low‐quality evidence). Time to recovery (following commands) was longer among participants after anaesthesia with thiopental compared with propofol (low‐quality evidence). For the remaining comparisons of anaesthetics, only single studies or insufficient data were available. Adverse events were inadequately reported in eligible trials, and none of the included trials reported anaesthesia‐related mortality. Authors conclusions Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias, and the quality of evidence was generally low. The studies were not designed to detect clinically relevant differences in depression scores. Anaesthetic agents should be chosen on the basis of adverse effect profile, emergence and how these medications affect seizure duration. If it is difficult to elicit an adequately long seizure, methohexital may be superior to propofol (low‐quality evidence). If a patient is slow to recover from anaesthesia, propofol may allow a faster time to follow commands than thiopental (low‐quality evidence). A factor of clinical concern that was not addressed by any study was adrenal suppression from etomidate. Optimal dosages of intravenous sedatives or hypnotics have not yet been determined. Larger well‐designed randomized studies are needed to determine which intravenous anaesthetic medication leads to the greatest improvement in depression scores with minimal adverse effects. Plain language summary Different regimens of intravenous sedatives or hypnotics for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adult patients with depression Depression is a common mental disorder. It can present as loss of interest or pleasure, sadness, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of guilt or low self worth. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that depression was the second leading cause of disability‐adjusted life‐years among all men and women between 15 and 44 years of age. The treatment of choice for severe and recurrent depression is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT involves the application of an electrical current to the patients head. The aim is to induce a controlled convulsion. Patients usually undergo several sessions of ECT. To minimize adverse events and improve the quality of ECT, patients receive anaesthetic agents such as intravenous sedatives or hypnotics. These agents can influence the effectiveness of ECT but can cause potential adverse effects. It would be helpful to identify which is the best anaesthetic agent for ECT in this group of patients. This Cochrane review examined whether different types of anaesthetic agents could have an effect on anti‐depression therapy and reported on the safety of those agents. The evidence is current to December 2012. We included in this review 18 randomized controlled trials (599 participants). We analysed nine pairs of comparisons"""

Research has found that communication skills can impact on a persons recall and understanding of the diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis. People may feel confused and perplexed when information about their illness is not communicated properly. Sharing information about diagnosis of a serious mental illness is particularly challenging. The nature of mental illness is often difficult to explain since there may be no clear aetiology, and the treatment options and prognosis may vary enormously. In addition, newly diagnosed psychiatric patients, who are actively ill, often may not accept their diagnosis due to lack of insight or stigma attached to the condition. There are several interventions that aim to help clinicians to communicate life changing medical diagnoses to people; however, little is known specifically for delivering a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy of different communication strategies used by clinicians to inform people about the diagnosis and outcome of schizophrenia compared with treatment as usual and to compare efficacy between different communication strategies. Search methods On 22 June 2015 and 29 June 2016, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials. We also searched sources of grey literature (e.g., dissertations, theses, clinical reports, evaluations published on websites, clinical guidelines and reports from regulatory agencies). Selection criteria We planned to include all relevant RCTs that included adults with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder. The trials would have investigated the effects of communication strategy or strategies that helped clinicians deliver information specifically about a diagnosis of schizophrenia (which can also include communication regarding the treatment options available and prognosis). Data collection and analysis Review authors independently examined all reports from the searches for any relevant studies. We planned to extract data independently. For binary outcomes, we would have calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we would have estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We would have employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We planned to assess risk of bias for included studies. We created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The searches identified 44 records which appeared to be relevant to the aims of the review. We obtained full reports for seven potential studies; however, after close inspection none of these studies met the inclusion criteria. Authors conclusions Good communication of diagnosis can affect treatment planning, compliance and patient outcomes, especially in the case of conditions such as schizophrenia, which has the potential to cause serious life disruption for both people with schizophrenia and their carers. Currently, there is no evidence based on findings from RCTs assessing the effects of communication strategies for disclosing the diagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders.

They have greater levels of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, diabetes, and respiratory illness. Although genetics may have a role in the physical health problems of these people, lifestyle and environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity play a prominent part. Objectives To review the effects of dietary advice for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (September 09, 2013 and February 24, 2016). Selection criteria We planned to include all randomised clinical trials focusing on dietary advice versus standard care. Data collection and analysis The review authors (RP, KTP) independently screened search results but did not identify any studies that fulﬁlled the review’s criteria. Main results We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Authors conclusions Dietary advice has been shown to improve the dietary intake of the general population. Research is needed to determine whether dietary advice can have a similar benefit in people with serious mental illness. Plain language summary Dietary advice for people with schizophrenia The physical health of people with serious mental illness is often poor. Mortality levels remain about twice those of the general population. They are at greater risk of health problems such as heart disease, respiratory problems, and diabetes. The factors contributing to these health problems include higher levels of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a nutritionally poor intake of food. The aim of this review was to determine whether offering dietary advice to people with schizophrenia would lead to an improvement in their dietary intake and health. We ran a search for trials in 2013 using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups specialised register of trials. We looked for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either dietary advice plus their normal treatment or their normal treatment but without dietary advice. We did not include trials where dietary advice was given in combination with another treatment, for example, with exercise therapy. We were unable to include any trials. Currently there is no good quality evidence available to help people determine if dietary advice is effective for people with schizophrenia. More research is needed."""

De‐escalation is a psychosocial intervention for managing people with disturbed or aggressive behaviour. Secondary management strategies such as rapid tranquillisation, physical intervention and seclusion should only be considered once de‐escalation and other strategies have failed to calm the service user. Objectives To investigate the effects of de‐escalation techniques in the short‐term management of aggression or agitation thought or likely to be due to psychosis. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (latest search 7 April, 2016). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials using de‐escalation techniques for the short‐term management of aggressive or agitated behaviour. We planned to include trials involving adults (at least 18 years) with a potential for aggressive behaviour due to psychosis, from those in a psychiatric setting to those possibly under the influence of alcohol or drugs and/or as part of an acute setting as well. We planned to include trials meeting our inclusion criteria that provided useful data. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors inspected all abstracts of studies identified by the search process. As we were unable to include any studies, we could not perform data extraction and analysis. Main results Of the 345 citations that were identified using the search strategies, we found only one reference to be potentially suitable for further inspection. However, after viewing the full text, it was excluded as it was not a randomised controlled trial. Authors conclusions Using de‐escalation techniques for people with psychosis induced aggression or agitation appears to be accepted as good clinical practice but is not supported by evidence from randomised trials. It is unclear why it has remained such an under‐researched area. Conducting trials in this area could be influenced by funding flow, ethical concerns ‐ justified or not ‐ anticipated pace of recruitment as well the difficulty in accurately quantifying the effects of de‐escalation itself. With supportive funders and ethics committees, imaginative trialists, clinicians and service‐user groups and wide collaboration this dearth of randomised research could be addressed.

It has been proposed that many of those currently treated as inpatients could be cared for in acute psychiatric day hospitals. Objectives To assess the effects of day hospital versus inpatient care for people with acute psychiatric disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We approached trialists to identify unpublished studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of day hospital versus inpatient care, for people with acute psychiatric disorders. Studies were ineligible if a majority of participants were under 18 or over 65, or had a primary diagnosis of substance abuse or organic brain disorder. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted and cross‐checked data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Day hospital trials tend to present similar outcomes in slightly different formats, making it difficult to synthesise data. We therefore sought individual patient data so that we could re‐analyse outcomes in a common format. Main results Ten trials (involving 2685 people) met the inclusion criteria. We obtained individual patient data for four trials (involving 646 people). We found no difference in the number lost to follow‐up by one year between day hospital care and inpatient care (5 RCTs, n = 1694, RR 0.94 CI 0.82 to 1.08). There is moderate evidence that the duration of index admission is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (4 RCTs, n = 1582, WMD 27.47 CI 3.96 to 50.98). There is very low evidence that the duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month) is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (3 RCTs, n = 265, WMD 2.34 days/month CI 1.97 to 2.70). There is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for the being readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge (5 RCTs, n = 667, RR 0.91 CI 0.72 to 1.15). It is likely that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for being unemployed at the end of the study (1 RCT, n = 179, RR 0.88 CI 0.66 to 1.19), for quality of life (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.01 CI ‐0.13 to 0.15) or for treatment satisfaction (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.06 CI ‐0.18 to 0.30). Authors conclusions Caring for people in acute day hospitals is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients. However, further data are still needed on the cost effectiveness of day hospitals. Plain language summary Day hospital versus admission for acute psychiatric disorders Day hospitals are a less restrictive alternative to inpatient admission for people who are acutely and severely mentally ill. This review compares acute day hospital care to inpatient care. We found that at least one in five patients currently admitted to inpatient care could feasibly be cared for in an acute day hospital. Patients treated in the day hospital had the same levels of treatment satisfaction and quality of life as those cared for as inpatients. The day hospital patients were also no more likely to be unemployed at the end of their care."""

The latest NICE guideline for dementia highlights the value of diverse treatment options for the different stages and symptoms of dementia including non‐pharmacological treatments. Relevant literature also argues for the value of interventions that acknowledge the complexity of the condition and address the person as a whole, including their physical, emotional, social and cognitive processes. At the same time, there is growing literature that highlights the capacity of the arts and embodied practices to address this complexity. Dance movement therapy is an embodied psychological intervention that can address complexity and thus, may be useful for people with dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of dance movement therapy on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms of people with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. Also, to compare different forms of dance movement therapy (e.g. Laban‐based dance movement therapy, Chacian dance movement therapy or Authentic Movement). Search methods Searches took place up to March 2016 through ALOIS, Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement’s Specialized Register, which covers CENTRAL, a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers, and grey literature sources. We checked bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, and contacted professional associations, educational programmes and experts from around the world. Selection criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, including cross‐over design and cluster‐RCTs for inclusion. Studies considered had to include people with dementia, in any age group and in any setting, with interventions delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted. Data collection and analysis The two review authors independently reviewed studies on an abstract/title level and again after reading the full paper, and we independently evaluated methodological quality. Main results Of the 102 studies identified through electronic searches and personal communication, after de‐duplication we screened 80 at title/abstract level. We then reviewed 19 full papers, none of which met the inclusion criteria. Although three studies mentioned dance movement therapy as their intervention, they were excluded because they were not delivered by a qualified dance movement therapy practitioner. As a result, no studies were included in this review. Authors conclusions Trials of high methodological quality, large sample sizes and clarity in the way the intervention is put together and delivered are needed to assess whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia. Plain language summary Is dance movement therapy an effective intervention for dementia? A review of the evidence Why is this review important? Dementia currently affects approximately 35.6 million people worldwide and there is an expectation that, as people are growing older, there will be a substantial increase in the number of people affected. Dementia literature argues for the need to address the complexity of the symptoms and work with the person as a whole. It is possible that dance movement therapy, an embodied psychological intervention that uses movement and dance to express and explore emotions, may be useful for people with dementia. However, its effectiveness remains unclear. This is the first review of the effectiveness of dance movement therapy for dementia and will add to the evidence base regarding available non‐pharmacological interventions for dementia. Who might be interested in this review? It is expected that this review will be of interest to people affected by dementia and their carers as well as general practitioners, mental health professionals and psychological therapists. What questions does this review aim to answer? We asked the following questions. Is dance movement therapy more effective than no treatment or standard care? Is dance movement therapy more effective than any other treatment? How effective are different types of dance movement therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We searched databases for all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies of dance movement therapy for dementia up to March 2016, with participants of any age, gender or ethnicity. No study met the inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There was no evidence for or against dance movement therapy as a useful intervention for dementia. What should happen next? Well‐designed studies with a large number of participants and well‐defined interventions are needed before we are clear on whether dance movement therapy is an effective intervention for dementia or not."""

Animal studies suggest that CDP‐choline may protect cell membranes by accelerating resynthesis of phospholipids. CDP‐choline may also attenuate the progression of ischaemic cell damage by suppressing the release of free fatty acids. CDP‐choline is the endogenous compound normally produced by the organism. When the same substance is introduced as a drug it can be called citicoline. CDP‐choline is mainly used in the treatment of disorders of a cerebrovascular nature. The many years of its presence in the clinical field have caused an evolution in dosage, method of administration, and selection criteria of patients to whom the treatments were given. Modalities of the clinical studies, including length of observation, severity of disturbance, and methodology of evaluation of the results were also heterogeneous. In spite of uncertainties about its efficacy due to these complexities, CDP‐choline is a frequently prescribed drug for cognitive impairment in several European countries, especially when the clinical picture is predominantly one of cerebrovascular disease, hence the need for this review. Due to its effects on the adrenergic and dopaminergic activity of the CNS, CDP‐choline has also been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Parkinsons disease. Objectives To assess the efficacy of CDP‐choline (cytidinediphosphocholine) in the treatment of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders in the elderly. Search methods The trials were identified from a last updated search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 22 April 2004 using the terms CDP‐choline, CDP, citicoline, cytidine diphosphate choline or diphosphocholine. The Register contains records from all major health‐care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. Selection criteria All relevant unconfounded, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized trials of CDP‐choline for cognitive impairment due to chronic cerebral disorders were considered for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently reviewed the included studies, extracted the data, and pooled it when appropriate and possible. The pooled odd ratios (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) or the average differences (95% CI) were estimated. No intention‐to‐treat data were available from the studies included. Main results Fourteen studies were included in this review. Some of the included studies did not present numerical data suitable for analysis. Description of participants varied over the years and by type of disorders and severity, and ranged from aged individuals with subjective memory disorders to patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (mild to moderate), Vascular Dementia or Senile Dementia (mild to moderate). Seven of the included studies observed the subjects for a period between 20 to 30 days, one study was of 6 weeks duration, four studies used periods extending over 2 and 3 months, one study observed continuous administration over 3 months and one study was prolonged, with 12 months of observation. The studies were heterogeneous in dose, modalities of administration, inclusion criteria for subjects, and outcome measures. Results were reported for the domains of attention, memory testing, behavioural rating scales, global clinical impression and tolerability. There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of CDP‐choline on attention. There was evidence of benefit of CDP‐choline on memory function and behaviour. The drug was well tolerated. Authors conclusions There was some evidence that CDP‐choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short to medium term. The evidence of benefit from global impression was stronger, but is still limited by the duration of the studies. Further research with CDP‐choline should focus on longer term studies in subjects who have been diagnosed with currently accepted standardised criteria, especially Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (VaMCI) or vascular dementia. Plain language summary Some evidence that CDP‐choline has a positive effect on memory and behaviour in at least the short/medium term in elderly people with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebral disorders of the brain Patients with cognitive deficits associated with chronic cerebrovascular disorders may not respond to anti‐dementia treatments in the same manner as can be observed in cases of Alzheimers dementia. There is some evidence that CDP‐choline provides modest but consistent improvement of memory and behaviour in these patients. These findings, however, are limited by the relatively short‐term of clinical controlled observations which in all studies but one lasted for no more than three months. Subjective evaluations of these patients as given by their doctors were consistently positive and no noticeable side effects were evidenced in the various studies over the years."""

Considerable research and clinical efforts have been directed toward finding disease‐modifying interventions that may prevent or delay progression from MCI to clinical dementia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of at least 12 weeks of computerised cognitive training (CCT) on maintaining or improving cognitive function and preventing dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched to 31 May 2018 in ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ) and ran additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO portal/ICTRP ( www.apps.who.int/trialsearch ) to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in which cognitive training via interactive computerised technology was compared with an active or inactive control intervention. Experimental computerised cognitive training (CCT) interventions had to adhere to the following criteria"

Low cognitive and brain reserve and limited cognitive stimulation are associated with increased risk of dementia. Emerging evidence now suggests that subtle cognitive changes, detectable years before criteria for mild cognitive impairment are met, may be predictive of future dementia. Important for intervention and reduction in disease risk, research also suggests that engaging in stimulating mental activity throughout adulthood builds cognitive and brain reserve and reduces dementia risk. Therefore, midlife (defined here as 40 to 65 years) may be a suitable time to introduce cognitive interventions for maintaining cognitive function and, in the longer term, possibly preventing or delaying the onset of clinical dementia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks for maintaining or improving cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in midlife.

Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and is intended to maintain optimum cognitive function.

Antipsychotic drugs does reduce these symptoms, but at least half of people given these drugs do not comply with the treatment regimen prescribed. Objectives To assess the effects of compliance therapy on antipsychotic medication adherence for people with schizophrenia. Search methods Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2005). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials of compliance therapy for people with schizophrenia or related severe mental disorders. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and, for dichotomous data, calculated the relative risk (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention to treat basis. We present continuous data using the weighted mean difference statistic. Main results We included one trial with relevant and available data (n=56, duration 2 years) comparing compliance therapy with non‐specific counseling. The primary outcome non‐compliance with treatment showed no significant difference between compliance therapy and non‐specific counseling (n=56, RR 1.23 CI 0.74 to 2.05). The compliance therapy did not substantially effect attitudes to treatment (n=50, WMD DAI score ‐2.10 CI ‐6.11 to 1.91). Very few people (˜10%) left the study by one year (n=56, RR 0.5 CI 0.1 to 2.51).

At both one and two years the average number of days in hospital was non‐significantly reduced for those allocated to the compliance therapy. Authors conclusions There is no clear evidence to suggest that compliance therapy is beneficial for people with schizophrenia and related syndromes but more randomised studies are justified and needed in order for this intervention to be fully examined. Plain language summary Compliance therapy for schizophrenia Relapse in people with schizophrenia is common and in many cases attributable to poor compliance with antipsychotic medication. Compliance therapy was developed to specifically address non‐compliance with antipsychotic medication. We only found one reasonably good but small trial. It did not show that compliance therapy really effected compliance with medication, psychotic symptoms, or quality of life but it was always too small really to show this for certain. The study did, however, suggest that the compliance therapy may help people spend shorter times in hospital across a two year period, when compared with standard care. There is a need for more studies and we have proposed a design that could be conducted within the confines of routine care for outcomes of interest to everyone involved."""

Persistent forms of depression represent a substantial proportion of depressive disorders, with a lifetime prevalence ranging from 3% to 6% in the Western world. Growing evidence indicates that PDD responds well to several acute interventions, such as combined psychological and pharmacological treatments. Yet, given the high rates of relapse and recurrences of depression following response to acute treatment, long‐term continuation and maintenance therapy are of great importance. To date, there has been no evidence synthesis available on continuation and maintenance treatments of PDDs. Objectives To assess the effects of pharmacological and psychological (either alone or combined) continuation and maintenance treatments for persistent depressive disorder, in comparison with each other, placebo (drug/attention placebo/non‐specific treatment control), and treatment as usual (TAU). Continuation treatments are defined as treatments given to currently remitted people (remission is defined as depressive symptoms dropping below case level) or to people who previously responded to an antidepressant treatment. Maintenance therapy is given during recovery (which is defined as remission lasting longer than six months). Search methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐ ), Embase (1974‐ ), PsycINFO (1967‐ ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 28 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was also conducted for RCTs via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD‐CTR) (all years to 11 Dec 2015). In addition we searched grey literature resources as well as the international trial registers  ClinicalTrials.gov  and  ICTRP  to 28 September 2018. We screened reference lists of included studies and contacted the first author of all included studies. Selection criteria We included randomized (RCTs) and non‐randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) in adults with formally diagnosed PDD, receiving pharmacological, psychological, or combined continuation and maintenance interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted and analyzed data. The primary efficacy outcome was relapse/recurrence rate of depression. The primary acceptance outcome was dropout due to any reason other than relapse/recurrence. We performed random‐effects meta‐analyses using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included 10 studies (seven RCTs, three NRCTs) involving 840 participants in this review, from which five studies investigated continuation treatments and five studies investigated maintenance treatments. Overall, the included studies were at low‐to‐moderate risk of bias. For the three NRCTs, the most common source of risk of bias was selection of reported results. For the seven RCTs, the most common sources of risk of bias was non‐blinding of outcome assessment and other bias (especially conflict of interest due to pharmaceutical sponsoring). Pharmacological continuation and maintenance therapies The most common comparison was antidepressant medication versus tablet placebo (five studies). Participants taking antidepressant medication were probably less likely to relapse or to experience a recurrent episode compared to participants in the placebo group at the end of the intervention (13.9% versus 33.8%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; participants = 383; studies = 4; I² = 54%, moderate quality evidence). Overall dropout rates may be similar between participants in the medication and placebo group (23.0% versus 25.5%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.11; RCTs = 4; participants = 386; I² = 64%, low quality evidence). However, sensitivity analyses showed that the primary outcome (rate of relapse/recurrence) showed no evidence of a difference between groups when only including studies with low risk of bias. None of the studies compared pharmacological or psychological treatments versus TAU. Psychological continuation and maintenance therapies One study compared psychological therapies versus attention placebo/non‐specific control. One study compared psychotherapy with medication. The results of the studies including psychotherapy might indicate that continued or maintained psychotherapy could be a useful intervention compared to no treatment or antidepressant medication. However, the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Combined psychological and pharmacological continuation and maintenance therapies Three studies compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with pharmacological therapies alone. One study compared combined psychological and pharmacological therapies with psychotherapeutic therapies alone. However, the body of evidence for these comparisons was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions Comparison of different antidepressant medications Two studies reported data on the direct comparison of two antidepressants. However, the body of evidence for this comparison was too small and uncertain to draw any high quality conclusions. Authors conclusions Currently, it is uncertain whether continued or maintained pharmacotherapy (or both) with the reviewed antidepressant agents is a robust treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence in people with PDD, due to moderate or high risk of bias as well as clinical heterogeneity in the analyzed studies. For all other comparisons, the body of evidence was too small to draw any final conclusions, although continued or maintained psychotherapy might be effective compared to no treatment. There is need for more high quality trials of psychological interventions. Further studies should address health‐related quality of life and adverse events more precisely, as well as assessing follow‐up data. Plain language summary Long‐term treatment for people with persistent depression Why is this review important? Depressive disorders that persist for at least two years cause considerable problems. Even after successful treatment, they frequently recur. Common treatments are antidepressant medicines and psychological treatments (talking therapies), or a combination of both. Long‐term treatments should prevent the recurrence of depressive symptoms. Who will be interested in this review? ‐ People with persisting depression (longer than two years), friends, families, and carers. ‐ General practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists. What questions does this review aim to answer? In adults with persistent depression who improved with acute (short‐term) treatment"""

Effective use of communication skills in mental health interactions could be associated with increased patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment. Objectives To review the effectiveness of communication skills training for mental health professionals who work with people with severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Trials Register (latest search 17 February, 2016) which is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. Selection criteria All relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that focused on communication skills training (CST) for mental health professionals who work with people with severe mental illness compared with those who received standard or no training. We sought a number of primary (patient adherence to treatment and attendance at scheduled appointments as well as mental health professionals satisfaction with the training programme) and secondary outcomes (patients global state, service use, mental state, patient satisfaction, social functioning, quality of life). RCTs where the unit of randomisation was by cluster (e.g. healthcare facility) were also eligible for inclusion. We included one trial that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. Data collection and analysis We independently selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we planned to calculate standard estimates of the risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups, or obtain the adjusted mean difference (aMD) where available for cluster‐randomised trials. If heterogeneity had been identified, we would have explored this using a random‐effects model. We used GRADE to create a Summary of findings table and we assessed risk of bias for the one included study. Main results We included one pilot cluster‐RCT that recruited a total of 21 psychiatrists and 97 patients. The psychiatrists were randomised to a training programme in communication skills, compared to a no specific training (NST) programme. The trial provided useable data for only one of our prestated outcomes of interest, patient satisfaction. The trial did not report global state but did report mental state and, as global state data were not available, we included these mental state data in the Summary of findings table. There was high risk of bias from attrition because of substantial losses to follow‐up and incomplete outcome data. Patient satisfaction was measured as satisfaction with treatment and experience of therapeutic relationship at medium term (five months). Satisfaction with treatment was similar between the CST and NST group using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‐8) (1 RCT, n = 66/97*, aMD 1.77 95% CI ‐ 0.13 to 3.68,  low‐quality evidence ). When comparing patient experience of the therapeutic relationship using the STAR‐P scale, participants in the CST group rated the therapeutic relationship more positively than participants in the NST group (1 RCT, n = 63/97, aMD 0.21 95% CI 0.01 to 0.41,  low‐quality evidence ). Mental state scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were similar between treatment groups for general symptoms (1 RCT, n = 59/97, aMD 4.48 95% CI ‐2.10 to 11.06,  low‐quality evidence ), positive symptoms (1 RCT, n = 59/97, aMD ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐2.91 to 2.45,  low‐quality evidence ) and negative symptoms (1 RCT, n = 59/97, aMD 3.42, 95%C CI ‐0.24 to 7.09,  low‐quality evidence ). No data were available for adherence to treatment, service use or quality of life. * Of the total of 97 randomised participants, 66 provided data. Authors conclusions The evidence available is from one pilot cluster‐randomised controlled trial, it is not adequate enough to draw any robust conclusions. There were relatively few good quality data and the trial is too small to highlight differences in most outcome measures. Adding a CST programme appears to have a modest positive effect on patients experiences of the therapeutic relationship. More high‐quality research is needed in this area. Plain language summary Communication skills training for mental health professionals working with people with severe mental illness Question Does communication skills training for mental health professionals benefit their patients with severe mental illness? Background Severe mental illness (such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) is a mental, behavioural or emotional disorder which severely interferes with, or limits a person’s life activities for a prolonged time (e.g. from a few months to a few years). People with severe mental health problems do not always follow their treatment plans. Effective communication between health professionals and their patients is an essential part of ensuring that vital information about treatment options and maintaining contact with services is understood and followed to by the patient. For patients with severe mental health problems, and their carers, this interaction can be challenging. There are many negative outcomes for patients with severe mental health problems who experience ineffective communication with health professionals, which include alienation, increase of symptoms and possible compulsory hospitalisation. It is thought that when effective communication skills are used by mental health professionals, their patients are more satisfied and adhere to their treatment plans. Moreover, professional‐patient rapport is a necessary part of giving the patient the confidence to be pro‐active in their treatment regimens. However, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to guide practice in this area for people with severe mental illness. Searches We ran a search for RCTs using Cochrane Schizophrenias register of trials, latest search date was in February 2016. Only five possible studies were found and from these only one pilot study could be included. It measured the effect on patients of communication skills training for psychiatrists ability to identify and clarify misunderstandings during communication with patients. Results We were interested in the effect communication skills training had on patient adherence to treatment, satisfaction, mental state, service use and quality of life. We could only use data reported for the patients satisfaction with the treatment, with the therapeutic relationship and mental state (psychiatric symptoms). Five months after treatment, patients who were treated by psychiatrists who received communication training had a modest increase in satisfaction with the therapeutic relationship compared with patients treated by psychiatrists who did not receive the training. Satisfaction with treatment and mental state of the patient were similar between the two treatment groups. Conclusions These results are based on low‐quality evidence are not conclusive; the available evidence is from one small pilot trial, which is not adequate enough to draw any meaningful conclusions. Much more high‐quality research is needed in this area."""

Objectives To review evidence concerning short‐ and long‐term advantages and disadvantages of combined psychotherapy plus antidepressant treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with either therapy alone. Search methods The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Registers (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) were searched on 11/10/2005, together with a complementary search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, using the keywords antidepressant and panic. A reference search, SciSearch and personal contact with experts were carried out. Selection criteria Two independent review authors identified randomised controlled trials comparing the combined therapy against either of the monotherapies among adult patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors extracted data using predefined data formats, including study quality indicators. The primary outcome was relative risk (RR) of ""response"" i.e. substantial overall improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators. Secondary outcomes included standardised weighted mean differences in global severity, panic attack frequency, phobic avoidance, general anxiety, depression and social functioning and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Main results We identified 23 randomised comparisons (representing 21 trials, 1709 patients), 21 of which involved behaviour or cognitive‐behaviour therapies. In the acute phase treatment, the combined therapy was superior to antidepressant pharmacotherapy (RR 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.52) or psychotherapy (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31). The combined therapy produced more dropouts due to side effects than psychotherapy (number needed to harm (NNH) around 26). After the acute phase treatment, as long as the drug was continued, the superiority of the combination over either monotherapy appeared to persist. After termination of the acute phase and continuation treatment, the combined therapy was more effective than pharmacotherapy alone (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.11) and was as effective as psychotherapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16). Authors\ conclusions Either combined therapy or psychotherapy alone may be chosen as first line treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, depending on patient preference. Plain language summary Psychotherapy combined with antidepressants for panic disorder Psychotherapy plus antidepressant treatment were compared with each of the two individual treatments alone for panic disorder. At the end of the acute phase treatment, the combined therapy was superior to psychotherapy or antidepressant treatment alone. After termination of active treatment, the combined therapy was superior to antidepressants alone and was as effective as psychotherapy alone.

We used a large number of measures and data to evaluate 19 outcomes at end of treatment, as well as 16 outcomes at follow‐up in the medium term; we pooled this information in meta‐analyses. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment effect using a random‐effects model, and we estimated statistical heterogeneity using a standard Chi² statistic. We graded the evidence using GradePro. Main results The 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel‐group, single‐site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as straight CT, but we classified some as augmented CT, and about two‐thirds as multi‐domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others. The methodological quality of studies varied, but we rated nearly all studies as having high or unclear risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment, and high or unclear risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. We used data from 32 studies in the meta‐analysis of at least one outcome. Relative to a control condition, we found moderate‐quality evidence showing a small to moderate effect of CT on our first primary outcome, composite measure of global cognition at end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.62), and high‐quality evidence showing a moderate effect on the secondary outcome of verbal semantic fluency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81) at end of treatment, with these gains retained in the medium term (3 to 12 months post treatment). In relation to many other outcomes, including our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term, the quality of evidence was very low, so we were unable to determine whether CT was associated with any meaningful gains. When compared with an alternative treatment, we found that CT may have little to no effect on our first primary outcome of global cognition at end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 0.64), but the quality of evidence was low. No evidence was available to assess our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term. We found moderate‐quality evidence showing that CT was associated with improved mood of the caregiver at end of treatment, but this was based on a single trial. The quality of evidence in relation to many other outcomes at end of treatment and in the medium term was too low for us to determine whether CT was associated with any gains, but we are moderately confident that CT did not lead to any gains in mood, behavioural and psychological symptoms, or capacity to perform activities of daily living. Authors conclusions Relative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well‐established risks of bias, and should provide long‐term follow‐up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained. Future trials should also focus on direct comparison of CT versus alternative treatments rather than passive or active control conditions. Plain language summary Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia Background Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. Main findings We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. Limitations of this review The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term."""

The perceived impact of cognitive impairment on day‐to‐day functioning has led to the development of cognitive rehabilitation techniques intended to remedy these impairments, and thus improve the functioning of people with schizophrenia. Objectives To determine whether the use of cognitive rehabilitation techniques is associated with improvement in people with schizophrenia and related conditions. Search methods Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982‐1997), the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register of trials (2000), EMBASE (1980‐1997), LILACS (1982‐1997), MEDLINE (1966‐1997), PsycLIT (1974‐1997) and SCISEARCH (1997) were undertaken. References of all identified studies were handsearched and the first author of each included trial was contacted. Selection criteria The reviewers included randomised trials investigating the impact of cognitive rehabilitation on people with schizophrenia, or related conditions, compared to a placebo intervention, another intervention or standard treatment. This version of the review does not include comparisons of different types of cognitive rehabilitation. Data collection and analysis Relevant studies were identified and data extracted reliably by two reviewers working independently. In studies which did not specify the reasons for participants dropping out, we assumed that those who had dropped out had experienced no change in the outcome measures. Where possible, Peto odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Three small studies met the inclusion criteria. Two compared cognitive rehabilitation to a placebo intervention (total n=84), and the other to occupational therapy (n=33). Although cognitive rehabilitation was as acceptable as placebo and occupational therapy, with low attrition in both groups, no effects were demonstrated on measures of mental state, social behaviour, or cognitive functioning. An effect, in favour of cognitive rehabilitation, on a measure of self‐esteem (Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Scale, MD 6.3 CI 1.07‐11.53 ) is worthy of replication in any future trials. Authors conclusions Data are inconclusive and provide no evidence for or against cognitive rehabilitation as a treatment for schizophrenia.

They are essential for goal‐oriented behaviour and responding to new and novel situations. A high number of people with acquired brain injury, including around 75% of stroke survivors, will experience executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction reduces capacity to regain independence in activities of daily living (ADL), particularly when alternative movement strategies are necessary to compensate for limb weakness. Improving executive function may lead to increased independence with ADL. There are various cognitive rehabilitation strategies for training executive function used within clinical practice and it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these interventions. Objectives To determine the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on executive dysfunction for adults with stroke or other non‐progressive acquired brain injuries. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , August 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012), EMBASE (1980 to August 2012), CINAHL (1982 to August 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to August 2012), AMED (1985 to August 2012) and 11 additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts. Selection criteria We included randomised trials in adults after non‐progressive acquired brain injury, where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving cognition including separable executive function data (restorative interventions), where the intervention was aimed at training participants in methods to compensate for lost executive function (compensative interventions) or where the intervention involved the training in the use of an adaptive technique for improving independence with ADL (adaptive interventions). The primary outcome was global executive function and the secondary outcomes were specific components of executive function, working memory, ADL, extended ADL, quality of life and participation in vocational activities. We included studies in which the comparison intervention was no treatment, a placebo intervention (i.e. a rehabilitation intervention that should not impact on executive function), standard care or another cognitive rehabilitation intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, method of dealing with missing data and other potential sources of bias. Main results Nineteen studies (907 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. We included 13 studies (770 participants) in meta‐analyses (417 traumatic brain injury, 304 stroke, 49 other acquired brain injury) reducing to 660 participants once non‐included intervention groups were removed from three and four group studies. We were unable to obtain data from the remaining six studies. Three studies (134 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with sensorimotor therapy. None reported our primary outcome; data from one study was available relating to secondary outcomes including concept formation and ADL. Six studies (333 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with no treatment or placebo. None reported our primary outcome; data from four studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation on secondary outcomes. Ten studies (448 participants) compared two different cognitive rehabilitation approaches. Two studies (82 participants) reported the primary outcome; no statistically significant effect was found. Data from eight studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect on the secondary outcomes. We explored the effect of restorative interventions (10 studies, 468 participants) and compensative interventions (four studies, 128 participants) and found no statistically significant effect compared with other interventions. Authors conclusions We identified insufficient high‐quality evidence to reach any generalised conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on executive function, or other secondary outcome measures. Further high‐quality research comparing cognitive rehabilitation with no intervention, placebo or sensorimotor interventions is recommended. Plain language summary Cognitive rehabilitation for executive function problems after brain injury Executive function is the term used to describe the brain processes that we use to organise ourselves and solve problems. Executive function is frequently affected when the brain is damaged through trauma or from an internal cause such as a stroke. It has been estimated that around 75% of people will have executive function difficulties after a stroke. People with executive function difficulties (executive dysfunction) often find it difficult to learn new ways of doing daily activities, such as dressing themselves. This can make it very difficult for them to learn ways to deal with other problems, such as movement difficulties, which also occur as a result of their brain injury. Cognitive rehabilitation is a type of therapy that aims to improve peoples attention, memory or executive function. If it is possible to improve executive function, then more people with brain injury might become more independent with activities of daily living, and might respond better to their rehabilitation. We investigated how effective cognitive rehabilitation interventions are at improving executive function after brain injury. We found 19 relevant studies involving 907 people. We were able to combine the results of 13 of these studies including 660 participants (395 traumatic brain injury, 234 stroke, 31 other acquired brain injury). Only two of the studies (82 people) reported the outcome in which we were most interested (a general measure of executive function). We found no evidence that cognitive rehabilitation interventions were helpful for people with executive dysfunction for any other outcomes. We recommend that more research is carried out to determine whether cognitive rehabilitation can improve executive function after stroke and brain injury."""

CBT is now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an add‐on treatment for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Selection criteria We selected all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) involving people diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, which compared adding CBT to standard care with standard care given alone. Outcomes of interest included relapse, rehospitalisation, mental state, adverse events, social functioning, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.We included studies fulfilling the predefined inclusion criteria and reporting useable data.

Main results This review now includes 60 trials with 5,992 participants, all comparing CBT added to standard care with standard care alone. Results for the main outcomes of interest (all long term) showed no clear difference between CBT and standard care for relapse (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00; participants = 1538; studies = 13, low‐quality evidence). Two trials reported global state improvement. More participants in the CBT groups showed clinically important improvement in global state (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.84; participants = 82; studies = 2 , very low‐quality evidence). Five trials reported mental state improvement. No differences in mental state improvement were observed (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.02; participants = 501; studies = 5, very low‐quality evidence). In terms of safety, adding CBT to standard care may reduce the risk of having an adverse event (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.72; participants = 146; studies = 2, very low‐quality evidence) but appears to have no effect on long‐term social functioning (MD 0.56, 95% CI ‐2.64 to 3.76; participants = 295; studies = 2, very low‐quality evidence, nor on long‐term quality of life (MD ‐3.60, 95% CI ‐11.32 to 4.12; participants = 71; study = 1, very low‐quality evidence). It also has no effect on long‐term satisfaction with treatment (measured as leaving the study early) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.12; participants = 1945; studies = 19, moderate‐quality evidence). Authors conclusions Relative to standard care alone, adding CBT to standard care appears to have no effect on long‐term risk of relapse. A very small proportion of the available evidence indicated CBT plus standard care may improve long term global state and may reduce the risk of adverse events. Whether adding CBT to standard care leads to clinically important improvement in patients long‐term mental state, quality of life, and social function remains unclear. Satisfaction with care (measured as number of people leaving the study early) was no higher for participants receiving CBT compared to participants receiving standard care. It should be noted that although much research has been carried out in this area, the quality of evidence available is poor ‐ mostly low or very low quality and we still cannot make firm conclusions until more high quality data are available. Plain language summary Is Cognitive behavioural therapy as effective as standard care for people with schizophrenia Background People with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can experience severe disturbances in their thought processes, which may lead to delusions (beliefs that are not based on reality) and hallucinations (seeing and hearing things that are not really there). The mainstay (provides most support for the condition) treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, but these medications are not always successful on their own and additional treatments such as psychosocial therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) are recommended for people with schizophrenia. CBT aims to help people re‐evaluate their views of their symptoms. This process is thought to help reduce distress and change behaviours. It is often used to help people with illnesses such as anxiety and depression. However, CBT is expensive and the evidence for its effectiveness is not clear, particularly for people with schizophrenia. Searches The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched the specialised register for trials that allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either CBT or standard care (the care the participant would normally receive for their condition, in the area the trial was conducted), up to March 2017. These searches found 1730 records. The review authors inspected and screened these records. Main results After screening search results we were able to include 60 trials with 5992 participants. These studies randomly allocated people with schizophrenia to receive either CBT as an add‐on treatment to their standard care or standard care alone. The quality of evidence for our main outcomes of interest was mainly very low, or at best, low. Results showed that adding CBT to standard care did not appear to affect the long‐term risk of relapse. Only two trials (82 participants) provided useful data for long‐term global state; these data showed CBT could be better for long‐term improvement in global state than standard care alone. Adding CBT to standard care may reduce the risk of adverse events but appears to have no advantage over standard care for improving long‐term mental state. Whether adding CBT to standard care improves patient quality of life or social function also remains unclear. Conclusions Currently, the evidence available is unclear and not robust enough to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of adding CBT to standard care for people with schizophrenia compared to standard care alone."""

Objectives To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait‐list controls; (b) active non‐CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long‐term effects of CBT. Search methods Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－ The Cochrane Library  (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  (DSM) or the  International Classification of Diseases  (ICD) for an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism. Data collection and analysis The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random‐effects model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child’s anxiety symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Main results Forty‐one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.34, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.05, I² = 30%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 3.0 (95% CI 1.75 to 3.03). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than non‐CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow‐up studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically significant. Authors conclusions Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication at follow‐up, is limited and inconclusive. Plain language summary Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people Why is this review important? Many children and young people suffer from anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety are more likely to have difficulty with friendships, family life and school. Treatments for children and young people with anxiety can help to prevent them from developing mental health problems or drug and alcohol misuse in later life. Talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to deal with anxiety by using new ways of thinking. Many parents and children prefer to try talking therapies rather than medication such as antidepressants. Who will be interested in this review? Parents, children and young people; people working in education; professionals working in mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. What questions does this review aim to answer? This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2005, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety.

There is some evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis (CBTp) might be an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Main results We found only seven studies which used a brief version of CBTp, but no study compared brief CBTp with CBTp of standard duration. No studies could be included. Authors conclusions Currently there is no literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. We cannot, therefore, conclude whether brief CBTp is as effective, less effective or even more effective than standard courses of the same therapy. This lack of evidence for brief CBTp has serious implications for research and practice. Well planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated. Plain language summary Brief versus standard cognitive behavioural therapy for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). Characteristics of the illness are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions. People with schizophrenia may also find it difficult to find employment, make friends and socialise with other people. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works by focusing on people’s thoughts, emotions and behaviours and by challenging strange or dysfunctional thoughts. CBT was originally developed to help people with psychological disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. More recently it has been used to help people with psychosis (CBTp). Working with a therapist, people establish links between their thoughts, feelings or actions. They are encouraged to re‐evaluate their beliefs, perceptions and reasoning as well as to monitor their own thoughts, feelings, behaviours and symptoms. CBTp is suggested to provide alternative ways of coping with strange thoughts and the symptoms of schizophrenia, which should reduce distress and improve people’s functioning. Standard CBTp tends to involve around 16 sessions (12 to 20 sessions) over 4 to 6 months, while brief CBTp involves around 6 to 10 sessions, in less than 4 months. The aim of this review was to compare two types of CBTp, brief CBTp and standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. A search was run for relevant randomised studies in 2013. Only seven potentially‐relevant studies were found. However, although all of them randomised people with schizophrenia, none of these studies compared brief CBTp with standard CBTp. In the main they compared brief CBTp with standard care or other therapies. There is, therefore, no information or literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for schizophrenia and psychosis. There is a need for large scale research and trials that compare brief CBTp with standard CBTp. This research needs to evaluate costs, have clear definitions of standard and brief CBTp and focus on the time period or number of sessions, i.e. the ‘effective dose’ of CBTp.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may help to alleviate the symptoms of CFS. Objectives To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of CBT for CFS, alone and in combination with other interventions, compared with usual care and other interventions. Search methods CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References were searched on 28/3/2008. We conducted supplementary searches of other bibliographic databases. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, assigned to a CBT condition compared with usual care or another intervention, alone or in combination. Data collection and analysis Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and risk of bias was assessed for each study. The primary outcome was reduction in fatigue severity, based on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), or a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post‐treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT (SMD ‐0.39, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.19), with 40% of CBT participants (four studies, 371 participants) showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76). Findings at follow‐up were inconsistent. For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post‐treatment favoured CBT (SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.65 to ‐0.20). Findings at follow‐up were heterogeneous and inconsistent. Only two studies compared CBT against other interventions and one study compared CBT in combination with other interventions against usual care. Authors conclusions CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue at post‐treatment compared with usual care, and may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared with other psychological therapies. The evidence base at follow‐up is limited to a small group of studies with inconsistent findings. There is a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments, and further studies are required to inform the development of effective treatment programmes for people with CFS. Plain language summary Cognitive behaviour therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a very common and disabling condition, in which people suffer from persistent symptoms of fatigue that are unexplained. Cognitive behaviour therapy is a psychological therapy model that is commonly used to treat a range of psychological and chronic pain conditions. This review aimed to find out whether CBT is effective for CBT, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with other treatments, and whether it is more effective than other treatments used for CFS. The review included 15 studies, with a total of 1043 CFS participants. The review showed that people attending for CBT were more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than people who received usual care or were on a waiting list for therapy, with 40% of people in the CBT group showing clinical improvement, in contrast with 26% in usual care. At follow‐up, 1‐7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. Physical functioning, depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms were also more reduced when compared with other psychological therapies. However at follow‐up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Very few studies reported on the acceptability of CBT and no studies examined side effects. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches."""

Due to the differences among cognitive training interventions reported in the literature, giving a general overview of the current literature remains difficult. Objectives To systematically review the literature and summarize the effect of cognitive training interventions on various domains of cognitive function (ie memory, executive function, attention and speed) in healthy older people and in people with mild cognitive impairment. Search methods The CDCIG Specialized Register was searched on 30 September 2007 for all years up to December 2005.  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched separately on 30 September 2007 to find trials with healthy people. These results were supplemented by searches from January 1970 to September 2007 in PsychInfo/Psyndex, ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed. Selection criteria RCTs of interventions evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive training for healthy older people and people with mild cognitive impairment from 1970 to 2007 that met inclusion criteria were selected. Data collection and analysis Authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Meta‐analysis was performed when appropriate. Main results Only data on memory training could be pooled for analysis. Within this domain, training interventions were grouped according to several outcome variables. Results showed that for  healthy older adults , immediate and delayed verbal recall improved significantly through training compared to a no‐treatment control condition. We did not find any specific memory training effects though as the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in the active control condition. For  individuals with mild cognitive impairment , our analyses demonstrate the same pattern. Thus, there is currently little evidence on the effectiveness and specificity of memory interventions for healthy older adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Authors conclusions There is evidence that cognitive interventions do lead to performance gains but none of the effects observed could be attributable specifically to cognitive training, as the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in active control conditions. This does not mean that longer, more intense or different interventions might not be effective, but that those which have been reported thus far have only limited effect. We therefore suggest more standardized study protocols in order to maximize comparability of studies and to maximize the possibility of data pooling ‐ also in other cognitive domains than memory. Plain language summary Effects of memory training in healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive impairment There is an increasing interest in information on the effectiveness of cognitive training interventions to improve memory in normal and mildly cognitively impaired older adults (60 years and older). We analyzed all cognitive interventions between 1970 and 2007 to determine their effectiveness. The results suggest that cognitive interventions do lead to performance improvements and that the size of the effects differs for different kinds of memory skills in healthy older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment. In particular, immediate and delayed verbal recall improved significantly through training compared to a no‐treatment control condition but the improvements observed did not exceed the improvement in the active control conditions."""

Clozapine, however, entails a significant risk of serious blood disorders such as agranulocytosis which could be potentially fatal. Currently there are a number of newer antipsychotics which have been developed with the purpose to find both a better tolerability profile and a superior effectiveness. Objectives To compare the clinical effects of clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics (such as amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone and zotepine) in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (June 2007) and reference lists of all included randomised controlled trials. We also manually searched appropriate journals and conference proceedings relating to clozapine combination strategies and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria All relevant randomised, at least single‐blind trials, comparing clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics, any dose and oral formulations, for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Data collection and analysis We selected trials and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a random‐effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random‐effects model. Main results The review currently includes 27 blinded randomised controlled trials, which involved 3099 participants. Twelve randomised control trials compared clozapine with olanzapine, five with quetiapine, nine with risperidone, one with ziprasidone and two with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (overall 30.1%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Clozapine had a higher attrition rate due to adverse effects than olanzapine (9 RCTs, n=1674, RR 1.60 CI 1.07 to 2.40, NNT 25 CI 15 to 73) and risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 1.88 CI 1.11 to 3.21, NNT 16 CI 9 to 59). Fewer participants in the clozapine groups left the trials early due to inefficacy than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 0.40 CI 0.23 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 7 to 21), suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine.

Clozapine is useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders, particularly when other antipsychotic medications have failed. It improves positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (such as withdrawal and poverty of speech). However, it is unclear what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects. Objectives To compare the efficacy and tolerability of clozapine at different doses and to identify the optimal dose of clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (August 2011 and 8 December 2016). Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding status or language, that compared the effects of clozapine at different doses in people with schizophrenia and related disorders, diagnosed by any criteria. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations from the searches, identified relevant abstracts, obtained full articles of relevant abstracts, and classified trials as included or excluded. We included trials that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created Summary of findings tables using GRADE. Main results We identified five studies that could be included. Each compared the effects of clozapine at very low dose (up to 149 mg/day), low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) and standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day). Four of the five included studies were based on a small number of participants. We rated all the evidence reported for the main outcomes of interest as low or very low quality. No data were available for the main outcomes of global state, service use or quality of life. Very low dose compared to low dose We found no evidence of effect on mental state between low and very low doses of clozapine in terms of average Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale‐Anchored (BPRS‐A) endpoint score (1 RCT, n = 31, MD 3.55, 95% CI −4.50 to 11.60, very low quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups in body mass index (BMI) in the short term (1 RCT, n = 59, MD −0.10, 95% CI −0.95 to 0.75, low‐quality evidence). Very low dose compared to standard dose We found no evidence of effect on mental state between very low doses and standard doses of clozapine in terms of average BPRS‐A endpoint score (1 RCT, n = 31, MD 6.67, 95% CI −2.09 to 15.43, very low quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups in BMI in the short term (1 RCT, n = 58, MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.76 to 0.96, low‐quality evidence) Low dose compared to standard dose We found no evidence of effect on mental state between low doses and standard doses of clozapine in terms of both clinician‐assessed clinical improvement (2 RCTs, n = 141, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.61, medium‐quality evidence) and clinically important response as more than 30% change in BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 176, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10, medium‐quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups in BMI in the short term (1 RCT, n = 57, MD 0.20, 95% CI −0.84 to 1.24, low‐quality evidence). We found some evidence of effect for other adverse effect outcomes; however, the data were again limited. Very low dose compared to low dose There was limited evidence that serum triglycerides were lower at low‐dose clozapine compared to very low dose in the short term (1 RCT, n = 59, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.49). Low dose compared to standard dose Weight gain was lower at very low dose compared to standard dose (1 RCT, n = 27, MD −2.70, 95% CI −5.38 to −0.02). Glucose level one hour after meal was also lower at very lose dose (1 RCT, n = 58, MD −1.60, 95% CI −2.90 to −0.30). Total cholesterol levels were higher at very low compared to standard dose (1 RCT, n = 58, n = 58, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.80). Low dose compared to standard dose There was evidence of fewer adverse effects, measured as lower TESS scores, in the low‐dose group in the short term (2 RCTs, n = 266, MD −3.99, 95% CI −5.75 to −2.24); and in one study there was evidence that the incidence of lethargy (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97), hypersalivation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84), dizziness (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81) and tachycardia (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71) was less at low dose compared to standard dose. Authors conclusions We found no evidence of effect on mental state between standard, low and very low dose regimes, but we did not identify any trials on high or very high doses of clozapine. BMI measurements were similar between groups in the short term, although weight gain was less at very low dose compared to standard dose in one study. There was limited evidence that the incidence of some adverse effects was greater at standard dose compared to lower dose regimes. We found very little useful data and the evidence available is generally of low or very low quality. More studies are needed to validate our findings and report on outcomes such as relapse, remission, social functioning, service utilisation, cost‐effectiveness, satisfaction with care, and quality of life. There is a particular lack of medium‐ or long‐term outcome data, and on dose regimes above the standard rate. Plain language summary Clozapine dose in schizophrenia Background"""

Research suggests that psychotherapy can have a significant and positive impact on children and adolescents with mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders, depression and conduct disorders. Client feedback tools serve as a method of monitoring clients progress and providing feedback from clients to therapists during the therapeutic process. These tools may help to enhance clinicians decision‐making by allowing them to adapt their treatment plans as the therapy progresses, resulting in a reduction of treatment failures. Research has shown that client feedback tools have a positive effect on adults psychotherapy. This review addresses whether feedback tools in child and adolescent therapy could help therapists to better treat their young clients. Objectives To assess the effects of client feedback in psychological therapy on child and adolescent mental health outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR, Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (1946‐), Embase (1974‐) and PsycINFO (1967‐) to 3 April 2018. We did not apply any restriction on date, language or publication status to the search. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared client feedback to no client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed references for inclusion eligibility and extracted outcome, risk of bias and study characteristics data into customised forms. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and calculated their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs), or standardised mean differences (SMDs) if different scales were used to measure the same outcome. We used a random‐effects model for all analyses. Main results We included six published RCTs, conducted in the USA (5 RCTs) and Israel (1 RCT), with 1097 children and adolescents (11 to 18 years old), in the review. We are very uncertain about the effect of client feedback on improvement of symptoms, as reported by youth in the short term because we considered evidence to be of very low‐certainty due to high risk of bias and very serious inconsistency in the effect estimates from the different studies. Similarly, we are very uncertain about the effect of client feedback on treatment acceptability, due to high risk of bias, imprecision in the results, and indirectness of measuring the outcome (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.61; 2 studies, 237 participants; very low‐certainty). Overall, most studies reported and carried out randomisation and allocation concealment adequately. None of the studies were blinded or attempted to blind participants and personnel and were at high risk of performance bias, and only one study had blind outcome assessors. All of the studies were at high or unclear risk of attrition bias mainly due to poor, non‐transparent reporting of participants flow through the studies. Authors conclusions Due to the paucity of high‐quality data and considerable inconsistency in results from different studies, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach any firm conclusions regarding the role of client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents with mental health problems, and further research on this important topic is needed. Future studies should avoid risks of performance, detection and attrition biases, as seen in the studies included in this review. Studies from countries other than the USA are needed, as well as studies including children younger than 10 years. Plain language summary Client feedback in psychological therapy for children and adolescents with mental health problems Why is this review important? Systematic feedback from clients to psychotherapists may improve outcomes of psychological therapy. Typically, client feedback is provided regularly throughout the course of therapy. Clients fill in a questionnaire about how they feel about the therapy and how they are feeling in general. The questionnaire is then scored and reviewed by the therapist. The idea is that the therapist will use the feedback to adjust the therapy process, aiming to improve the client‐therapist and client‐therapy fit and, ultimately, client involvement, treatment response and outcomes. There is empirical evidence for the use of client feedback in adult psychotherapy to improve outcomes and response, but there is limited knowledge about this practice in children and adolescents. This review can provide a better understanding of the current role of client feedback in psychotherapy for children and adolescents, as well as future directions that promote evidence‐based practice in child and adolescent psychotherapy. Who will be interested in this review? Psychotherapists working with children and adolescents, policy makers, children and adolescents with mental health problems, and their caregivers and relatives. What questions does this review aim to answer? Some research suggests that client feedback has a positive impact on outcomes of psychotherapy with adults. We do not know whether client feedback works with children and adolescents. Which studies were included in the review? To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials, where children and adolescents with mental health problems were allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive either psychotherapy with client feedback or standard psychotherapy. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 3 April 2018, and found six (with a total of 1097 children and adolescents) that met our inclusion criteria. What does the evidence from the review tell us? There have been few investigations of client feedback in psychological therapies for children and adolescents with mental health problems. Most of them were carried out in the USA with older children and adolescents (11 to 18 years old). There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of client feedback in psychological therapy for children and adolescents. What should happen next? It cannot be ruled out that client feedback has positive effects on psychotherapy outcomes in children and adolescents. High‐quality studies are needed to provide sufficient evidence. Future studies should also include younger children, and should take place in countries other than the USA."""

Systematic reviews have already highlighted some differences in efficacy between second‐generation antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) introduced in the market, is one of these antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with tricyclics, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and other conventional and non‐conventional antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to February 2012. No language restriction was applied. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field for supplemental data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to citalopram versus any other antidepressants. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), patient acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side‐effects). Main results Thirty‐seven trials compared citalopram with other antidepressants (such as tricyclics, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other antidepressants, either conventional ones, such as mirtazapine, venlafaxine and reboxetine, or non‐conventional, like  hypericum ). Citalopram was shown to be significantly less effective than escitalopram in achieving acute response (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.02), but more effective than paroxetine (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.96) and reboxetine (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91). Significantly fewer patients allocated to citalopram withdrew from trials due to adverse events compared with patients allocated to tricyclics (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and fewer patients allocated to citalopram reported at least one side effect than reboxetine or venlafaxine (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97 and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88, respectively). Authors conclusions Some statistically significant differences between citalopram and other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. Citalopram was more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine and venlafaxine, however, it seemed to be less efficacious than escitalopram. As with most systematic reviews in psychopharmacology, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings. Economic analyses were not reported in the included studies, however, cost effectiveness information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Plain language summary Citalopram versus other antidepressants for depression Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate‐to‐severe major depression. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is the racemic mixture of S‐ and R‐enantiomer. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Thirty‐seven randomised controlled trials (more than 6000 participants) were included in the present review. In terms of efficacy, citalopram was more efficacious than other reference compounds like paroxetine or reboxetine, but worse than escitalopram. In terms of side effects, citalopram was more acceptable than older antidepressants, like tricyclics. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including differences in efficacy and side‐effect profiles."""

Delirium is commonly treated in hospitals or community settings and is often associated with multiple adverse outcomes such as increased cost, morbidity, and even mortality. The first‐line intervention involves a multicomponent non‐pharmacological approach that includes ensuring effective communication and reorientation in addition to providing reassurance or a suitable care environment. There are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of delirium. Clinically, however, various medications are employed to provide symptomatic relief, such as antipsychotic medications and cholinesterase inhibitors, among others. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors for treating people with established delirium in a non‐intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Search methods We searched ALOIS, which is the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Groups Specialised Register, on 26 October 2017. We also cross‐checked the reference lists of included studies to identify any potentially eligible trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished, reported in English or Chinese, which compared cholinesterase inhibitors to placebo or other drugs intended to treat people with established delirium in a non‐ICU setting. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were duration of delirium, severity of delirium, and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were use of rescue medications, persistent cognitive impairment, length of hospitalisation, institutionalisation, mortality, cost of intervention, leaving the study early, and quality of life. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); for continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE to generate a Summary of findings table. Main results We included one study involving 15 participants from the UK. The included participants were diagnosed with delirium based on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) criteria. Eight males and seven females were included, with a mean age of 82.5 years. Seven of the 15 participants had comorbid dementia at baseline. The risk of bias was low in all domains. The study compared rivastigmine with placebo. We did not find any clear differences between the two groups in terms of duration of delirium (MD ‐3.6, 95% CI ‐15.6 to 8.4), adverse events (nausea, RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.29), use of rescue medications (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.1), mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.56), and leaving the study early (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.07 to 11.54). Evidence was not available regarding the severity of delirium, persistent cognitive impairment, length of hospitalisation, cost of intervention, or other predefined secondary outcomes. The quality of evidence is low due to the very small sample size. Authors conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of delirium in non‐ICU settings. No clear benefits or harms associated with cholinesterase inhibitors were observed when compared with placebo due to the lack of data. More trials are required. Plain language summary Cholinesterase inhibitors for people with delirium, not including those in intensive care units Background During a period of illness, people can develop symptoms of confusion and altered consciousness, which is known as delirium. Compared to patients with no delirium, patients with delirium spend a longer time in hospital and are less likely to survive their illness. Treatment of delirium should focus on good care of the underlying illness and strategies such as reorientation of the patient. However, medication‐based treatments are still often used. Medications used for treating the symptoms of dementia (cholinesterase inhibitors) may have a role in treating delirium. Review question We wished to find out if treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitors reduces the severity or duration of delirium. We were also interested in side effects from cholinesterase inhibitors. Delirium is often seen in severe illnesses that require high levels of medical and nursing care, for example in the intensive care unit. In this review we focused on studies of patients who were not in a high‐level care setting. Study characteristics We found one trial from the UK, which included 15 participants with delirium. The average age of the participants was 82.5 years; eight participants were male and seven were female. Seven participants also had a history of dementia. This trial compared rivastigmine (a type of cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia) with an inactive treatment (placebo). Key results The trial did not show any difference in effect between those participants given rivastigmine and those given placebo. The study was conducted and reported appropriately, but the small number of participants limits any conclusions that could be made about rivastigmine as a treatment for delirium."""

Its irreversible pharmacological potency and adverse effects meant that it has been withdrawn in the UK and its role has been superceded by newer compounds. The effects of reserpine are of historical interest although there are some reports of it still being used in highly specialist situations in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is also an old drug but it is still used for treatment of people with schizophrenia. Objectives To investigate the effects of two old medications (reserpine and chlorpromazine) for people with schizophrenia. Reserpine is now rarely used while chlorpromazine remains on the essential list of drugs of the World Health Organization (WHO). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (24 March 2016). Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia that presented useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The review currently includes nine studies with an average 60 participants per study. All of these studies are now over 60 years old, conducted between 1955 and 1962. When chlorpromazine was compared with reserpine for people with schizophrenia, improvement in global state was better at short term for those receiving chlorpromazine (n = 781, 6 RCTs, RR not improved 0.75 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92,  low‐quality evidence ). Short‐term improvement in paranoid distortion was measured using the Multidimensional Scale for Rating Psychiatric Patients (MSRPP).

Objectives To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 May 2012). We also searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo for people with schizophrenia and non‐affective serious/chronic mental illness irrespective of mode of diagnosis. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re‐inspected and quality assessed these. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this. We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow‐up. Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval. We used a fixed‐effect model. Main results We inspected over 1100 electronic records. The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies. The quality of the evidence is very low. We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow‐up (n=512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous. No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous. We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a persons symptoms and functioning (n=1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86). Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early ( n=1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo. There are many adverse effects. Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n=1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a persons chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n=942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n=1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80). Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo. Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n=1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n=165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43). Authors conclusions The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Chlorpromazines global position as a benchmark treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review. Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well‐established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence‐based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia For previous plain language summary please see  Appendix 3 . People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, being an older drug (‘typical’ or first generation) it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in treating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (‘dummy’ treatment or placebo). Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality. There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people’s mental health, symptoms and functioning. However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating. Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation. It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness. Chlorpromazine is low‐cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods. Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents."""

It is listed among the top 10 causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. Antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment. Piperacetazine has been reported to be as clinically effective as chlorpromazine, a well established benchmark antipsychotic, for people with schizophrenia. However, the side effect profiles of these antipsychotics differ and it is important that an evidence base is available comparing the benefits, and potential harms of these two antipsychotics. Objectives To assess the clinical and side effects of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses in comparison with piperacetazine. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (6 June 2015 and 8 October 2018) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for people with schizophrenia, reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created Summary of findings tables using GRADE. Main results We found 12 records referring to six trials. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. We excluded one trial. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor. Only short‐term data were available. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; participants = 208; studies = 2; very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported change scores on the mental state scale Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); no clear difference was observed (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 0.61; participants = 182; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). Chlorpromazine appears no worse or better than piperacetazine regarding adverse effects. In both treatment groups, around 60% of participants experienced some sort of adverse effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33; participants = 74; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence), with approximately 40% of these participants experiencing some parkinsonism‐type movement disorder (RR 0.95, CI 0.61 to 1.49; participants = 106; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence). No clear difference in numbers of participants leaving the study early for any reason was observed (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.56; participants = 256; studies = 4; very low‐quality evidence). No trial reported data for change in negative symptoms or economic costs. Authors conclusions The results of this review show chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy, but data are based on very small numbers of participants and the evidence is very low quality. We can not make firm conclusions based on such data. Currently, should clinicians and people with schizophrenia need to choose between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine they should be aware there is no good quality evidence to base decisions. More high quality research is needed. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus piperacetazine for schizophrenia Review question Is the antipsychotic drug, chlorpromazine, better or worse than the antipsychotic drug, piperacetazine, for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that severely disrupts a persons thought processes and affects around 1% of the general population. Schizophrenia is listed among the top 10 causes of disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have a lower life expectancy and an increased risk of suicide. There are two main types of symptoms, positive and negative. Common positive symptoms include delusions (beliefs that are not based in reality) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real). Negative symptoms include social withdrawal and lack of motivation and poor emotional response. Positive symptoms are usually of short duration and the negative symptoms can be long term. Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of antipsychotic drugs and psychological therapies. Chlorpromazine and piperacetazine are antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia, however, they both can also cause unpleasant side effects. This review aims to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the effectiveness and safety of both of these drugs. Searching for evidence A search for randomised controlled trials that could be relevant to this review was carried out on 6 June 2015, and another search was carried out 8 October 2018. This was achieved by searching the Specialised Register of Cochrane Schizophrenia. The 2015 search found six possible trials and we carefully checked these to see if we could include them in the review. The 2018 search found no new trials. Results Five trials, randomising a total of 343 participants met the review requirements for inclusion. These trials randomly allocated participants to receive either chlorpromazine or piperacetazine. Data were reported for participants global and mental state after treatment, incidence of adverse effects and numbers leaving the trial early. However, we did not find any data concerning service use, functioning of participants or economic costs of these treatments. The overall results showed chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy and side effect profiles. However, these results are based on very low‐quality data. Conclusions The number of included studies and the sample size of participants included in this review is small, and the quality of data very low, so the results of this review are not conclusive and must be used with caution. Further research would be needed before decisions can be made regarding which drug is more effective."""

Objectives To assess the clinical effects of chlorpromazine compared with penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia. Search methods On 31 March 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders. Outcomes of interest were death, service utilisation, global state, mental state, adverse effects and leaving the study early. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting useable data. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The review includes three studies with a total of 130 participants. Short‐term results for hospital admissions showed no clear difference between chlorpromazine and penfluridol (1 RCT, n = 29, RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60,  low‐quality evidence ). No clear difference in the incidence of akathisia was found at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 85, RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.06,  low‐quality evidence ), and similar numbers of participants ‐ nearly half ‐ from each treatment group left the study early (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.77,  low‐quality evidence ). The risk of needing additional antiparkinsonian medication was less in the chlorpromazine group (2 RCTs, n = 74, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95). No useable data reported clinically important change in global or mental state. No data were reported for relapse. No deaths were reported by the trials. Authors conclusions Only three small studies provided data and the quality of reporting and evidence is low. Limited data indicate the efficacy and adverse effects profiles of chlorpromazine and penfluridol are generally similar. Penfluridol, however, may confer advantage by needing to be given only once per week. Firm conclusions are not possible without good‐quality trials, and where these treatments are used, such trials are justified. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for schizophrenia Review question How effective is the antipsychotic chlorpromazine as a treatment for schizophrenia compared to penfluridol? Background Schizophrenia is serious mental disorder where people experience symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, social withdrawal, decreased motivation and poor emotional response. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine and penfluridol are widely used antipsychotics. However, different antipsychotics have different effects, and knowing the individual effects of different antipsychotics and what particular side effects they cause could help with deciding which antipsychotic to prescribe for an individual with schizophrenia. This review compares chlorpromazine with penfluridol and is one of a series of reviews comparing chlorpromazine directly with other antipsychotics. Searching The Information Specialist of Cochrane Schizophrenia searched their trials register in March, 2017 for trials that randomised adults with schizophrenia or related disorders to receive either chlorpromazine or penfluridol. Seven records were found and checked by the review authors Evidence found Only three randomised controlled trials, with a total of 130 participants met the review requirements and provided useable data. The quality of evidence available was low, no real difference was noted between chlorpromazine and penfluridol for hospital admissions, incidence of akathisia or numbers of participants leaving the study early. There were no deaths during the trials. We were unable to use the available data for global and mental state due to poor reporting, and no studies reported relapse data. Conclusions We can not make firm conclusions regarding the comparable effectiveness between chlorpromazine and penfluridol with such poor quality data ‐ but penfluridol only needs to be given once per week ‐ which could help the poor adherence to medication common with schizophrenia. Remarkably, for such old drugs, more trials that report high‐quality data are needed."""

We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created Summary of findings tables using GRADE. Main results We included three studies randomising 161 people with schizophrenia. Data were available for only two of our seven prestated main outcomes. Clinically important improvement in global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups (2 RCTs, n = 120, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47,  very low quality evidence ) and numbers of participants with parkinsonism at eight weeks were similar (2 RCTs, n = 70, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.03,  very low quality evidence ). There were no useable data available for the other key outcomes of clinically important improvement in mental state, readmission due to relapse, satisfaction with treatment, aggressive or violent behaviour, or cost of care. Authors conclusions Chlorpromazine has been the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia for decades, yet available evidence comparing this drug to metiapine fails to provide high‐quality trial based data. However, the need to determine whether metiapine is more or less effective than chlorpromazine seems to be lacking in clinical relevance and future research on this comparison seems unlikely. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine versus metiapine for schizophrenia The aim of this review was to find good quality evidence for comparing the efficacy of chlorpromazine versus metiapine for schizophrenia. Background Schizophrenia is a common disabling and enduring mental illness worldwide. People with schizophrenia often experience positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms such as apathy (lack of interest) and loss of emotion. Antipsychotic medicines have been successful for treating the positive symptoms but the negative symptoms remain difficult to treat and usually do not respond to routine antipsychotics. In addition, antipsychotic medicines often have unpleasant side effects. Chlorpromazine is a widely available and inexpensive antipsychotic introduced in the 1950s and considered the benchmark treatment for schizophrenia worldwide. Initial research indicated that chlorpromazine helped global improvement and was effective at preventing relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). However, some of chlorpromazines side effects, particularly incidence of movement disorders, are reported as severe or debilitating. Metiapine is a relatively newer antipsychotic medicine, reporting to be effective at treating the symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer side effects. However, there is currently no good quality information concerning metiapines effectiveness directly compared to chlorpromazine. Searching for evidence In November 2015, the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group searched their specialised register for relevant clinical trials. The search identified four reports. We inspected these reports and found they referred to three trials, randomising people with schizophrenia to receive chlorpromazine or metiapine. Main results Our review now includes three studies with 161 participants. The studies revealed no real differences between chlorpromazine and metiapine for improvement in global state or incidence of parkinsonism (an umbrella term for symptoms such as tremor (shaking), bradykinesia (slow movement), rigidity (stiffness), and postural instability (difficulty in balancing).

When chlorpromazine was compared with clotiapine the average improvement scores for mental state using the PANSS total was higher in the clotiapine group (1 RCT, N = 31, MD 11.50 95% CI 9.42 to 13.58, very low‐quality evidence). The average change scores on the PANSS negative sub‐scale were similar between treatment groups (1 RCT, N = 21, MD ‐0.97 95% CI ‐2.76 to 0.82, very low‐quality evidence). There was no clear difference in incidence of dyskinesia (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.13 to 71.15, very low‐quality evidence). Similar numbers of participants left the study early from each treatment group (3 RCTs, N = 158, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.24 to 1.88, very low‐quality evidence). Authors conclusions Clinically important changes in global and mental state were not reported. Only one trial reported the average change in overall mental state; results favour clotiapine but these limited data are very difficult to trust due to methodological limitations of the study. The comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine compared to clotiapine on change in global state remains unanswered. Results in this review suggest chlorpromazine and clotiapine cause similar adverse effects, although again, the quality of evidence for this is poor, making firm conclusions difficult. Plain language summary Direct comparison of two antipsychotics (chlorpromazine versus clotiapine) for treating schizophrenia Review question The aim of this review was to find good quality evidence comparing the efficacy of chlorpromazine versus clotiapine for schizophrenia. Background Chlorpromazine is one of the first antipsychotics to successfully alleviate the symptoms of psychosis. It was introduced in the 1950s and is still one of the most commonly used antipsychotics. However, chlorpromazine can cause serious side effects, particularly unpleasant movement disorders, causing many people with schizophrenia to stop taking chlorpromazine. During the past 70 years newer medications have been developed and most clinicians now have a wide choice of drugs for managing schizophrenia, however, none cure, and all cause some sort of side effect. The choice of treatment is still challenging. Clotiapine is a newer antipsychotic drug, found to be effective for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia and also known to be effective for treating people with schizophrenia who are resistant to other medications, however, like chlorpromazine it can cause serious movement disorders. Searching for evidence Cochrane Schizophrenias Information Specialist ran an electronic search in January 2016, searching their specialised register for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The search identified six reports. We inspected these reports and found four trials, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 participants that could be included in the review. Main results The four included trials were poorly conducted and did not report data for clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in overall mental state was reported and participants receiving clotiapine had better improvement scores than those receiving chlorpromazine. However the trials also reported data for improvement in the negative symptoms, no difference between the two treatments was found. Clotiapine did not cause more movement disorders than chlorpromazine, and similar numbers of participants left the trials early. Conclusions There is some very low‐quality evidence that favours clotiapine over chlorpromazine for improving overall mental state. For other outcomes, including adverse effects, there is no evidence of a difference between these two antipsychotics. However these data are very difficult to draw conclusions from, only four small trials provided data and these were poorly conducted. We cannot draw conclusions on the comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine versus clotiapine from such data."""

Chlorpromazine is reliable for its efficacy and one of the most tested first generation antipsychotic drugs. It has been used as a ‘gold standard’ to compare the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Expensive new generation drugs are heavily marketed worldwide as a better treatment for schizophrenia, but this may not be the case and an unnecessary drain on very limited resources. Objectives To compare the effects of chlorpromazine with atypical or second generation antipsychotic drugs, for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register up to 23 September 2013. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorpromazine with any other atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Adults (as defined in each trial) diagnosed with schizophrenia, including schizophreniform, schizoaffective and delusional disorders were included in this review. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently screened the articles identified in the literature search against the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included trials. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we determined the mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results This review includes 71 studies comparing chlorpromazine to olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine. None of the included trials reported any data on economic costs. 1. Chlorpromazine versus olanzapine In the short term, there appeared to be a significantly greater clinical response (as defined in each study) in people receiving olanzapine (3 RCTs, N = 204; RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.99,  low quality evidence ). There was no difference between drugs for relapse (1 RCT, N = 70; RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.86,  very low quality evidence ), nor in average endpoint score using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for mental state (4 RCTs, N = 245; MD 3.21, 95% CI −0.62 to 7.05, very low quality evidence ). There were significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms experienced amongst people receiving chlorpromazine (2 RCTs, N = 298; RR 34.47, 95% CI 4.79 to 248.30, very low quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings using the general quality of life interview (GQOLI) ‐ physical health subscale were more favourable with people receiving olanzapine (1 RCT, N = 61; MD −10.10, 95% CI −13.93 to −6.27,  very low quality evidence ). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (3 RCTs, N = 139; RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.40,  very low quality evidence ). 2. Chlorpromazine versus risperidone In the short term, there appeared to be no difference in clinical response (as defined in each study) between chlorpromazine or risperidone (7 RCTs, N = 475; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.34,  low quality of evidence ), nor in average endpoint score using the BPRS for mental state 4 RCTs, N = 247; MD 0.90, 95% CI −3.49 to 5.28,  very low quality evidence ), or any observed extrapyramidal adverse effects (3 RCTs, N = 235; RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.40, very low quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings using the QOL scale were significantly more favourable with people receiving risperidone (1 RCT, N = 100; MD −14.2, 95% CI −20.50 to −7.90,  very low quality evidence ). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early (one RCT, N = 41; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.11,  very low quality evidence ). 3. Chlorpromazine versus quetiapine In the short term, there appeared to be no difference in clinical response (as defined in each study) between chlorpromazine or quetiapine (28 RCTs, N = 3241; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06,  moderate quality evidence ) nor in average endpoint score using the BPRS for mental state (6 RCTs, N = 548; MD −0.18, 95% CI −1.23 to 0.88 , very low quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings using the GQOL1‐74 scale were significantly more favourable with people receiving quetiapine (1 RCT, N = 59; MD −6.49, 95% CI −11.30 to −1.68,  very low quality evidence ). Significantly more people receiving chlorpromazine experienced extrapyramidal adverse effects (8 RCTs, N = 644; RR 8.03, 95% CI 4.78 to 13.51,  low quality of evidence ). There was no difference between groups for people leaving the studies early in the short term (12 RCTs, N = 1223; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.41, moderate quality evidence ). Authors conclusions Most included trials included inpatients from hospitals in China. Therefore the results of this Cochrane review are more applicable to the Chinese population. Mostincluded trials were short term studies, therefore we cannot comment on the medium and long term use of chlorpromazine compared to atypical antipsychotics. Low qualityy evidence suggests chlorpromazine causes more extrapyramidal adverse effects. However, all studiesused varying dose ranges, and higher doses would be expected to be associated with more adverse events. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine compared with newer atypical antipsychotics People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for people with these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective for treating people with schizophrenia. It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments. However, being an older drug (typical or first generation) it also has serious side effects, including blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. In this Cochrane review we examined the effects of chlorpromazine for treating people with schizophrenia compared with newer antipsychotic drugs. We searched the literature for randomised controlled trials up to 23 September 2013, and included 71 trials. The included studies compared chlorpromazine with three newer antipsychotics"""

Some guidelines do not recommend the use of chlorpromazine for rapid tranquillisation but it is still often used for this purpose. Objectives To examine the effects of oral or intramuscular chlorpromazine for psychosis induced agitation or aggression. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (up to July 2009) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Selection criteria Randomised control trials or double blind trials (implying randomisation) comparing chlorpromazine with another drug or placebo for people who are thought to be acutely aggressive or agitated due to psychotic illness. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed‐effects model. Main results One study (total n=30) met the inclusion criteria. When compared with haloperidol ( Man 1973 ) (1 RCT, n=30) people allocated chlorpromazine were no more likely to have one additional injection than those allocated haloperidol (RR 3.00 CI 0.13 to 68.26). This remained true for 2‐4 injections (RR 0.90 CI 0.52 to 1.55) and for 5 or more injections (RR 0.75 CI 0.20 to 2.79). Two people allocated chlorpromazine had sudden, serious hypotension while no one allocated haloperidol had such an effect (RR 5.00 CI 0.26 to 96.13). No extrapyramidal symptoms were observed. One person allocated chlorpromazine developed status epilepticus (RR 3.00 CI 0.13 to 68.26). Authors conclusions Overall the quality of evidence is limited, poor and dated. Where drugs that have been better evaluated are available, it may be best to avoid use of chlorpromazine. Where chlorpromazine is used for acute aggression or where choices are limited, relevant trials are possible and urgently needed. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine for treating aggression or agitation due to psychosis Chlorpromazine was the first medicine specifically developed to treat psychoses as it helps people to feel less anxious, tense or angry. This review systematically examines the evidence to see how effective chlorpromazine is at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis. From the evidence available, we are unable to draw any firm conclusion about using this medicine for this purpose. We found that chlorpromazine was just as effective at reducing aggression or agitation due to psychosis as similar medicines, but that it may be associated with more side effects than other medicines. Further research is needed to clarify whether chlorpromazine is effective at reducing psychosis induced aggression or agitation. Such research would be best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials."""

Objectives To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose side‐effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials (December 2008; 2 October 2014; 19 December 2016). Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low doses of chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day), medium dose (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or higher doses (> 800 mg/day) for people with schizophrenia, and which reported clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We included studies meeting review criteria and providing useable data. Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs based on a fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and graded trial quality using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Main results As a result of searches undertaken in 2014, we found one new study and in 2016 more data for already included studies. Five relevant studies with 1132 participants (585 are relevant to this review) are now included. All are hospital‐based trials and, despite over 60 years of chlorpromazine use, have durations of less than six months and all are at least at moderate risk of bias. We found only data on low‐dose (≤ 400 mg/day) versus medium‐dose chlorpromazine (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) and low‐dose versus high‐dose chlorpromazine (> 800 mg/day). When low‐dose chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared to medium‐dose chlorpromazine (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day), there was no clear benefit of one dose over the other for both global and mental state outcomes ( low‐quality  and  very low‐quality evidence ). There was also no clear evidence for people in one dosage group being more likely to leave the study early, over the other dosage group ( moderate‐quality evidence ). Similar numbers of participants from each group experienced agitation and restlessness ( very low‐quality evidence ). However, significantly more people in the medium‐dose group (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day) experienced extrapyramidal symptoms in the short term (2 RCTS, n = 108, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74,  moderate‐quality evidence ). No data for death were available. When low‐dose chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared to high‐dose chlorpromazine (> 800 mg/day), data from one study with 416 patients were available. Clear evidence of a benefit of the high dose was found with regards to global state. The low‐dose group had significantly fewer people improving (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25,  moderate‐quality evidence ). There was also a marked difference between the number of people leaving the study from each group for any reason, with significantly more people leaving from the high‐dose group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89,  moderate‐quality evidence ). More people in the low‐dose group had to leave the study due to deterioration in behaviour (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.44,  low‐quality evidence ). There was clear evidence of a greater risk of people experiencing extrapyramidal symptoms in general in the high‐dose group (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.59,  moderate‐quality evidence ). One death was reported in the high‐dose group yet no effect was shown between the two dosage groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14,  moderate‐quality evidence ). No data for mental state were available. Authors conclusions The dosage of chlorpromazine has changed drastically over the past 50 years with lower doses now being the preferred of choice. However, this change was gradual and arose not due to trial‐based evidence, but due to clinical experience and consensus. Chlorpromazine is one of the most widely used antipsychotic drugs yet appropriate use of lower levels has come about after many years of trial and error with much higher doses. In the absence of high‐grade evaluative studies, clinicians have had no alternative but to learn from experience. However, such an approach can lack scientific rigor and does not allow for proper dissemination of information that would assist clinicians find the optimum treatment dosage for their patients. In the future, data for recently released medication should be available from high‐quality trials and studies to provide optimum treatment to patients in the shortest amount of time. Plain language summary Chlorpromazine dose for people with schizophrenia Review question This review looks at the best dose of chlorpromazine for treating people with schizophrenia. Background Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting around 1% of the adult population worldwide. People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine was one of the first antipsychotic drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s. It still remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today. However, it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness. Study characteristics An updated search for relevant randomised controlled trials was run in October 2014, and again, in December 2016 and found one new study. Five studies have now been found that meet the review inclusion criteria. The included studies are all randomised, and investigate the effects of giving different doses of chlorpromazine to people with schizophrenia. The total number of participants was 585. Key results Chlorpromazine showed different effects at varying doses. Based on weak evidence, the effects on people’s mental health at low dosage and medium dosage are much the same. However, there are more side effects at medium dose. There is more improvement in people’s mental health at high dose compared to low dose. However, side effects are much more numerous and debilitating at high dose. In the past fifty years, low dose has been the favoured amount to use with patients. This change has come about gradually and is based on everyday experience and consensus rather than hard scientific evidence. Chlorpromazine is low‐cost and widely available. Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark or ‘gold standard’ drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide. Quality of the evidence All trials in the review are hospital‐ based and all but one date from 20 years ago. There are a limited number of studies of limited quality and these are poorly reported and short term. Further research and trials on chlorpromazine dose are justified.

The antiepileptic carbamazepine is one such drug. Objectives To examine whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine alone is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychoses and whether carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine augmentation of neuroleptic medication is an effective treatment for the same illnesses. Search methods For the original version we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register of Trials (December 2001),  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE (1966‐2001), EMBASE (1980‐2001), Biological Abstracts (1980‐2001), PsycLIT (1886‐2001) and PSYNDEX (1974‐2001). For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register of Trials in July 2012. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carbamazepine or compounds of the carbamazepine family with placebo or no intervention, whether as sole treatment or as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect, risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The updated search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria. The number of included studies therefore remains at 10 with the number of participants randomised still 283. One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months. No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n = 31, RR 1.07 CI 0.78 to 1.45). Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia. No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores (1 RCT n = 38, RR 1.23 CI 0.78 to 1.92). A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n = 38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.043). Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo, we were able use GRADE for quality of evidence for these results. Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n = 182, RR 0.47 CI 0.16 to 1.35,  very low quality evidence ). Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2 RCTs n = 38, RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.88). There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n = 147, RR 0.86 CI 0.67 to 1.12,  low quality evidence ). Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.38 CI 0.14 to 1.02). No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder. Authors conclusions Based on currently available randomised trial‐derived evidence, carbamazepine cannot be recommended for routine clinical use for treatment or augmentation of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia. At present large, simple well‐designed and reported trials are justified ‐ especially if focusing on people with violent episodes and people with schizoaffective disorders or those with both schizophrenia and EEG abnormalities. Plain language summary Carbamazepine for schizophrenia People with schizophrenia will often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). They may also experience apathy, tiredness, lack of drive and disorganised thoughts and behaviour. These symptoms make schizophrenia a severe illness that affects many people throughout their life. The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, although this medication is successful in treating the majority of people, 5% to 15% will continue to suffer from debilitating symptoms.

Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for these disorders. Antipsychotic medications are associated with a variety of adverse effects including tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia is difficult to treat, despite experimentation with several treatments. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been among these experimental treatments. Objectives To determine the effects of calcium channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic‐induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials comparing calcium channel blockers with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention for people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or serious mental illness who remained on their antipsychotic medication. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data and estimated risk ratios of dichotomous data or mean differences (MD) of continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who left the trials early had no improvement. We also created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results Previous versions of this review included no trials. From the 2015 search, we identified three cross‐over trials that could be included. The 2017 search found no new studies relevant to this review. The included trials randomised 47 inpatients with chronic mental illnesses in the USA and China. Trials were published in the 1990s and were of short duration (six to 10 weeks). Overall, the risk of bias was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, and attrition and outcome data were not fully reported. Findings were sparse, no study reported on the primary outcome no clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms, but two small studies (37 participants) found no difference on the tardive dyskinesia symptoms scale Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores between diltiazem or flunarizine and placebo after three to four weeks treatment (MD ‐0.71, 95% CI ‐2.68 to 1.26, very low quality evidence). Only one study randomising 20 participants reported on adverse events, and reported that there were no adverse events with flunarizine or with placebo (very low quality evidence). One study with 18 participants reported no events of deterioration in mental state with diltiazem or with placebo (very low quality evidence). No studies reported on acceptability of treatment or on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or personalised quality of life outcomes designated important to patients. Authors conclusions Available evidence from randomised controlled trials is extremely limited and very low quality, conclusions cannot be drawn. The effects of calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia are unknown. Their use is experimental and should only be given in the context of well‐designed randomised trials. Plain language summary Calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia Review question Are a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) useful for the treatment of an unpleasant side effect, tardive dyskinesia, in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems? Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are usually treated with antipsychotic medicines. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long‐term or high‐dose of antipsychotic medicines, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. A group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been used as experimental treatments for tardive dyskinesia. Study characteristics We searched for clinical trials (up to April 2017) using Cochrane Schizophrenias specialised register of trials. The review includes three small, short trials published in the 1990s. The trials randomised 47 people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had also developed tardive dyskinesia because they were taking antipsychotic medicines. The treatments the participants received were the calcium channel blockers, flunarizine, nifedipine or diltiazem hydrochloride or placebo (dummy treatment). Key results A small set of very low quality data were available from three small and poorly reported trials. Currently, it is uncertain whether calcium channel blockers are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia that is caused by taking antipsychotic medicines. Therefore, the use of calcium channel blockers for this purpose remains experimental. Quality of the evidence Evidence was limited and small scale. It is not possible to recommend these drugs as a treatment for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia. To fully investigate whether calcium channel blockers have any positive effects, there would have to be more well‐designed, conducted and reported clinical trials.

Long‐acting depot injections of drugs such as bromperidol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long‐term maintenance treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of depot bromperidol versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Search methods For this 2012 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (February 2012). Selection criteria We sought all randomised trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where depot bromperidol, oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations. Primary outcomes were clinically significant change in global function, service utilisation outcomes (hospital admission, days in hospital), relapse. Data collection and analysis For the 2011 update MP independently extracted data, CEA carried out the reliability check. We calculated fixed‐effect risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. For the 2012 update, data collection and analysis was not carried out as no new studies were found. Main results The 2012 search found no new studies, we have therefore included no new trials in this 2012 update. The number of included trials remain 4 RCTs, total n = 117. A single, small study of six months duration compared bromperidol decanoate with placebo injection. Similar numbers left the study before completion (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.6) and there were no clear differences between bromperidol decanoate and placebo for a list of adverse effects (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR akathisia 2.0 CI 0.21 to 18.69, RR increased weight 3.0 CI 0.14 to 65.9, RR tremor 0.33 CI 0.04 to 2.69). When bromperidol decanoate was compared with fluphenazine depot, we found no important change on global outcome (n = 30, RR no clinical important improvement 1.50 CI 0.29 to 7.73). People allocated to fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate had fewer relapses than those given bromperidol decanoate (n = 77, RR 3.92 Cl 1.05 to 14.60, NNH 6 CI 2 to 341). People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate, but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group more frequent than those taking other depot preparation due to any cause (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 2.17 CI 1.00 to 4.73). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n = 47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01). The incidence of movement disorders was similar in both depot groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.47 to 1.17). Authors conclusions Minimal poorly reported trial data suggests that bromperidol decanoate may be better than placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. If bromperidol decanoate is available it may be a viable choice, especially when there are reasons not to use fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. Well‐conducted and reported randomised trials are needed to inform practice. Plain language summary Depot bromperidol decanoate for schizophrenia Bromperidol decanoate is used as a long‐acting antipsychotic medication in at least Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. The preparation seems to be less potent than other depot antipsychotics (such as fluphenazine and haloperidol decanoate) and better than placebo injection. However, this older antipsychotic preparation has very few data from good quality studies and new trials are needed to fully understand the effects of this preparation."""

However, research into the drug was ceased in 2009 due to rejection of licence to go to market by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who could not approve the drug for acute or long‐term symptoms of schizophrenia because more research was required to demonstrate convincing effects ""beyond those already achieved"" with currently licenced drugs. There were also concerns expressed over one death of a person whilst on the drug. Objectives To investigate the clinical and adverse effects of bifeprunox for people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group\s Trials Register on 23 October 2015, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on bifeprunox versus placebo for schizophrenia. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created \Summary of findings\ tables using GRADE. Main results We included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found evidence of missing data and poor reporting. When bifeprunox 20 mg was compared with placebo for schizophrenia, the drug resulted in a reduction of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score regarding positive symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD ‐1.89, 95% CI ‐2.85 to ‐0.92,  low‐quality evidence ) and the PANSS negative subscale regarding negative symptoms (n = 549, 2 RCTs, MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐2.37 to ‐0.69,  low‐quality evidence ). There was a clear improvement regarding deterioration in the bifeprunox 20 mg group (n = 231, 1 RCT, RR 0.71 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.93,  very low‐quality evidence ). The total number of participants with equal to or greater than 7% weight increase was similar between bifeprunox and placebo (n = 483, 1 RCT, RR 1.02 95% CI 0.31 to 3.33  moderate‐quality evidence ). There were no useable data for quality of life, economic outcomes, and service use. Authors\ conclusions Our results showed some positive effects and a favourable adverse effect profile for bifeprunox, although there were few data overall and none were of high quality. It would seem that these data alone would not have been enough for the FDA to decide to halt progress of the drug to market. We can only assume that we are missing important data. Both the FDA and the relevant pharmaceutical companies have not made all relevant data accessible. As some of these trials also involved an additional haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone arm, these data are not only relevant to evaluation of bifeprunox. In not making all data accessible, it is hard to see how the FDA and the drug companies have fulfilled their full obligations to people with schizophrenia or their clinicians. Plain language summary Bifeprunox compared with placebo for schizophrenia Review question Is the antipsychotic bifeprunox an effective and safe treatment option for people with schizophrenia? Background Bifeprunox is an antipsychotic, developed to treat schizophrenia. It was thought to be effective for symptoms of schizophrenia whilst causing fewer of the side effects associated with other antipsychotics. However, in 2009 research into the drug was stopped , as it was considered to be no more effective than other available treatments, and there were concerns over the death of one person whilst on the drug. However, as many people with schizophrenia are resistant to current treatments, there is a need to explore new options. Bifeprunox was one of these. We reviewed the available evidence for efficacy, safety, and side effects of bifeprunox, in part to aid in understanding why use of the drug was halted. Searching for evidence The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched the specialised register in October 2015. He ran an electronic search for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either bifeprunox or placebo, finding 42 records. The review authors screened these for inclusion in the review. Evidence found Only four trials provided useable data, and these were of poor quality with some evidence of missing data. Two trials are completed but not yet published; we could not obtain any information from these trials that we could use in this review. The data available to us showed that bifeprunox improved participants\ scores on both positive and negative symptom scales. Weight increase was similar between those receiving bifeprunox and those allocated to placebo. Conclusions Data regarding the effects of bifeprunox are scarce. The data we found, which were of poor quality, showed no real evidence that bifeprunox is unsafe or ineffective. Its effects do not seem significantly different to other drugs that are currently on the market. More data on this compound exists but is not publicly available. We believe that the licencing authority in the USA must have had more information on which to base their important decision. The drug company also seemed to lose the will to move forward with bifeprunox. Whether or not the decision to prohibit access to a potentially useful drug was taken because of clear evidence of adverse effects, market calculations, or biases, it would seem an omission that all information upon which this decision was made is not in the public domain."

In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome. Objectives To examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non‐pharmacological approaches. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results Twenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes. Benzodiazepines versus placebo One trial compared benzodiazepines with placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants sedated at 24 hours ( very low quality evidence ). However, for the outcome of global state, clearly more people receiving placebo showed no improvement in the medium term (one to 48 hours) (n = 102, 1 RCT, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97,  very low quality evidence ).\u2028 \u2028 Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics When compared with haloperidol, there was no observed effect for benzodiazepines for sedation by 16 hours (n = 434, 8 RCTs, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.54, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who had not improved in the medium term (n = 188, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11,  low quality evidence ). However, one small study found fewer participants improved when receiving benzodiazepines compared with olanzapine (n = 150, 1 RCT, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.18,  very low quality evidence ). People receiving benzodiazepines were less likely to experience extrapyramidal effects in the medium term compared to people receiving haloperidol (n = 233, 6 RCTs, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41 , low quality evidence ). Benzodiazepines versus combined antipsychotics/antihistamines When benzodiazepine was compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (haloperidol plus promethazine), there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepines in the medium term (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.05,  low quality evidence ).

People with catatonia are more likely to require hospitalisation and highly supervised care than those without the disorder. They also have an increased risk of secondary complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration. The mainstay of treatment has been drug therapies and electroconvulsive therapy. Objectives To compare the effects of benzodiazepines with other drugs, placebo or electroconvulsive therapy for catatonia in people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses (SMIs). Search methods We updated our previous search (28 February 2007) by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (9 November 2016; 6 February 2019). This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register. We also manually searched reference lists from studies selected by the search. Selection criteria All controlled clinical trials that randomised people who have schizophrenia or other similar SMI and experiencing catatonia to receive benzodiazepines or another relevant treatment. We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported usable data. We excluded those not meeting our inclusion criteria or those not reporting usable data. We contacted authors when we required further information; and if we received no response, we put those studies aside as awaiting assessment. Data collection and analysis Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis using a fixed‐effect model. We completed a Risk of bias assessment for the included study and generated a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The searches found 130 citations, from which we could identify 22 possibly relevant studies. From these, we could only include one study. This study had a relatively small sample size of 17 participants who received lorazepam or oxazepam and were drug free for one week before the trial started. The only usable data reported by this study were clinically important change in symptoms of catatonia measured as 50% improvement on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). There was no difference in the numbers of participants showing a clinically important change in their catatonic symptoms (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.16; participants = 17; studies = 1; very low quality evidence). No data were reported for other important outcomes of hospital stay, clinically important change in satisfaction with care, global state, adverse effects or general functioning We did find a few studies meeting our inclusion criteria but they reported no usable data. We had to exclude these. Although poorly reported, these studies do illustrate that relevant studies have been undertaken — they are not impossible to design and conduct. Authors conclusions Analysis of the results from this review, which was a head‐to‐head comparison of two benzodiazepine monotherapies, does not show a clear difference in effect. No data were available for benzodiazepines compared to placebo or standard care. The lack of usable data and very low quality of data available makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions and further studies with a high‐quality methodology and reporting are required in order to determine more definitively the outcomes associated with benzodiazepine use in the clinical management of catatonia in persons with schizophrenia and other SMI.

Background \u2028 Catatonia is a debilitating condition that is characterised by diminished, excessive or peculiar movement and activity as well as diminished engagement with the social and physical environment. It can occur when a person has a number of different psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (an enduring mental illness whose hallmark is an altered perception of reality); and less frequently with medical conditions. Some of the other serious mental disorders that are associated with catatonia include bipolar disorder (an illness in which there are extremes of disturbed mood) and depression (another mood disorder characterized by low mood).

A wide range of strategies have been used to help manage TD, and for those who are unable to have their antipsychotic medication stopped or substantially changed, the benzodiazepine group of drugs have been suggested as a useful adjunctive treatment. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive. Objectives To determine the effects of benzodiazepines for antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other chronic mental illnesses. Search methods On 17 July 2015 and 26 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials (including trial registers), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of each included trial for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) and antipsychotic‐induced TD that compared benzodiazepines with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of TD. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from the included studies and ensured that they were reliably selected, and quality assessed. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We synthesised continuous data from valid scales using mean differences (MD). For continuous outcomes, we preferred endpoint data to change data. We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. Main results The review now includes four trials (total 75 people, one additional trial since 2006, 21 people) randomising inpatients and outpatients in China and the USA. Risk of bias was mostly unclear as reporting was poor. We are uncertain about all the effects as all evidence was graded at very low quality. We found no significant difference between benzodiazepines and placebo for the outcome of no clinically important improvement in TD (2 RCTs, 32 people, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.09, very low quality evidence). Significantly fewer participants allocated to clonazepam compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) experienced no clinically important improvement (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). For the outcome deterioration of TD symptoms, we found no clear difference between benzodiazepines and placebo (2 RCTs, 30 people, RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 9.82, very low quality evidence). All 10 participants allocated to benzodiazepines experienced any adverse event compared with 7/11 allocated to phenobarbital (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.41, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the incidence of participants leaving the study early for benzodiazepines compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 56 people, RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 48.04, very low quality evidence) or compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) (no events, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, which are outcomes designated important by patients. No trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or treatment as usual reported on adverse effects. Authors conclusions There is only evidence of very low quality from a few small and poorly reported trials on the effect of benzodiazepines as an adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic‐induced TD. These inconclusive results mean routine clinical use is not indicated and these treatments remain experimental. New and better trials are indicated in this under‐researched area; however, as benzodiazepines are addictive, we feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are chosen.

Background People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations), and have strange beliefs (delusions). The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary (uncontrollable and unintended) movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue, and jaw to convulse, spasm, and grimace. It is caused by prolonged or high‐dose use of antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat, and can be incurable. The benzodiazepine group of medicines have been suggested as a useful add‐on treatment for tardive dyskinesia. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive. Study characteristics The review includes four clinical trials with 75 people who had tardive dyskinesia as a result of using antipsychotic medicines. The participants were randomised into groups that received either their usual antipsychotic medicine plus a benzodiazepine or their usual antipsychotic plus a placebo (dummy medicine). Key results Improvement in TD symptoms was similar between the treatment groups. Participants were just as likely to leave the studies early from the placebo groups as the benzodiazepine groups. Data were not available for outcomes important to patients such as improvement in social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or quality of life. Quality of the evidence Evidence is limited because the trials are so few, small, and poorly reported. It is uncertain whether benzodiazepines are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The use of benzodiazepines for treating people with antipsychotic‐induced TD therefore remains experimental, and because they are highly addictive, a last resort. The low number of studies in this review strongly indicates that this is not an active area of research. To fully investigate whether benzodiazepines have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be more well‐designed, conducted and reported trials.

Over the past decade, the number of studies on treatment of adolescent‐onset psychosis has increased. The current systematic review collates and critiques evidence obtained on the use of various atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis. Objectives To investigate the effects of atypical antipsychotic medications in adolescents with psychosis. We reviewed in separate analyses various comparisons of atypical antipsychotic medications with placebo or a typical antipsychotic medication or another atypical antipsychotic medication or the same atypical antipsychotic medication but at a lower dose. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 2011), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies and contacted study authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies to ask for more information. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo or another pharmacological intervention or with psychosocial interventions, standard psychiatric treatment or no intervention in children and young people aged 13 to 18 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, acute and transient psychoses or unspecified psychosis. We included studies published in English and in other languages that were available in standardised databases. Data collection and analysis Review authors AK and SSD selected the studies, rated the quality of the studies and performed data extraction. For dichotomous data, we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed‐effect model. When possible, for binary data presented in the Summary of findings table, we calculated illustrative comparative risks. We summated continuous data using the mean difference (MD). Risk of bias was assessed for included studies. Main results We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 1112 participants. We found no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response. Trials were classified into the following groups. 1. Atypical antipsychotics versus placebo\u2028 Only two studies compared one atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo. In one study, the number of non‐responders treated with olanzapine was not different from the number treated with placebo (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10); however, significantly more (57% vs 32%) people left the study early (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87) from the placebo group compared with the olanzapine group. With regard to adverse effects, young people treated with aripiprazole had significantly lower serum cholesterol compared with those given placebo (1 RCT, n = 302, RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.58). 2. Atypical antipsychotics versus typical antipsychotics\u2028 When the findings of all five trials comparing atypical antipsychotic medications with a typical antipsychotic medication were collated, no difference in the mean end point Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was noted between the two arms (5 RCTs, n = 236, MD ‐1.08, 95% CI ‐3.08 to 0.93). With regard to adverse effects, the mean end point serum prolactin concentration was much higher than the reference range for treatment with risperidone, olanzapine and molindone in one of the studies. However, fewer adolescents who were receiving atypical antipsychotic medications left the study because of adverse effects (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15) or for any reason (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). 3. One atypical antipsychotic versus another atypical antipsychotic\u2028 The mean end point BPRS score was not significantly different for people who received risperidone compared with those who received olanzapine; however, the above data were highly skewed. Overall no difference was noted in the number of people leaving the studies early because of any adverse effects between each study arm in the three studies comparing olanzapine and risperidone (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.04). Specific adverse events were not reported uniformly across the six different studies included in this section of the review; therefore it was difficult to do a head‐to‐head comparison of adverse events for different atypical antipsychotic medications. 4. Lower‐dose atypical antipsychotic versus standard/higher‐dose atypical antipsychotic\u2028 Three studies reported comparisons of lower doses of the atypical antipsychotic medication with standard/higher doses of the same medication. One study reported better symptom reduction with a standard dose of risperidone as compared with a low dose (1 RCT, n = 257, RR ‐8.00, 95% CI ‐13.75 to ‐2.25). In another study, no difference was reported in the number of participants not achieving remission between the group receiving 10 mg/d and those who received 30 mg/d of aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 196, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Similarly in the other study, authors reported no statistically significant difference in clinical response between the two groups receiving lower‐dose (80 mg/d) and higher‐dose (160 mg/d) ziprasidone, as reflected by the mean end point BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 17, MD ‐4.40, 95% CI ‐19.20 to 10.40). Authors conclusions No convincing evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic medications are superior to typical medications for the treatment of adolescents with psychosis. However, atypical antipsychotic medications may be more acceptable to young people because fewer symptomatic adverse effects are seen in the short term. Little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic medication over another, but side effect profiles are different for different medications. Treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is often associated with weight gain. Aripiprazole is not associated with increased prolactin or with dyslipidaemia. Adolescents may respond better to standard‐dose as opposed to lower‐dose risperidone, but for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, lower doses may be equally effective. Future trials should ensure uniform ways of reporting. Plain language summary Atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis Schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses often begin in adolescence, and treatment of adolescents with psychosis usually involves use of antipsychotic drugs. Newer drugs (atypical antipsychotics) are more popular than older ones (typical antipsychotics). However, this determination is based on the generalisation of adult treatment to a younger age group, with evidence from studies on adults generally guiding the treatment of adolescents.  Adolescents may respond differently to medication compared with adults. This review looks at evidence derived from trials in which the participants are adolescents receiving atypical or typical antipsychotics or a placebo (dummy treatment) and/or high or low doses of medication. A total of 13 trials consisting of 1112 people between 13 and 18 years of age are included. Most studies were short‐term trials (completed within 12 weeks). In the main, no convincing evidence shows that newer drugs (atypical antipsychotics) are better than older ones (typical antipsychotics) in terms of their ability to treat the symptoms of psychosis. However, newer drugs may be more acceptable for young people to take because they produce fewer side effects in the short term. Furthermore, very little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic over another atypical antipsychotic. The nature of side effects also differs markedly between medications. For example, treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is associated with weight gain, but aripiprazole is not associated with weight gain. Some evidence indicates that adolescents respond better to standard‐dose as opposed to lower‐dose risperidone. However, for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, a lower dose and a standard dose may be equally effective. Longer, clearer and more detailed research trials that use systematic ways of reporting and comparing the side effects of different antipsychotic drugs are much needed. So too is a research focus on other important outcomes such as hospital admission, service use, costs, behaviour change and possible improvements in people’s thinking. Until such research is completed, very little evidence suggests that newer drugs (atypical antipsychotics) are better than older drugs (typical antipsychotics) for the treatment of adolescents with schizophrenia.

Also the low costs and wide availability of electronic devices make it more feasible to use electronic devices for the benefit of disabled persons.

Asenapine is a recently developed atypical antipsychotic that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia. Objectives To determine the clinical effects of asenapine for adults with schizophrenia or other schizophrenia‐like disorders by comparing it with placebo. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (July 04, 2014) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitation for inclusion of records into the register. We inspected references of all included studies for further relevant studies. Selection criteria Our review includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing asenapine with placebo in adults (however defined) with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder, again, by any means of diagnosis. Data collection and analysis We inspected citations from the searches and identified relevant abstracts, and extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and for continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We used the GRADE approach to produce a Summary of findings table which included our outcomes of interest, where possible. We used a fixed‐effect model for our analyses. Main results We obtained and scrutinised 41 potentially relevant records, and from these we could include only six trials (n = 1835). Five of the six trials had high risk of attrition bias and all trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Results showed a clinically important change in global state (1 RCT, n = 336, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97, low‐quality evidence) and mental state (1 RCT, n = 336, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86, very low‐quality evidence) at short‐term amongst people receiving asenapine. People receiving asenapine demonstrated significant reductions in negative symptoms (1 RCT, n = 336, MD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐2.29 to 0.09, very low‐quality evidence) at short‐term. Individuals receiving asenapine demonstrated significantly fewer incidents of serious adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 386, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.63, very low‐quality evidence) at medium‐term. There was no clear difference in people discontinuing the study for any reason between asenapine and placebo at short‐term (5 RCTs, n = 1046, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04, very low‐quality evidence). No trial reported data for extrapyramidal symptoms or costs. Authors conclusions There is some, albeit preliminary, evidence that asenapine provides an improvement in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms, whilst minimising the risk of adverse effects. However due to the low‐quality and limited quantity of evidence, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for people with schizophrenia. We identify a need for large‐scale, longer‐term, better‐designed and conducted randomised controlled trials investigating the clinical effects and safety of asenapine. Plain language summary Asenapine versus placebo for schizophrenia Review question Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the early‐to‐mid 1990s. The review looks at the effects of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo. Background People with schizophrenia often have positive symptoms, such as hearing voices, seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions). People also have negative symptoms, including loss of emotions, apathy, social withdrawal, lack of pleasure and difficulty speaking and communicating. Disorder of thoughts, anxiety and depression are common. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs, which are divided into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). These drugs often have severe side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, involuntary shaking and tiredness. Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the 1990s. At present there are no systematic reviews assessing the effects of this drug. Study characteristics The review includes six trials with 1835 people. The trials randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either asenapine or placebo. Five of these trials had high rates of people leaving early and were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Key results There is some evidence that asenapine, when compared to placebo, improves the positive, negative and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia while having less risk of debilitating side effects. Quality of the evidence However, due to the low quantity and limited quality of evidence currently available, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for schizophrenia. There is a need for large‐scale, longer‐term follow up, and bias‐free randomised controlled trials investigating the effects and safety of asenapine.

Typical and atypical antipsychotics do provide a treatment response for most people with schizophrenia, whether a reduction in psychotic episodes or a lessening in the severity of their illness. However, a proportion of people still do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication. Additionally, atypical and especially typical antipsychotics are associated with serious adverse effects, which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse. In this review we examine the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo. Objectives To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2008) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. For this update, we carried out an initial search in May 2007 and a second search in August 2008. Selection criteria We included all randomised trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychosis. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a fixed‐effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a fixed‐effect model. Main results Despite the fact that 2585 people participated in nine randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment; economic outcomes or cognitive functioning. In general, study attrition was very large for all studies over four weeks duration. There was high attrition in most of the included studies. Fewer people left the aripiprazole group compared with those in the placebo group (n = 2585, 9 RCTs, RR 0.73 CI 0.60 to 0.87). Compared with placebo, aripiprazole significantly decreased relapse in both the short (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.45 to 0.77) and medium term (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.53 to 0.81). It also produced better compliance with study protocol (n = 2275, 8 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.59 to 0.93). Aripiprazole may decrease prolactin levels below those expected from placebo (n = 305, 2 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.11 to 0.37). Insomnia (˜23%) and headaches (˜15%) were commonly reported in both groups, with no significant difference. Authors conclusions Aripiprazole may be effective for the treatment of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole has a lower risk of raised prolactin and prolongation of the QTc interval. Clearly reported pragmatic short‐, medium‐ and long‐term randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to determine its position in everyday clinical practice. Plain language summary Aripiprazole versus placebo for schizophrenia Schizophrenia is one of the major psychiatric disorders; it affects individuals thinking, perception, affect and behaviour. It can occur in around 1% of the population. Aripiprazole is one of the newer antipsychotic medications introduced for the treatment of schizophrenia. When compared with placebo, people taking aripiprazole had fewer relapses, smaller numbers of participants left study early, and needed less additional antipsychotic medications. Insomnia and headache were the most commonly reported side effects, but were not much difference to placebo. Side effects such as akathisia, nausea and weight gain occurred more in the aripripazole group as compared to placebo. There has been a worry with newer antipsychotic medications and their effect on conductance problems in the heart, impaired glucose levels and excessive production of prolactin (which can cause unpleasant breast pain and secretion). On the limited evidence available (due to participants leaving early and fewer studies) aripiprazole appears to have a similar effect to that of placebo. The overall finding on its efficacy in treating schizophrenia is unchanged from those found in the original review."""

In this review, we specifically examine how the efficacy and tolerability of one such agent ‐ aripiprazole ‐ differs from that of other comparable second generation antipsychotics. Objectives To review the effects of aripiprazole compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2012), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing aripiprazole (oral) with oral and parenteral forms of amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random‐effects model. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and used GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. Main results We now have included 174 trials involving 17,244 participants. Aripiprazole was compared with clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and olanzapine. The overall number of participants leaving studies early was 30% to 40%, limiting validity (no differences between groups). When compared with clozapine, there were no significant differences for global state (no clinically significant response, n = 2132, 29 RCTs,  low quality evidence ); mental state (BPRS, n = 426, 5 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 240, 3 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Quality of life score using the WHO‐QOL‐100 scale demonstrated significant difference, favouring aripiprazole (n = 132, 2 RCTs, RR 2.59 CI 1.43 to 3.74,  very low quality evidence ). General extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were no different between groups (n = 520, 8 RCTs, very low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning or service use. When compared with quetiapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 991, 12 RCTs,  low quality evidence ); mental state (PANSS positive symptoms, n = 583, 7 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); leaving the study early for any reason (n = 168, 2 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ), or general EPS symptoms (n = 348, 4 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Results were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for quality of life (WHO‐QOL‐100 total score, n = 100, 1 RCT, MD 2.60 CI 1.31 to 3.89,  very low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning or service use. When compared with risperidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 6381, 80 RCTs,  low quality evidence ); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 1239, 12 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Data were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for improvement in mental state using the BPRS (n = 570, 5 RCTs, MD 1.33 CI 2.24 to 0.42,  very low quality evidence ); with higher adverse effects seen in participants receiving risperidone of general EPS symptoms (n = 2605, 31 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.31 to 0.50,  low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use. When compared with ziprasidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 442, 6 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); mental state using the BPRS (n = 247, 1 RCT,  very low quality evidence ); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 316, 2 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ). Weight gain was significantly greater in people receiving aripiprazole (n = 232, 3 RCTs, RR 4.01 CI 1.10 to 14.60,  very low quality evidence ). No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use. When compared with olanzapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 1739, 11 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); mental state using PANSS (n = 1500, 11 RCTs,  very low quality evidence ); or quality of life using the GQOLI‐74 scale (n = 68, 1 RCT,  very low quality of evidence ). Significantly more people receiving aripiprazole left the study early due to any reason (n = 2331, 9 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 1.05 to 1.25,  low quality evidence ) and significantly more people receiving olanzapine gained weight (n = 1538, 9 RCTs, RR 0.25 CI 0.15 to 0.43,  very low quality evidence ). None of the included studies provided outcome data for the comparisons of service use or general functioning. Authors conclusions Information on all comparisons is of limited quality, is incomplete and problematic to apply clinically. The quality of the evidence is all low or very low. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug with an important adverse effect profile. Long‐term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerge from ongoing larger, independent pragmatic trials. Plain language summary Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics In many countries in the industrialised world there has been a huge growth in the prescription of medication for people with mental health problems, taken orally as a tablet or by injection. Atypical and second generation antipsychotic drugs have become ever more popular, because they are thought to help people with mental health problems who do not respond quite so well to initial treatment. These newer drugs hold the promise of both reducing symptoms, such as hearing voices or seeing things, and reducing problematic side effects, such as sleepiness, weight gain, and shaking. However, there is little research and comparison of the ways in which drugs differ from one another. This review examines the effectiveness of aripiprazole with other new antipsychotics.\u2028 \u2028 Originally the review included 12 research trials. After an update search carried out in November 2012, 162 trials were added. Most of these trials were from China and although new data were added to the review, overall conclusions did not change. The review now has five comparisons with aripiprazole being compared with clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. For people with schizophrenia it may be important to know that aripiprazole may not be as good or effective as olanzapine but that it has less side effects. Aripiprazole is similar in effectiveness to risperidone and somewhat better than ziprasidone. Aripiprazole had less side‐ effects than olanzapine and risperidone (such as weight gain, sleepiness, heart problems, shaking and increased cholesterol levels). Aripiprazole was not as good as ziprasidone for dealing with restlessness or people’s inability to sit still. Comparison with other antipsychotic drugs as a group showed that people preferred taking aripiprazole. However, people with schizophrenia as well as mental health professionals and policy makers should know that the evidence is limited and mostly of low or very low quality.

Search methods On 11 December 2014 and 11 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that randomised people with psychosis‐induced aggression or agitation to receive either intramuscular aripiprazole or another intramuscular intervention. Data collection and analysis We independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed these. We included studies that met our selection criteria. At least two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We chose a fixed‐effect model. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MD) and their CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to create Summary of findings tables. Main results Searching found 63 records referring to 21 possible trials. We could only include three studies, all completed over the last decade, with 885 participants, of which 707 were included for quantitative analyses in this systematic review. Due to limited comparisons, small size of trials and a paucity of investigated and reported pragmatic outcomes, evidence was mostly graded as low or very low quality. No trials reported useful data for one of our primary outcomes of tranquil or asleep by 30 minutes. Economic outcomes were also not reported in the trials. When compared with placebo, fewer people in the aripiprazole group needed additional injections compared to the placebo group (2 RCTs, n = 382, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85,  very low‐quality evidence ). Clinically important improvement in agitation at two hours favoured the aripiprazole group (2 RCTs, n = 382, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92,  very low‐quality evidence ). The numbers of non‐responders after the first injection also favoured aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 263, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.71,  low‐quality evidence ). Although no effect was found, more people in the aripiprazole compared to the placebo group experienced adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 117, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.46,  very low‐quality evidence ). Aripiprazole required more injections compared to haloperidol (2 RCTs, n = 477, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63,  very low‐quality evidence ), with no significant difference in agitation (2 RCTs, n = 477, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11,  very low‐quality evidence ), and similar non‐responders after first injection (1 RCT, n = 360, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.79,  low‐quality evidence ). Aripiprazole and haloperidol did not differ when taking into account the overall number of people that experienced at least one adverse effect (1 RCT, n = 113, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.35,  very low‐quality evidence ). Compared to aripiprazole, olanzapine was better at reducing agitation (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99,  low‐quality evidence ) and had a more favourable effect on global state change scores (1 RCT, n = 80, MD 0.58, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.15,  low‐quality evidence ), both at two hours. No differences were found in terms of experiencing at least one adverse effect during the 24 hours after treatment (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.24,  very low‐quality evidence ). However, participants allocated to aripiprazole experienced less somnolence (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.82,  low‐quality evidence ). Authors conclusions The available evidence is of poor quality but there is some evidence aripiprazole is effective compared to placebo and haloperidol, but not when compared to olanzapine. However, considering that evidence comes from only three studies, caution is required in generalising these results to real‐world practice. This review firmly highlights the need for more high‐quality trials on intramuscular aripiprazole in the management of people with acute aggression or agitation. Plain language summary How effective is aripiprazole for calming people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis? Background \u2028 People with psychosis may experience hearing voices (hallucinations) or abnormal thoughts (delusions) which can make them frightened, distressed and agitated (restless, excitable or irritable). Experiencing such emotions can sometimes result in behaviour that is aggressive or violent. This poses a challenge and dilemma for mental health professionals who have to diagnose and, often quickly, give the best available treatment to prevent those who are aggressive, harming themselves or others. Aripiprazole is a medication that can be used to treat psychosis and also calm people who are aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. It can be taken by mouth or by injection (intramuscular). However, aripiprazole can also cause unpleasant side effects such as headaches, upset stomach, and excessive sleepiness or drowsiness. This review looks for evidence from randomised controlled trials that assesses the effectiveness of intramuscular aripiprazole for people who are agitated and aggressive as a result of having psychosis. Searching \u2028 The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group ran an electronic search in 2014 and in 2017 for studies randomising adults with aggression due to psychosis to receive either injections of aripiprazole or injections of a placebo (dummy treatment) or injections of another antipsychotic. The search found 63 relevant records, referring to 21 trials. Review authors screened these records for inclusion or exclusion. Main results \u2028 Only three studies could be included. Evidence is limited due to the small number of trials and poor quality of data reported. Fewer people receiving aripiprazole required more injections to become calm than those receiving placebo or haloperidol. Overall, aripiprazole caused a similar number of adverse effects to placebo or haloperidol. Compared to olanzapine, aripiprazole was less effective at calming people but caused less sleepiness or drowsiness Conclusions \u2028 Some evidence is available, but is of poor quality, and it is difficult to make conclusions about aripiprazoles effectiveness from such data. Health professionals and people with mental health problems are therefore left without clear guidance concerning use of aripiprazole as a rapid tranquilliser. More research is needed to help people consider which medication is better at calming people down, has fewer adverse effects, and works quickly and rapidly."""

Switching strategies have been recommended as a management option. Objectives To determine the effects of antipsychotic medication switching as a strategy for reducing or preventing weight gain and metabolic problems in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups trials register (January 2005 and June 2007), reference sections within relevant papers and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information. We updated this search November 2012 and added 167 new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria All clinical randomised controlled trials comparing switching of antipsychotic medication as an intervention for antipsychotic induced weight gain and metabolic problems with continuation of medication and/or other weight loss treatments (pharmacological and non pharmacological) in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Data collection and analysis Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on a fixed‐effect model. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, metabolic syndrome, relapse and general mental state. Main results We included four studies for the review with a total of 636 participants. All except one study had a duration of 26 weeks or less. There was a mean weight loss of 1.94 kg (2 RCT, n = 287, CI ‐3.9 to 0.08) when switched to aripiprazole or quetiapine from olanzapine. BMI also decreased when switched to quetiapine (1 RCT, n = 129, MD ‐0.52 CI ‐1.26 to 0.22) and aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 173, RR 0.28 CI 0.13 to 0.57) from olanzapine. Fasting blood glucose showed a significant decrease when switched to aripiprazole or quetiapine from olanzapine. (2 RCT, MD ‐2.53 n = 280 CI ‐2.94 to ‐2.11). One RCT also showed a favourable lipid profile when switched to aripiprazole but these measures were reported as percentage changes, rather than means with standard deviation. People are less likely to leave the study early if they remain on olanzapine compared to switching to quetiapine or aripiprazole. There was no significant difference in outcomes of mental state, global state, and adverse events between groups which switched medications and those that remained on previous medication. Three different switching strategies were compared and no strategy was found to be superior to the others for outcomes of weight gain, mental state and global state. Authors conclusions Evidence from this review suggests that switching antipsychotic medication to one with lesser potential for causing weight gain or metabolic problems could be an effective way to manage these side effects, but the data were weak due to the limited number of trials in this area and small sample sizes. Poor reporting of data also hindered using some trials and outcomes. There was no difference in mental state, global state and other treatment related adverse events between switching to another medication and continuing on the previous one. When the three switching strategies were compared none of them had an advantage over the others in their effects on the primary outcomes considered in this review. Better designed trials with adequate power would provide more convincing evidence for using medication switching as an intervention strategy. Note"""

These drugs, however, have also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) – a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements around the mouth and face. Various strategies have been examined to reduce a persons cumulative exposure to antipsychotics. These strategies include dose reduction, intermittent dosing strategies such as drug holidays, and antipsychotic cessation. Objectives To determine whether a reduction or cessation of antipsychotic drugs is associated with a reduction in TD for people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) who have existing TD. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the use of specific antipsychotics for similar groups of people could be a treatment for TD that was already established. Search methods We updated previous searches of Cochrane Schizophrenias study‐based Register of Trials including the registers of clinical trials (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We also contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports if they assessed people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had established antipsychotic‐induced TD, and had been randomly allocated to (a) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic cessation (placebo or no intervention), (b) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic reduction (including intermittent strategies), (c) specific antipsychotics for the treatment of TD versus placebo or no intervention, and (d) specific antipsychotics versus other antipsychotics or versus any other drugs for the treatment of TD. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who dropped out had no improvement. Main results We included 13 RCTs with 711 participants; eight of these studies were newly included in this 2017 update. One trial is ongoing. There was low‐quality evidence of a clear difference on no clinically important improvement in TD favouring switch to risperidone compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (1 RCT, 42 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.23 to 0.89, low‐quality evidence). Because evidence was of very low quality for antipsychotic dose reduction versus antipsychotic maintenance (2 RCTs, 17 people, RR 0.42 95% CI 0.17 to 1.04, very low‐quality evidence), and for switch to a new antipsychotic versus switch to another new antipsychotic (5 comparisons, 5 RCTs, 140 people, no meta‐analysis, effects for all comparisons equivocal), we are uncertain about these effects. There was low‐quality evidence of a significant difference on extrapyramidal symptoms"""

Recommendations for their treatment are largely based on data extrapolated from studies of the use of antipsychotic medications in younger populations. In addition most manufacturers of such medications recommend prescription of reduced doses to the elderly. The evidence base for these assumptions is unclear and raises obvious questions regarding the appropriateness of such prescribing practice. Objectives To find and assimilate good evidence of the effects of antipsychotic medication for treatment of schizophrenia in people over 65 years of age. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (May 2003). We inspected references of all included studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria All clinical randomised trials evaluating antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychoses in older people. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data, the random effects, relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Main results Two hundred and fifty two elderly people with schizophrenia participated in three relevant randomised controlled studies. We were unable to extract usable data on quality of life, satisfaction, service use, or economic outcomes. One small study (n=18) compared thioridazine with remoxipride (RR leaving the study early 1.0 CI 0.07 to 13.6). A second study (n=175) compared risperidone with olanzapine. Global state not improved/worse was not significantly different between treatments (n= 171, RR 1.26 CI 0.8 to 1.9); mental state PANSS total endpoint scores were also equivocal (n=171, RR 0.98 CI 0.76 to 1.26) as were all cognitive function tests. The third study (subset n=59) compared olanzapine with haloperidol and mental state change scores (BPRS WMD ‐3.60 CI ‐10.8 to 3.6; PANSS WMD ‐6.00 CI ‐18.3 to 6.3) were equivocal. Authors conclusions Antipsychotics may be widely used in the treatment of elderly people with schizophrenia, however, based on this systematic review, there are little robust data available to guide the clinician with respect to the most appropriate drug to prescribe. Clearly reported large short, medium and long‐term randomised controlled trials with participants, interventions and primary outcomes that are familiar to those wishing to help elderly people with schizophrenia are long overdue. Plain language summary Antipsychotic medication for elderly people with schizophrenia Since the early 1950s the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia has been drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. Although effective in controlling voices and fixed, false beliefs, these drugs are reported as having potentially disabling adverse effects such as tremor, stiffness and slowing of movement. The newer generation of drugs are reputed to be freer from these problems. This is particularly important for older people, who are more likely to experience adverse effects. Most manufacturers recommend prescription of reduced doses in the elderly. This review examines trials of these drugs for the treatment of elderly people with schizophrenia. We found three small, short trials. These did not have much information that was usable and we really could not draw any firm conclusions, except that such studies are possible and more are needed as a matter of urgency."""

However, onset after the age of 40 years is reported in 23% of patients hospitalised with schizophrenia. At least 0.1% of the worlds elderly population have a diagnosis of late‐onset schizophrenia which seems to differ from earlier onset schizophrenia on a variety of counts including response to antipsychotic drugs. Objectives To assess the effects of antipsychotic drugs for elderly people with late‐onset schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2010) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information. We updated this search Janurary 2013 and added 48 new trials to the awaiting classification section. Selection criteria All relevant randomised controlled trials that compared antipsychotic drugs with other treatments for elderly people (at least 80% older than 65 years) with a recent (within five years) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia like illnesses. Data collection and analysis For the 2010 search, two new review authors (AE, AG) inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. We assessed methodological quality of trials using the criteria recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  AE and AG also independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Main results There were no included studies in the original version of this review (2002 search). The 2010 search for the current update produced 211 references, among which we identified 88 studies. Only one study met the inclusion criteria and was of acceptable quality. This was an eight‐week randomised trial of risperidone and olanzapine in 44 inpatients with late‐onset schizophrenia. All participants completed the eight‐week trial, indicating that both drugs were well tolerated. Unfortunately, this study provided little usable data. We excluded a total of 81 studies, 77 studies because they either studied interventions other than antipsychotic medication or because they involved elderly people with chronic ‐ not late‐onset ‐ schizophrenia. We excluded a further four trials of antipsychotics in late‐onset schizophrenia because of flawed design. Five studies are still awaiting classification, and one is on‐going. Authors conclusions There is no trial‐based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of late‐onset schizophrenia. There is a need for good quality‐controlled clinical trials into the effects of antipsychotics for this group. Such trials are possible. Until they are undertaken, people with late‐onset schizophrenia will be treated by doctors using clinical judgement and habit to guide prescribing. Note"""

Among many possible candidates, oxidative stress may be one of the mediators of neuroprogression, grey matter loss and subsequent cognitive and functional impairment. Antioxidants are exogenous or endogenous molecules that mitigate any form of oxidative stress or its consequences. They may act from directly scavenging free radicals to increasing anti‐oxidative defences. There is evidence that current treatments impact oxidative pathways and may to some extent reverse pro‐oxidative states in schizophrenia. The existing literature, however, indicates that these treatments do not fully restore the deficits in antioxidant levels or restore levels of oxidants in schizophrenia. As such, there has been interest in developing interventions aimed at restoring this oxidative balance beyond the benefits of antipsychotics in this direction. If antioxidants are to have a place in the treatment of this serious condition, the relevant and up‐to‐date information should be available to clinicians and investigators. Objectives To evaluate the effect of antioxidants as add‐on treatments to standard antipsychotic medication for improving acute psychotic episodes and core symptoms, and preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We ran this search in November 2010, and again on 8 January 2015. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with schizophrenia who had been allocated to either a substance with antioxidant potential or to a placebo as an adjunct to standard antipsychotic treatment. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The review includes 22 RCTs of varying quality and sample size studying  Ginkgo biloba , N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), allopurinol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vitamin C, vitamin E or selegiline. Median follow‐up was eight weeks. Only three studies including a minority of the participants reported our  a priori  selected primary outcome of clinically important response. Short‐term data for this outcome (measured as at least 20% improvement in scores on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) were similar (3 RCTs, n = 229, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.12,  low quality evidence ). Studies usually reported only endpoint psychopathology rating scale scores. Psychotic symptoms were lower in those using an adjunctive antioxidant according to the PANSS ( 7 RCTS, n = 584, MD ‐6.00, 95% CI ‐10.35 to ‐1.65,  very low quality evidence ) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (8 RCTS, n = 843, MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐5.63 to ‐0.78,  low quality evidence ). There was no overall short‐term difference in leaving the study early (16 RCTs, n = 1584, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11,  moderate quality evidence ), or in general functioning (2 RCTs, n = 52, MD ‐1.11, 95% CI ‐8.07 to 5.86,  low quality evidence ). Adverse events were generally poorly reported. Three studies reported useable data for any serious adverse effect, results were equivocal (3 RCTs, n = 234, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.27,  low quality evidence ). No evidence was available for relapse, quality of life or service use. Authors conclusions Although 22 trials could be included in this review, the evidence provided is limited and mostly not relevant to clinicians or consumers. Overall, although there was low risk of attrition and selective data reporting bias within the trials, the trials themselves were not adequately powered and need more substantial follow‐up periods. There is a need for larger trials with longer periods of follow‐up to be conducted. Outcomes should be meaningful for those with schizophrenia, and include measures of improvement and relapse (not just rating scale scores), functioning and quality of life and acceptability and, importantly, safety data. Plain language summary Antioxidants as add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia Antioxidants are substances that protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals (causing oxidative stress). It is well known that adding antioxidant‐rich fruits and vegetables to your daily diet will strengthen your ability to fight infection and disease. There is recent evidence that progressive brain changes take place as schizophrenia unfolds. Among many possible explanations, oxidative stress may be one of the factors contributing to the deterioration of the brain and its grey matter, leading to difficulties in people’s thinking and everyday functioning. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effect of antioxidants as an add‐on treatment to standard antipsychotic medication. In particular, by reducing (or lessening) psychotic episodes and core symptoms, and preventing relapse Searches for randomised trials were run in 2010 and 2012, review authors found 22 relevant trials that randomised a total of 2041 people with schizophrenia. The trials compared the effects of taking a variety of antioxidants (allopurinol,  Ginkgo biloba , N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), selegiline, vitamins C and E) compared with placebo. Most results showed no real differences between the antioxidants and placebo although there was evidence  Ginkgo biloba  had a positive effect on psychotic symptoms in the short term. The quality of this evidence was moderate. However, overall, the trials suffered from a lack of real‐world outcomes, such as clinical response, rates of relapse, quality of life, functioning, safety and satisfaction or acceptability of treatment. Adverse effects were also poorly reported with some studies not providing any data for adverse effects. Ginkgo biloba  and NAC emerged from the trials as the most promising, so should have priority in the design of future trials that are larger, longer and better reported than the 22 studies available at the present time.

To determine the effects of antiglucocorticoid and related drugs for the treatment of psychosis, when used alone or in combination with antipsychotic medication. 2. To determine whether the effects of these medications differs between those in a prodromal phase or first episode of psychosis, and those with more established illness.

We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for continuous measures. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to create a Summary of findings table. Main results We included 11 studies that randomly assigned 509 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. No trials were conducted in patients at their first episode of psychotic illness and none included populations at high risk for developing psychosis. Our pre‐stated outcomes of interest were mental state, global state, general functioning, adverse effects and quality of life. Two trials compared antiglucocorticoid drugs (mifepristone) versus placebo as sole treatment. Limited data from one trial showed no difference in the proportion responding to mifepristone when mental state was assessed immediately post intervention using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (n = 5, 1 RCT, MD ‐5.20, 95% CI ‐17.91 to 7.51;  very low‐quality evidence ); depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) total) were also similar between groups (n = 5, 1 RCT, MD 1.67, 95% CI ‐16.44 to 19.78;  very low‐quality evidence ). However, a significant difference favoured treatment at short‐term follow‐up for global state (30% reduction in total BPRS, n = 221, 1 RCT, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89;  low‐grade quality evidence ). This effect was also seen for short‐term positive psychotic symptoms (50% reduction in BPRS positive symptom subscale, n = 221, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84;  low‐grade quality evidence ). Participants receiving mifepristone experienced a similar overall number of adverse effects as those receiving placebo (n = 226, 2 RCTs, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09;  moderate‐quality evidence ). No data on general functioning or quality of life were available. One trial compared an antiglucocorticoid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as an adjunct to atypical antipsychotic treatment to adjunctive placebo. Data for main outcomes of interest were of low quality, and analysis of useable data showed no significant effects of treatment on mental state or adverse effects. Data on global state, general functioning and quality of life were not available. Data from six trials comparing antiglucocorticoid drugs as an adjunct to combination treatment versus adjunctive placebo showed no significant differences between groups in mean endpoint scores for overall psychotic symptoms (n = 171, 6 RCTs, SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐ 0.29 to 0.32) or positive psychotic symptoms (n = 151, 5 RCTs, SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐ 0.40 to 0.25). Data from three trials showed no differences between groups in mean endpoint scores for negative symptoms (n = 94, 3 RCTs, MD 2.21, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 4.55). One study found improvements in global state that were similar between groups (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.06;  very low‐quality evidence ). In this comparison, pooled results showed that antiglucorticoids caused a greater overall number of adverse events (n = 199, 7 RCTs, RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.32;  moderate quality evidence ), but no quality of life data were available. Authors conclusions Good evidence is insufficient to conclude whether antiglucocorticoid drugs provide effective treatment for psychosis. Some global state findings suggest a favourable effect for mifepristone, and a few overall adverse effect findings favour placebo. Additional large randomised controlled trials are needed to justify findings. Plain language summary Antiglucocorticoid and related treatments for psychosis Psychosis is a broad term that includes several mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic depression and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Psychotic disorders affect about 3% of the population and may cause high levels of disability, making it a significant public health problem both socially and economically. Stress may result in the release of cortisol and has been linked with both onset and relapse of psychotic disorders. Elevated cortisol levels have been found in some people with psychosis, especially among those suffering with psychotic depression and those in earlier phases of psychosis. Antiglucocorticoid drugs have been reported to reduce the effects of cortisol and may be useful for people with psychotic depression and bipolar disorder. We reviewed all randomised trials comparing antiglucocorticoid and related drugs versus placebo in people with psychosis ‐ prodromal psychosis or first episode of psychosis. Eleven studies (involving 509 participants) were included in this review. Several antiglucocorticoid‐related drugs were examined, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (n = 5), mifepristone (n = 4), dexamethasone (n = 1) and ketoconazole (n = 1). All participants were adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Most trials examined giving antiglucocorticoid drugs as an additional part of regular treatment. Available data from these trials revealed no effects for overall psychotic symptoms, positive symptoms or negative symptoms. One large trial comparing mifepristone versus placebo as the sole treatment revealed a significant difference in the proportion of people responding to treatment with mifepristone versus placebo. This effect was not seen immediately but 21 days after the intervention was begun. Adverse effect data varied. When individual anticorticoids such as mifepristone and DHEA were compared with placebo, the incidence of side effects was similar between groups; however, pooled data on various antiglucorticoids given as an adjunct to combination treatment showed that antiglucocorticoids increased incidence of side effects than placebo. In summary, very few trials are under way, and most involve a small number of people. Limited available data do not provide enough evidence to support the use of antiglucocorticoid treatments for psychosis; additional trials are needed."""

This review updates an earlier version, first published in 2002. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of any type of antidepressant for patients who have been diagnosed as having dementia of any type and depression as defined by recognised criteria. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register, on 16 August 2017. ALOIS contains information on trials retrieved from databases and from a number of trial registers and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included all relevant double‐blind, randomised trials comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo, for patients diagnosed as having dementia and depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors selected studies for inclusion and extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. Where clinically appropriate, we pooled data for treatment periods up to three months and from three to nine months. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Main results We included ten studies with a total of 1592 patients. Eight included studies reported sufficiently detailed results to enter into analyses related to antidepressant efficacy. We split one study which included two different antidepressants and therefore had nine groups of patients treated with antidepressants compared with nine groups receiving placebo treatment. Information needed to make Risk of bias judgements was often missing. We found high‐quality evidence of little or no difference in scores on depression symptom rating scales between the antidepressant and placebo treated groups after 6 to 13 weeks (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.26 to 0.06; 614 participants; 8 studies). There was probably also little or no difference between groups after six to nine months (mean difference (MD) 0.59 point, 95% CI ‐1.12 to 2.3, 357 participants; 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence).

Moreover, it is particularly challenging to distinguish between pathological and normal reactions to such a severe illness. Depressive symptoms, even in subthreshold manifestations, have been shown to have a negative impact in terms of quality of life, compliance with anti‐cancer treatment, suicide risk and likely even the mortality rate for the cancer itself. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in this population are few and often report conflicting results.

Several unique clinical and psychosocial factors may contribute to the development and persistence of depression in PLWH. Given these influences, it is unclear if antidepressant therapy is as effective for PLWH as the general population. Objectives To assess the efficacy of antidepressant therapy for treatment of depression in PLWH. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Groups specialised register (CCMD‐CTR), the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and ran a cited reference search on the Web of Science for reports of all included studies. We conducted additional searches of the international trial registers including; ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization Trials Portal (ICTRP), and the HIV and AIDS ‐ Clinical trials register. We searched grey literature and reference lists to identify additional studies and contacted authors to obtain missing data. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches, which included studies conducted between 1 January 1980 and 18 April 2017. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials of antidepressant drug therapy compared to placebo or another antidepressant drug class. Participants eligible for inclusion had to be aged 18 years and older, from any setting, and have both HIV and depression. Depression was defined according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Statistical Classification of Diseases criteria. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We presented categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Continuous outcomes were presented mean (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with standard deviations (SD). We assessed quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 10 studies with 709 participants in this review. Of the 10 studies, eight were conducted in high income countries (USA and Italy), seven were conducted prior to 2000 and seven had predominantly men. Seven studies assessed antidepressants versus placebo, two compared different antidepressant classes and one had three arms comparing two antidepressant classes with placebo. Antidepressant therapy may result in a greater improvement in depression compared to placebo. There was a moderate improvement in depression when assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D) score as a continuous outcome (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.96; participants = 357; studies = 6; I 2  = 62%, low quality evidence). However, there was no evidence of improvement when this was assessed with HAM‐D score as a dichotomized outcome (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.35; participants = 434; studies = 5; I 2  = 0%, low quality evidence) or Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI‐I) score (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.77; participants = 346; studies = 4; I 2  = 29%, low quality evidence). There was little to no difference in the proportion of study dropouts between study arms (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.80; participants = 306; studies = 4; I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence). The methods of reporting adverse events varied substantially between studies, this resulted in very low quality evidence contributing to a pooled estimate (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21; participants = 167; studies = 2; I 2  = 34%; very low quality evidence). Based on this, we were unable to determine if there was a difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in the antidepressant versus placebo arms. However, sexual dysfunction was reported commonly in people receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). People receiving tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) frequently reported anticholinergic adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation. There were no reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in any study group. There was no evidence of a difference in follow‐up CD4 count at study termination (MD ‐6.31 cells/mm 3 , 95% CI ‐72.76 to 60.14; participants = 176; studies = 3; I 2  = 0%; low quality evidence). Only one study evaluated quality of life score (MD 3.60, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 7.58; participants = 87; studies = 1; very low quality evidence), due to the poor quality evidence we could not draw conclusions for this outcome. There were few studies comparing different antidepressant classes. We are uncertain if SSRIs differ from TCAs with regard to improvement in depression as evaluated by HAM‐D score (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐10.87 to 4.47; participants = 14; studies = 1; very low quality evidence). There was some evidence that mirtazapine resulted in a greater improvement in depression compared to an SSRI (MD 9.00, 95% CI 3.61 to 14.39; participants = 70; studies = 1; low quality evidence); however, this finding was not consistent for all measures of improvement in depression for this comparison. No studies reported on virological suppression or any other HIV specific outcomes. The studies included in this review had an overall unclear or high risk of bias due to under‐reporting of study methods, high risk of attrition bias and inadequate sequence generation methods. Heterogeneity between studies and the limited number of participants, and events lead to downgrading of the quality of the evidence for several outcomes. Authors conclusions This review demonstrates that antidepressant therapy may be more beneficial than placebo for the treatment of depression in PLWH. The low quality of the evidence contributing to this assessment and the lack of studies representing PLWH from generalized epidemics in low‐ to middle‐income countries make the relevance of these finding in todays context limited. Future studies that evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy should be designed and conducted rigorously. Such studies should incorporate evaluation of stepped care models and health system strengthening interventions in the study design. In addition, outcomes related to HIV care and antiretroviral therapy should be reported. Plain language summary Antidepressant drugs for treatment of depression in people living with HIV Why is this review important? Depression is very common among people living with HIV. There are many unique issues which influence the development and possibly the recovery from depression in this group. We are therefore uncertain whether the antidepressant drugs which are usually used to treat depression in people without HIV will be as effective in PLWH. Who will be interested in this review? PLWH, general practitioners, HIV clinicians and professionals working in mental health services. What questions does this review aim to answer? ‐ Are antidepressant medicines more effective than using a placebo (pretend treatment) for treatment of depression in PLWH? ‐ Do more people stop attending services (dropout) if they are receiving antidepressant medicines compared to placebos? ‐ Are there any serious side effects to antidepressant medicines which specifically affect PLWH? ‐ Which type of antidepressant medicine is most effective for depressed PLWH? ‐ Does treating depression with antidepressants in PLWH improve antiretroviral treatment outcomes among people also receiving HIV treatment? Which studies were included in the review? We searched several databases to find randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) which compared antidepressant therapy to placebo or other antidepressant drugs for treatment of depression in PLWH. Studies had to have been conducted between 1 January 1980 and 18 April 2017 to be included in the review. Ten studies with 709 participants were included. What does the evidence from the review tell us? Most studies were conducted more than a decade ago, in the USA, in predominantly men. We found that antidepressant therapy may improve depressive symptoms when compared to a placebo tablet. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of people who dropped out of care when comparing people who received antidepressants with people who received a placebo. We cannot be certain if one type of antidepressant works better than another. Side effects were very common among all study participants. Although there were no clear conclusions on which side effects were most common or if side effects occurred more frequently in people taking antidepressants compared to a placebo, participants receiving antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors did report sexual problems frequently. People receiving medicines called tricyclic antidepressants reported constipation and dry mouth frequently. No studies reported on how antidepressant therapy affected the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. The evidence used to generate several of the results was assessed as low or very low quality. What should happen next? The review authors recommend that new studies on treatment of depression should be conducted in countries and population groups where HIV is most common. These studies should evaluate what causes depression in these populations and how to best to incorporate antidepressant therapy with other strategies for the management of PLWH and depression."""

In spite of its high mortality, morbidity and chronicity, there are few intervention studies on the subject. Objectives The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of acute AN. Search methods The strategy comprised of database searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE (1966 to April 28th, 2005), EMBASE (1980 to week 36, 2004), PsycINFO (1969 to August week 5, 2004), handsearching the International Journal of Eating Disorders and searching the reference lists of all papers selected. Personal letters were sent to researchers in the field requesting information on unpublished or in‐progress trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of antidepressant treatment for AN patients, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM‐IV) or similar international criteria, were selected. Data collection and analysis Quality ratings were made giving consideration to the strong relationship between allocation concealment and potential for bias in the results; studies meeting criteria A and B were included. Trials were excluded if non‐completion rates were above 50%. The standardised mean difference and relative risk were used for continuous data and dichotomous data comparisons, respectively. Whenever possible, analyses were performed according to intention‐to‐treat principles. Heterogeneity was tested with the I‐squared statistic. Weight change was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were severity of eating disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms, and global clinical state. Acceptability of treatment was evaluated by considering non‐completion rates. Main results Only seven studies were included. Major methodological limitations such as small trial size and large confidence intervals decreased the power of the studies to detect differences between treatments, and meta‐analysis of data was not possible for the majority of outcomes. Four placebo‐controlled trials did not find evidence that antidepressants improved weight gain, eating disorder or associated psychopathology. Isolated findings, favouring amineptine and nortriptyline, emerged from the antidepressant versus antidepressant comparisons, but cannot be conceived as evidence of efficacy of a specific drug or class of antidepressant in light of the findings from the placebo comparisons. Non‐completion rates were similar between the compared groups. Authors conclusions A lack of quality information precludes us from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations on the use of antidepressants in acute AN. Future studies testing safer and more tolerable antidepressants in larger, well designed trials are needed to provide guidance for clinical practice.

Meta‐analysis of data was not possible for most outcomes. However, major methodological limitations of these studies (e.g. insufficient power to detect differences) prevent from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations for antidepressant use in acute AN.

Hypersalivation is a common side effect when people with schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs. Hypersalivation can be an embarrassing and stigmatising problem, can affect quality of life and can result in discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment. It can also be difficult to treat. Objectives To summarise the best available evidence of the effects of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of non‐clozapine neuroleptic‐induced hypersalivation in people with schizophrenia. Clozapine‐induced hypersalivation has been addressed in another Cochrane review. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (15 November 2012) and inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant studies. We were to contact the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing an anticholinergic drug with placebo, no treatment, another anticholinergic drug or any other intervention. Data collection and analysis We inspected the results of the search to identify relevant studies. We were to extract data onto standard, simple forms. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane risk assessment tool. For binary outcomes, we were to calculate a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we were to estimate the mean difference between groups. Main results The search resulted in four potential studies; after inspection, all were excluded. Three studies were excluded because they involved people with clozapine‐induced hypersalivation ‐ a topic covered in another Cochrane review. The fourth study was excluded because it involved people with schizophrenia, mood disorders or other mental disorders who were suffering from clozapine‐ and non‐clozapine induced hypersalivation and were treated with Chinese medicines with unknown anticholinergic properties. People in the control group received an anticholinergic drug (artane) or an antihistamine (phenergan). It was not possible to separate clozapine‐ from non‐clozapine‐treated people in the intervention group, or to separate artane‐treated people from phenergan‐treated people in the control group. Authors conclusions We have been unable to locate any studies addressing the question raised in this review. Accordingly, this empty review points out an important clinical problem that needs to be investigated via well‐designed and well‐conducted randomised trials. Clinicians and patients are likely to continue with their current dependence on clinical judgement and personal experience. Policy makers have no trial‐based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of hypersalivation induced by neuroleptics other than clozapine. They are likely to continue to rely on opinion and habit when making recommendations. Funders of studies may wish to make this important subgroup of people a priority in future research. Plain language summary Anticholinergic medication for excessive salivation caused by use of antipsychotics other than clozapine The first line of treatment of schizophrenia is usually antipsychotic drugs. These drugs help in the treatment of the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. However, these drugs often have serious side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, tiredness, apathy and lack of drive. Dribbling or drooling (hypersalivation) is another common side effect, which frequently occurs at night when asleep. This can be an embarrassing and stigmatising problem that can affect quality of life and cause people to stop their medication, which may result in relapse and going back into hospital. Dribbling and drooling can be difficult to treat; however, anticholinergic drugs can decrease production of saliva and dribbling. This review assessed the evidence for the benefit or harm of anticholinergic drugs used in treating hypersalivation caused by antipsychotic or neuroleptic medication. The review excluded the antipsychotic clozapine, as its role in causing hypersalivation has been the subject of another Cochrane review. The search was carried out 15 November 2012 and resulted in identification of four potential studies, but none could be included. Three of these were excluded because they involved clozapine‐related hypersalivation. The fourth study was excluded because it involved people with mood or other mental disorders and Chinese medicines. Dribbling or hypersalivation is an important problem that needs to be investigated via well‐designed research and randomised trials. Until such time, psychiatrists and patients are likely to continue their treatment of hypersalivation on the basis of daily clinical judgement and personal experience rather than hard evidence. Treatment of hypersalivation caused by antipsychotics or neuroleptics other than clozapine does not seem to have received adequate research attention to help guide practice. The review authors conclude that using anticholinergics to treat dribbling or hypersalivation caused by antipsychotic drugs other than clozapine cannot be justified without further study.

Because of this, many people treated with antipsychotic medication also receive anticholinergic drugs in order to reduce some of the associated movement side‐effects. However, there is also a suggestion from animal experiments that the chronic administration of anticholinergics could cause tardive dyskinesia. Objectives To determine whether the use or the withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs (benzhexol, benztropine, biperiden, orphenadrine, procyclidine, scopolamine, or trihexylphenidyl) are clinically effective for the treatment of people with both antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses. Search methods We retrieved 712 references from searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Study‐Based Register of Trials including the registries of clinical trials (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017). We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria We included reports identified in the search if they were controlled trials dealing with people with antipsychotic‐induced tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness who had been randomly allocated to (a) anticholinergic medication versus placebo (or no intervention), (b) anticholinergic medication versus any other intervention for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, or (c) withdrawal of anticholinergic medication versus continuation of anticholinergic medication. Data collection and analysis We independently extracted data from included trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. Main results The previous version of this review included no trials. We identified two trials that could be included from the 2015 and 2017 searches. They randomised 30 in‐ and outpatients with schizophrenia in the USA and Germany. Overall, the risk of bias was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting"""

Amisulpride is said to be an ""atypical"" antipsychotic which induces less movement disorder and which is effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of amisulpride as compared with placebo, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. Search methods The authors carried out electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982‐1999), CINAHL (1982‐1999), Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group\s Register (November 2000), EMBASE (1980‐1999), LILACS(1982‐1999), MEDLINE (1966‐1999) and PsycLIT (1974‐1999). They checked all identified studies for further trial citations, and sought these studies in the Science Citation Index. They also contacted authors of trials and the manufacturer of amisulpride. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials comparing amisulpride to placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia or other non‐affective serious mental illnesses. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted and analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of dichotomous data were calculated using a random effects model, and, where possible, the number needed to treat was calculated. Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for continuous data. Main results This review currently includes 19 randomised studies with a total of 2443 participants. Most trials were of short duration. Data from 4 trials with 514 participants with predominantly negative symptoms suggest that low‐dose (up to 300mg/day) amisulpride was a more acceptable treatment than placebo (n=514, RR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 3 to 7), it was superior in the improvement of the participants\ global state (n=242, RR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6) and in the treatment of negative symptoms (n=167, WMD ‐10.00 CI ‐17.16 to ‐2.84). Compared to typical antipsychotics, the pooled results of a total of fourteen trials suggest that amisulpride was more effective in improving global state (n=651, RR 0.7 CI 0.5 to 0.9, NNT 6 CI 4 to 11), the general mental state (n=695, WMD ‐4.2 CI ‐6.5 to ‐1.9) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (n=506, WMD ‐2.8 CI ‐4.3 to ‐1.3). Regarding positive symptoms, amisulpride was as effective as typical antipsychotics. Amisulpride was less prone to cause at least one general adverse event (n=751, RR 0.9 CI 0.8 to 0.97, NNH 9 CI 6 to 18), one extrapyramidal symptom (n=771, RR 0.7 CI 0.6 to 0.9, NNH 5 CI 4 to 9) or to require the use of antiparkinson medication (n=851, RR 0.6 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNH 4 CI 3 to 6). No clear differences in other adverse events compared to typical drugs were found. Amisulpride also seemed to be more acceptable than conventional drugs as measured by the outcome \leaving the studies early\ (n=1512, RR 0.8 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 16 CI 9 to 69) than conventional drugs, but this result might have been overestimated due to a publication bias which could not be excluded with certainty. A single trial compared amisulpride to another \atypical\ antipsychotic, risperidone. With the exception of agitation, which was more frequent in the amisulpride group (n=228, RR 3.4 CI 1.2 to 10.1, NNH 11 CI 6 to 50) no significant differences were recorded on efficacy or acceptability. Authors\ conclusions This systematic review confirms that amisulpride is an effective \atypical\ antipsychotic drug for those with schizophrenia. Amisulpride may offer a good general profile, at least compared to high‐potency \typical\ antipsychotics. It may also yield better results in some specific outcomes related to efficacy, such as improvement of global state and general negative symptoms. It might be more acceptable and more tolerable than high‐potency conventional antipsychotics, especially regarding extrapyramidal side‐effects. \u2028 \u2028 Longer term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the comparative value of amisulpride, particularly compared to other expensive atypical antipsychotics. These should focus on important outcomes which have not been sufficiently monitored such as service use, family burden and quality of life. Plain language summary Amisulpride for schizophrenia Amisulpride is a new antipsychotic compound. This review suggests that it is more effective than a placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia. Amisulpride also has some advantages for the treatment of the general and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and it is associated with less movement disorder than high‐potency conventional drugs. In terms of other side‐effects, no relevant differences were found."

Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of mental health services providing specialist care, beyond the scope of generic outpatient provision, as an alternative to inpatient mental health care, for children or adolescents aged from five to 18 years who have a serious mental health condition requiring specialist services beyond the capacity of generic outpatient provision. The control group received mental health services in an inpatient or equivalent setting. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We grouped studies according to the intervention type but did not pool data because of differences in the interventions and measures of outcome. Where data were available we calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between groups at follow up. We also calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs for each outcome in terms of mean change from baseline to follow up using the follow‐up SDs. We calculated SMDs (taking into account the direction of change and the scoring of each instrument) so that negative SMDs indicate results that favour treatment and positive SMDs favour the control group.

Protecting the central nervous system against these damaging mechanisms may be a useful therapeutic approach. Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an endogenous antioxidant that interrupts cellular oxidative processes in both its oxidized and reduced forms. These properties might qualify ALA for a modulatory role in the treatment of people with dementia.

Data collection and analysis No trials were found that met the selection criteria Main results No meta‐analysis could be performed. A systematic search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, as well as registers of ongoing and unpublished trials, could not identify any studies investigating the use of ALA for dementia. Authors conclusions In the absence of randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials investigating ALA for dementia, no evidence exists to explore any potential effects. Until data from trials become available for analysis, ALA cannot be recommended for people with dementia. Plain language summary No evidence of efficacy of alpha lipoic acid for dementia Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is one of a number of potent antioxidants for which a potential therapeutic role in dementia has been postulated. This suggestion arises from the possibility that oxidative and inflammatory processes contribute to the neurodegeneration of Alzheimers disease. Whilst ALA has been used as part of the treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, no placebo‐controlled randomized trials have been conducted for its use in degenerative dementias. ALA for the treatment of dementia of any subtype cannot currently be recommended."""

They have been used in end‐of‐life settings to direct care but should be well suited to the mental health setting. Objectives To examine the effects of advance treatment directives for people with severe mental illness. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (February 2008), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1 2008), BIOSIS (1985 to February 2008), CINAHL (1982 to February 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), PsycINFO (1872 to February 2008), as well as SCISEARCH and Google ‐ Internet search engine (February 2008). We inspected relevant references and contacted first authors of included studies. We updated this search on 17 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving adults with severe mental illness, comparing any form of advance directive with standard care for health service and clinical outcomes. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed‐effect relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence interval again using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We were able to include two trials involving 321 people with severe mental illnesses. There was no significant difference in hospital admission (n=160, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 0.5 to 1.0), or number of psychiatric outpatient attendances between participants given advanced treatment directives or usual care. Similarly, no significant differences were found for compliance with treatment, self harm or number of arrests. Participants given advanced treatment directives needed less use of social workers time (n=160, 1 RCT, WMD ‐106.00 CI ‐156.2 to ‐55.8) than the usual care group, and violent acts were also lower in the advanced directives group (n=160, 1 RCT, RR 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 8 CI 6 to 92). The number of people leaving the study early were not different between groups (n=321, 2 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.6 to 1.6). The addition of 11 studies to awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Authors conclusions There are too few data available to make definitive recommendations. More intensive forms of advance directive appear to show promise, but currently practice must be guided by evidence other than that derived from randomised trials. More trials are indicated to determine whether higher intensity interventions, such as joint crisis planning, have an effect on outcomes of clinical relevance. Plain language summary Advance treatment directives for people with severe mental illness An advance treatment directive is a document that specifies a person’s future preferences for treatment, should he or she lose the mental ability to make treatment decisions (lose capacity). They have traditionally been used to stipulate treatment in end‐of‐life situations. However, people with mental health problems can also have periods where they are unable to make treatment decisions, and an advance statement could help with choosing suitable medication, saying who should look after children and specifying choices in other areas of their life and treatment. This review looks at whether having an advance statement leads to less hospitalisation (either voluntary or involuntary), less contact with mental health services and whether there is an improvement in general functioning. Two studies were found, involving 321 people. Both took place in England. One trial involved the person concerned making a joint crisis plan in collaboration with the psychiatrist, care coordinator and project worker (high intensity), while the other required filling in a booklet called ‘preferences for care’ (low intensity). Both studies were compared to the usual care in the area concerned. Since the interventions were quite different, and not all outcomes were measured by both studies, it is quite difficult to compare the trials. Those who filled in the booklet showed no decrease in admission to hospital (voluntary or involuntary) or contact with out‐patient services, when compared to usual care. The high intensity group showed no differences in voluntary admissions compared to those in usual care, but were less likely to be hospitalised involuntarily, or assessed under the Mental Health Act. They were also less likely to be violent. There was no difference in use of psychiatric out‐patient services by those in the intervention groups. These are small studies and more research is needed, but it is suggested that using an advance treatment directive could be an alternative to community treatment orders. \u2028 \u2028 (Plain language summary prepared for this review by Janey Antoniou of RETHINK, UK  www.rethink.org )"""

Antidepressants are taken by approximately 30% of people with IBD. However, there are no current guidelines on treating co‐morbid anxiety and depression in people with IBD with antidepressants, nor are there clear data on the role of antidepressants in managing physical symptoms of IBD. Objectives The objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for treating anxiety and depression in IBD, and to assess the effects of antidepressants on quality of life (QoL) and managing disease activity in IBD. Search methods We searched MEDLINE; Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 23 August 2018. Reference lists, trials registers, conference proceedings and grey literature were also searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing any type of antidepressant to placebo, no treatment or an active therapy for IBD were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We used the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale to assess quality of observational studies. GRADE was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes. Primary outcomes included anxiety and depression. Anxiety was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) or the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Depression was assessed using HADS or the Beck Depression Inventory. Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, withdrawal due to AEs, quality of life (QoL), clinical remission, relapse, pain, hospital admissions, surgery, and need for steroid treatment. QoL was assessed using the WHO‐QOL‐BREF questionnaire. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. A fixed‐effect model was used for analysis. Main results We included four studies (188 participants). Two studies were double‐blind RCTs, one was a non‐randomised controlled trial, and one was an observational retrospective case‐matched study. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had quiescent IBD and in one study participants had active or quiescent IBD. Participants in one study had co‐morbid anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants in clinical ranges. Three studies had placebo controls and one study had a no treatment control group. One RCT was rated as low risk of bias and the other was rated as high risk of bias (incomplete outcome data). The non‐randomised controlled trial was rated as high risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding). The observational study was rated as high methodological quality, but is still considered to be at high risk of bias given its observational design. The effect of antidepressants on anxiety and depression is uncertain. At 12 weeks, the mean anxiety score in antidepressant participants was 6.11  +  3 compared to 8.5  +  3.45 in placebo participants (MD ‐2.39, 95% ‐4.30 to ‐0.48, 44 participants, low certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean anxiety score in antidepressant participants was 3.8  +  2.5 compared to 4.2  +  4.9 in placebo participants (MD ‐0.40, 95% ‐3.47 to 2.67, 26 participants; low certainty evidence). At 12 weeks, the mean depression score in antidepressant participants was 7.47  +  2.42 compared to 10.5  +  3.57 in placebo participants (MD ‐3.03, 95% CI ‐4.83 to ‐1.23, 44 participants; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean depression score in antidepressant participants was 2.9  +  2.8 compared to 3.1  +  3.4 in placebo participants (MD ‐0.20, 95% ‐2.62 to 2.22, 26 participants; low certainty evidence). The effect of antidepressants on AEs is uncertain. Fifty‐seven per cent (8/14) of antidepressant participants group reported AEs versus 25% (3/12) of placebo participants (RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.78 to 6.73, low certainty evidence). Commonly reported AEs include nausea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual problems, insomnia, fatigue, low mood/anxiety, dry mouth, muscle spasms and hot flushes. None of the included studies reported any serious AEs. None of the included studies reported on pain. One study (44 participants) reported on QoL at 12 weeks and another study (26 participants) reported on QoL at 12 months. Physical, Psychological, Social and Environmental QoL were improved at 12 weeks compared to placebo (all low certainty evidence). There were no group differences in QoL at 12 months (all low certainty evidence). The effect of antidepressants on maintenance of clinical remission and endoscopic relapse is uncertain. At 12 months, 64% (9/14) of participants in the antidepressant group maintained clinical remission compared to 67% (8/12) of placebo participants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.69; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, none (0/30) of participants in the antidepressant group had endoscopic relapse compared to 10% (3/30) of placebo participants (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.65; very low certainty evidence). Authors conclusions The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in IBD can be drawn. Future studies should employ RCT designs, with a longer follow‐up and develop solutions to address attrition. Inclusion of objective markers of disease activity is strongly recommended as is testing antidepressants from different classes, as at present it is unclear if any antidepressant (or class thereof) has differential efficacy. Plain language summary Antidepressants for inflammatory bowel disease What is inflammatory bowel disease? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract (colon or small intestine or both). IBD predominantly comprises Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. Symptoms of IBD include diarrhoea, urgency of defecation (including faecal incontinence), abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fatigue and weight loss. When people experience symptoms of IBD they are considered to have active disease. When symptoms of IBD stop the disease is in remission. IBD is associated with a psycho‐social burden, with rates of depression in people with IBD twice as high as in the general population. Anxiety and depression which accompany IBD may be associated with poor quality of life, worsening IBD activity, higher hospitalisation rates and lower adherence to treatment. Up to 30% of people living with IBD take antidepressants which are prescribed for either mental health or bowel symptoms or both. What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are drugs used to treat depression and other mental disorders such as anxiety. No antidepressants are currently approved by regulatory agencies for specifically treating anxiety and depression, to manage physical symptoms or to reduce bowel inflammation in people with IBD. However, some antidepressants have indications for treatment of pain in chronic conditions and have been commonly used to manage functional bowel symptoms in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. What did the researchers investigate? Previously conducted studies of antidepressant therapy in IBD were reviewed. The data from some of these studies were combined using a method called a meta‐analysis. During the analysis, people who took antidepressants were compared with those who did not take antidepressants with regard to rates of anxiety and depression and also other measures such as quality of life, side effects and IBD disease activity. What did the researchers find? The researchers searched the medical literature up to 23 August 2018. Four published studies, including a total of 188 people, examined antidepressant therapy in people with IBD. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had IBD in remission and in one study participants had either active IBD or IBD in remission. Participants in one study had co‐existing anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants. Three studies had a placebo (e.g. sugar pill) control group and one study had a no treatment control group. The analysis showed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression were improved in those who took antidepressants compared to placebo. Participants who received antidepressants experienced more side effects than those who received placebo. Side effects reported by those taking antidepressants included"""

It is accessible and inexpensive, at least in China, and is likely to be widely used there for psychotic symptoms. Objectives To review the effects of acupuncture, alone or in combination treatments compared with placebo (or no treatment) or any other treatments for people with schizophrenia or related psychoses. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (February 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and clinical trials registries. We also inspected references of identified studies and contacted relevant authors for additional information. Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised controlled trials involving people with schizophrenia‐like illnesses, comparing acupuncture added to standard dose antipsychotics with standard dose antipsychotics alone, acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics with standard dose antipsychotics, acupuncture with antipsychotics, acupuncture added to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) drug with TCM drug, acupuncture with TCM drug, electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy. Data collection and analysis We reliably extracted data from all included studies, discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and contacted authors of studies when necessary. We analysed binary outcomes using a standard estimation of risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences with 95% CI. For homogeneous data we used fixed‐effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created Summary of findings tables using GRADE. Main results After an update search in 2012 the review now includes 30 studies testing different forms of acupuncture across six different comparisons. All studies were at moderate risk of bias. When acupuncture plus standard antipsychotic treatment was compared with standard antipsychotic treatment alone, people were at less risk of being not improved (n = 244, 3 RCTs, medium‐term RR 0.40 CI 0.28 to 0.57,  very low quality evidence ). Mental state findings were mostly consistent with this finding as was time in hospital (n = 120, 1 RCT, days MD ‐16.00 CI ‐19.54 to ‐12.46,  moderate quality evidence ). If anything, adverse effects were less for the acupuncture group (e.g. central nervous system, insomnia, short‐term, n = 202, 3 RCTs, RR 0.30 CI 0.11 to 0.83,  low quality evidence ). When acupuncture was added to low dose antipsychotics and this was compared with standard dose antipsychotic drugs, relapse was less in the experimental group (n = 170, 1 RCT, long‐term RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.89,  very low quality evidence ) but there was no difference for the outcome of not improved. Again, mental state findings were mostly consistent with the latter. Incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms ‐ akathisia, were less for those in the acupuncture added to low dose antipsychotics group (n = 180, 1 RCT, short‐term RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.49,  low quality evidence ) ‐ as dry mouth, blurred vision and tachycardia. When acupuncture was compared with antipsychotic drugs of known efficacy in standard doses, there were equivocal data for outcomes such as not improved using different global state criteria. Traditional acupuncture added to TCM drug had benefit over use of TCM drug alone (n = 360, 2 RCTs, RR no clinically important change 0.11 CI 0.02 to 0.59,  low quality evidence ), but when traditional acupuncture was compared with TCM drug directly there was no significant difference in the short‐term. However, we found that participants given electroacupuncture were significantly less likely to experience a worsening in global state (n = 88, 1 RCT, short‐term RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80,  low quality evidence ). In the one study that compared electric acupuncture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy there were significantly different rates of spinal fracture between the groups (n = 68, 1 RCT, short‐term RR 0.33 CI 0.14 to 0.81,  low quality evidence ). Attrition in all studies was minimal. No studies reported death, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, or economic outcomes. Authors conclusions Limited evidence suggests that acupuncture may have some antipsychotic effects as measured on global and mental state with few adverse effects. Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of acupuncture for people with schizophrenia. Plain language summary Acupuncture for schizophrenia Although acupuncture or Traditional Chinese Medicine has been practised for over 2000 years in China and the Far East, especially in Korea and Japan, it is a relatively new form of treament for physical and psychological conditions in the West. Acupuncture inserts needles into the skin to stimulate specific points of the body (acupoints). The aim is to achieve balance and harmony of the body. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness and is usually treated using antipsychotic medication. However, although effective, antipsychotic medication can cause side‐effects (such as sleepiness, weight gain and even dribbling). Acupuncture has been shown to have very few negative effects on the individual and could be more socially acceptable and tolerable for people with mental health problems. Acupuncture may also be less expensive than drugs made by pharmaceutical companies, so reducing costs to individuals and health services. This reviews looks at the effectiveness of various types of acupuncture as treatment for people with schizophrenia. An update search for studies was carried out in 2012 and found 30 studies that randomised participants who were receiving antipsychotic medication to receive additional acupuncture or standard care. Although some of the studies did favour acupuncture when combined with antipsychotics, the information available was small scale and rated to be very low or low quality by the review authors, so not completely provable and valid. Depression was reduced when combining acupuncture with antipsychotic medication, but again this finding came from small‐scale research, so cannot be clearly shown to be true. The review concludes that people with mental health problems, policy makers and health professionals need much better evidence in order to establish if there are any potential benefits to acupuncture. This means that the question of whether acupuncture is of benefit to people, and whether it is of greater benefit than antipsychotic medication, remains unanswered. There is not enough information to establish that acupuncture is of benefit or harm to people with mental health problems.

Various pathological processes are linked to memory impairment in dementia, particularly those affecting the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. Acetyl‐l‐carnitine (ALC) is derived from carnitine and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial in dementia. These include activity at cholinergic neurons, membrane stabilization and enhancing mitochondrial function. Work on the effects of ALC has been ongoing since the 1980s yet the mechanism of efficacy of ALC in cognitive decline remains unclear. Early studies suggested a beneficial effect of ALC on cognition and behaviour in aging subjects. However, later, larger studies have not supported these findings. Some of the difficulties lie in the differences in methodology and assessment tools used in the early and later studies. They are therefore difficult to compare. ALC is not currently in routine clinical use. Objectives To establish whether Acetyl‐l‐carnitine is clinically effective in the treatment of people with dementia. Search methods The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,  The Cochrane Library , EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS on 8 November using the terms acetyl‐l‐carnitine, l‐carnitine acetyl ester, acetylcarnitine, ALC. The search in November 2007 revealed no new studies. Selection criteria All double‐blind, randomized, trials involving people with dementia in which treatment with ALC was compared with a placebo group Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by a reviewer (SH) and entered into RevMan 4.2 software. Where possible intention‐to‐treat data were used, but most of the analyses were of completers (people who completed the study). Main results There are sixteen included trials, all of which included participants with mild‐moderate dementia or cognitive decline. All trials assessed the cognitive effects of ALC and in addition most considered severity of dementia, functional ability and clinical global impression. \u2028 When considering clinical global impression (CGI‐I) as a dichotomous variable (numbers improved versus numbers unchanged or worse) there were statistically significant treatment effects in favour of ALC at 12 and 24 weeks, (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.90, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.76) and (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.14) but not at 52 weeks (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.43). There was also a statistically significant treatment effect on MMSE at 24 weeks (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.69, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.29, P = 0.02), but not at 12 or 52 weeks. There was no evidence of benefit of ALC in the areas of severity of dementia, functional ability or Clinical Global Impression as a continuous measure. \u2028 Various adverse events were reported, but from the meta‐analyses there were no statistically significant differences between treated and placebo groups. Authors conclusions There is evidence for benefit of ALC on clinical global impression as a categorical measure and on MMSE at 24 weeks, but there is no evidence using objective assessments in any other area of outcome. Given the large number of comparisons made, the statistically significant results may be due to chance. At present there is no evidence to recommend its routine use in clinical practice. Many of the trials used rather vague descriptions of dementia and trials using more strictly defined groups may be informative. Individual patient data may add to the findings, as would trials including other outcomes (e.g. mood and caregiver quality of life). However, the evidence does not suggest that ALC is likely to prove an important therapeutic agent. More work on the pharmacokinetics of ALC in humans is also required. Plain language summary No evidence of benefit of Acetyl‐l‐carnitine for dementia Acetyl‐l‐carnitine (ALC) is derived from carnitine and is described as having several properties which may be beneficial in dementia. Early studies suggested a beneficial effect of ALC on cognition and behaviour in aging subjects. However, later, larger studies have not supported these findings. The early and later studies differ widely in methodology and assessment tools used, and are therefore difficult to compare. There is no evidence of benefit of ALC in the areas of cognition, severity of dementia, functional ability or Clinical Global Impression as a continuous measure. An apparent beneficial effect on Clinical Global Impression assessed as a dichotomous variable may be due to chance. There was also a significant treatment effect on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 24 weeks, but this result must be interpreted with caution in the context of significant heterogeneity in these trials. ALC is not currently in routine clinical use."""

Using aspirin as an adjunct (add‐on) treatment to antipsychotics or as a stand‐alone treatment could be a novel, relatively inexpensive option for people with schizophrenia. Objectives To review the effects of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as adjunct (add‐on) or as stand‐alone treatment for people with schizophrenia.
