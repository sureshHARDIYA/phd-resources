        <ab>BACKGROUND: Particulate air pollutionâ€™s physical health effects are well known, but associations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and mental illness have not yet been established. However, there is increasing interest in emerging evidence supporting a possible etiological link. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of the epidemiological literature to date by investigating quantitative associations between PM and multiple adverse mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or suicide). METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from January 1974 to September 2017 for English-language human observational studies reporting quantitative associations between exposure to PM &lt;1.0 μm in aerodynamic diameter (ultrafine particles) and PM &lt;2.5 and &lt;10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively) and the above psychiatric outcomes. We extracted data, appraised study quality using a published quality assessment tool, summarized methodological approaches, and conducted meta-analyses where appropriate. RESULTS: Of 1,826 citations identified, 22 met our overall inclusion criteria, and we included 9 in our primary meta-analyses. In our meta-analysis of associations between long-term (&gt;6 months) PM2.5 exposure and depression (n=5 studies), the pooled odds ratio was 1.102 per 10-μg/m³PM2.5 increase (95% CI: 1.023, 1.189; I²=0.00%). Two of the included studies investigating associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and anxiety also reported statistically significant positive associations, and we found a statistically significant association between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide in meta-analysis at a 0-2 d cumulative exposure lag. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the hypothesis of an association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and depression, as well as supporting hypotheses of possible associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and anxiety and between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide. The limited literature and methodological challenges in this field, including heterogeneous outcome definitions, exposure assessment, and residual confounding, suggest further high-quality studies are warranted to investigate potentially causal associations between air pollution and poor mental health.</ab>

        <ab>Objective To investigate patterns of mental health service and antipsychotic use following a first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and to examine the role of the treatment setting in which individuals are first diagnosed. Method Analysis of de-identified administrative claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse was used to identify 1450 privately insured youth and young adults aged 14 through 30 with FES from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015. Regression analysis was used to estimate the use of mental health services during the year following FES, by type of service and by site of index diagnosis. Results In the year following FES, 79.7% of youth received outpatient mental health services and 35.8% filled a prescription for antipsychotic medication. Among service users, mean outpatient visits were 15.9 and mean antipsychotic fills were 8.3. Youth who received an index diagnosis of FES in an inpatient setting were more likely to fill an antipsychotic medication than youth with FES in other settings. Youth who received an index diagnosis of FES during a specialty mental health outpatient visit had greater use of outpatient mental health than youth who received their diagnosis during a primary care visit. Conclusions Despite evidence-based guidelines supporting outpatient psychosocial care and antipsychotic treatment for FES, one-fifth of this cohort did not use outpatient services and the majority did not fill any prescriptions for antipsychotic medications during the year following FES. Our findings provide renewed urgency to ongoing efforts to accelerate early identification and care coordination for youth with FES.</ab>

        <ab>Background Middle-Eastern immigrants in Sweden are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and poor mental health. Physical activity not only prevents/delays onset of T2D but also shows favorable effects on mental health. However, the effects of a culturally adapted lifestyle intervention on mental health among Middle-Eastern immigrants have not been explored before. We aimed to study the effects of a randomized controlled, culturally adapted lifestyle intervention on anxiety and depression levels in diabetes-prone Iraqi immigrants. Methods Participants (n = 96) were randomized to intervention group, IG (n = 50) or control group, CG (n = 46). The IG received seven group sessions addressing lifestyle change and the CG received treatment as usual. Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessed mental health at start, mid (2 months) and end of the study (4 months). Proportional odds ratio (OR) model was used to study the effect of the intervention. Results The odds of scoring lower on MADRS-S and HADS depression scale at visit 3 vs. baseline were higher in the IG compared to the CG (MADRS-S OR 5.9, 95% CI: 1.6–22.5; HADS OR 4.4, 95% CI: 0.9–20.3). The findings persisted after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, time since migration, sedentary lifestyle and language spoken at home. Group differences were non-significant at visit 2 vs. baseline. Conclusion A culturally adapted lifestyle intervention addressing T2D prevention in Middle-Eastern immigrants has favorable effects on mental health. The effect was more pronounced at the 4 months than at 2 months follow-up, indicating beneficial effect of longer study duration. Trial registration www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01420198.</ab>

        <ab>Background: White matter network alterations have increasingly been implicated in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to identify shared and distinct white matter network alterations among the 3 disorders. Methods: We used analysis of covariance, with age and gender as covariates, to investigate white matter network alterations in 123 patients with schizophrenia, 123 with bipolar disorder, 124 with major depressive disorder and 209 healthy controls. Results: We found significant group differences in global network efficiency (F = 3.386, p = 0.018), nodal efficiency (F = 8.015, p &lt; 0.001 corrected for false discovery rate [FDR]) and nodal degree (F = 5.971, p FDR &lt; 0.001) in the left middle occipital gyrus, as well as nodal efficiency (F = 6.930, p FDR &lt; 0.001) and nodal degree (F = 5.884, p FDR &lt; 0.001) in the left postcentral gyrus. We found no significant alterations in patients with major depressive disorder. Post hoc analyses revealed that compared with healthy controls, patients in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups showed decreased global network efficiency, nodal efficiency and nodal degree in the left middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, patients in the schizophrenia group showed decreased nodal efficiency and nodal degree in the left postcentral gyrus compared with healthy controls. Limitations: Our findings could have been confounded in part by treatment differences. Conclusion: Our findings implicate graded white matter network alterations across the 3 disorders, enhancing our understanding of shared and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms across diagnoses and providing vital insights into neuroimaging-based methods for diagnosis and research.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: While medical student wellness has been a subject of recent study and discussion, current efforts may fail to address possible underlying, harmful cognitive distortions regarding academic performance. The authors sought to examine dysfunctional thoughts (maladaptive perfectionism, impostor phenomenon) and negative feelings (shame, embarrassment, inadequacy) that may contribute to poor mental health in pre-clinical medical students.Methods: A survey was administered to first-year medical students at Saint Louis University that included assessments for maladaptive perfectionism, impostor phenomenon, depression, and anxiety, as well as questions about feelings of shame, embarrassment, inadequacy, comparison, and self-worth.Results: A total of 169 students (93%) participated. Students who met criteria for maladaptive perfectionism were significantly more likely to report greater feelings of shame/embarrassment and inadequacy (P &lt; 0.001) than their peers who did not; similar associations were observed in students who reported high/intense levels of impostor phenomenon (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, students who reported feelings of shame/embarrassment or inadequacy were significantly more likely to report moderate/severe levels of depression symptoms (P &lt; 0.001) and moderate/high levels of anxiety symptoms (P = 0.001) relative to students who did not report these negative feelings.Conclusions: These preliminary data support a model for how negative thoughts may lead to negative emotions, and depression and anxiety in medical students. The authors propose strategies for preventive interventions in medical school beginning in orientation. Further research is needed to develop targeted interventions to promote student mental health through reduction of cognitive distortions and negative feelings of shame, embarrassment, and inadequacy.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Despite the risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated comorbidities after physical injury, few emergency departments (EDs) in the United States screen for the presence of psychological symptoms and conditions. Barriers to systematic screening could be overcome by using a tool that is both comprehensive and brief. This study aimed to determine 1) the feasibility of screening for posttraumatic sequelae among adults with minor injury in the ED and 2) the relationship between ED screening and later psychological symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL) at 6 weeks postinjury. Methods: In the EDs of two Level I trauma centers, we enrolled injured patients (n = 149) who reported serious injury and/or life threat in the past 24 hours. Subjects completed the Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale (PAS) to screen for PTSD and depression in the ED, and 6 weeks later they completed assessments for symptoms of PTSD, depression, and trauma‐specific QOL (T‐QoL). Results: Our retained sample at 6 weeks was 84 adults (51.2% male; mean ± SD age = 33 ± 11.88 years); 38% screened positive for PTSD, and 76% screened positive for depression in the ED. Controlling for age, hospital admission, and ED pain score, regression analyses revealed that a positive ED screen for both PTSD and depression was significantly associated with 6 weeks PTSD (p = 0.027, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 15.14) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.001, 95% CI = 2.20 to 7.74), respectively. Further, a positive ED screen for depression (p = 0.043, 95% CI = –16.66 to –0.27) and PTSD (p = 0.015, 95% CI = –20.35 to –2.24) was significantly associated with lower T‐QoL. Conclusions: These results suggest that it is feasible to identify patients at risk for postinjury sequelae in the ED; screening for mental health risk may identify patients in need of early intervention and further monitoring.</ab>

        <ab>Aims Treatment of patients with comorbidity of mental health problems and alcohol use disorder (AUD) constitutes a challenge in many countries. The article aimed at exploration of personal experiences of clinicians and patients with the comorbidity regarding its assessment, treatment and organization of care in Poland and the UK. Methods Data were collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews with clinicians (N = 28) and patients (N = 81) in both countries, according to a unified study protocol. Maximum variation sampling was applied to both study groups. All interviews' transcripts were coded (CAQDA) and the consistency of coding across centres was assessed. Data analysis was performed according to the principles of thematic analysis. Results Our data show that most patients with AUD admitted at the psychiatric wards—apart from assessment which is a standard procedure during admission—receive only minimal support during their hospital stay. This is the consequence of two factors: lack of trained staff prepared to help those patients and a priority given to self-referrals by AUD units. At the same time, it is recognized by clinicians and patients that more support is needed to encourage the utilization of AUD services and to prevent the drop-out. Conclusions In order to improve the system response, the use of screening instruments in the process of the assessment of AUD and establishment of special procedures supporting motivation and adherence to treatment and preventing drop-out merits consideration. Moreover, the psychiatric wards and the AUD services could possibly profit from formalization of the collaboration between services.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This repeated cross-sectional survey study was conducted to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, burnout, distress, and depression among anesthesiology residents and first-year graduates. We hypothesized that heavy workload and student debt burden were associated with a higher risk of physician burnout, distress, and depression, and that perception of having adequate workplace resources, work-life balance, and social support were associated with a lower risk.Methods: Physicians beginning U.S. anesthesiology residency between 2013 and 2016 were invited to take online surveys annually from their clinical anesthesia year 1 to 1 yr after residency graduation. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Physician Well-Being Index, and the Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National Depression Screening Day Scale were used to measure burnout, distress, and depression, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether self-reported demographics, personal, and professional factors were associated with the risk of burnout, distress, and depression.Results: The response rate was 36% (5,295 of 14,529). The prevalence of burnout, distress, and depression was 51% (2,531 of 4,966), 32% (1,575 of 4,941), and 12% (565 of 4,840), respectively. Factors associated with a lower risk of all three outcomes included respondents' perceived workplace resource availability, (odds ratio = 0.51 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.57] for burnout; 0.51 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.56] for distress; 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.60] for depression) and perceived ability to maintain work-life balance (0.61 [95% CI, 0.56 to 0.67] for burnout; 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.55] for distress; 0.58 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.65] for depression). A greater number of hours worked per week and a higher amount of student debt were associated with a higher risk of distress and depression, but not burnout.Conclusions: Burnout, distress, and depression are notable among anesthesiology residents. Perceived institutional support, work-life balance, strength of social support, workload, and student debt impact physician well-being.</ab>

        <ab>Aim The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the impact of daily supportive text messages over a 6-month treatment period on mood and alcohol consumption in individuals with a dual diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and depression following completion of an inpatient treatment programme. Method Ninety-five adult participants with AUD and comorbid depression were recruited into this randomized control trial, which took place after completing a 30-day rehabilitation programme. The intervention group (n = 47) received twice-daily supportive text messages over 6-months while control participants (n = 48) had treatment as usual for a 6-month period, with an added 6-month post-treatment follow-up for both groups. Drinking history in the previous 90 days as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were measured at baseline, 3- and 6-month treatment points and 6-month post treatment follow up. Results Depression scores (P = 0.02) and perceived stress scores (P &lt; 0.01) were significantly reduced at 3-month treatment point in the intervention group relative to control participants with small to medium effect. The intervention group also showed a significantly greater reduction in units per drinking day from baseline to 6-month treatment point compared to the control group with a medium effect size (P = 0.03). There were no differences in drinking or mood measures at 6-month post treatment follow-up. Conclusions Supportive text messages provide an early initial benefit in decreasing symptoms of depression and stress, with a further positive impact on alcohol consumption following a longer treatment period. Benefits did not persist six months after the intervention ended.</ab>

        <ab>The national prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders among deaf adults who use American Sign Language (ASL) remains largely understudied. Data for self-reported depression and anxiety disorder diagnosis (n = 1,704 deaf adults; n = 3,287 hearing adults) as told by their healthcare providers were drawn from HINTS-ASL and HINTS datasets. Chi-square and Poisson regression analysis compared characteristics and predictors for depression or anxiety disorder diagnosis among deaf adults. Rate of diagnosed depression or anxiety disorder was significantly higher (25%) and occurred at earlier age (45 years; SD = 15) for deaf adults compared to hearing adults (22%; mean age = 56; SD = 14). After adjusting for covariates, deaf individuals who were White, younger, female, educated, or single were significantly more likely to self-report a diagnosis of depression/anxiety disorder as told by their healthcare providers. Deaf adults have higher reported rate of diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder at an earlier onset compared to the general population. Communication access with healthcare providers is essential for accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow up care.</ab>

        <ab>An estimated 54.4 million (22.7%) U.S. adults have doctor-diagnosed arthritis (1). A report in 2012 found that, among adults aged ≥45 years with arthritis, approximately one third reported having anxiety or depression, with anxiety more common than depression (2). Studies examining mental health conditions in adults with arthritis have focused largely on depression, arthritis subtypes, and middle-aged and older adults, or have not been nationally representative (3). To address these knowledge gaps, CDC analyzed 2015-2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data* to estimate the national prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression among adults aged ≥18 years with arthritis. Among adults with arthritis, age-standardized prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depression were 22.5% and 12.1%, respectively, compared with 10.7% and 4.7% among adults without arthritis. Successful treatment approaches to address anxiety and depression among adults with arthritis are multifaceted and include screenings, referrals to mental health professionals, and evidence-based strategies such as regular physical activity and participation in self-management education to improve mental health.</ab>

        <ab>Previous studies have shown that unhealthy dietary patterns are among the most important modifiable risk factors in the development of mental health disorders. We examined the association of dietary phytochemical index (DPI) with symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress in Iranian women. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 488 women aged 20–50 years old attending health centres in the south of Tehran in 2018 were included. A validated and reliable FFQ was used for dietary assessment. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress were assessed using a validated depression, anxiety, stress scales questionnaires with twenty-one-items. DPI was estimated using the following formula: (daily energy derived from phytochemical-rich foods (kJ)/total daily energy intake (kJ))×100. The mean age of the study participants was 31·9 (sd 7·7) years. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and psychological distress among study participants was 34·6, 40·6 and 42·4 %, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, women in the highest tertile of DPI had a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (OR 0·22; 95 % CI 0·12, 0·38) and anxiety (OR 0·33; 95 % CI 0·20, 0·55), as well as psychological distress (OR 0·30; 95 % CI 0·18, 0·49) compared with those in the lowest tertile. In conclusion, we found a significant association between DPI and mental health in women. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.</ab>

        <ab>With unprecedented numbers of displaced persons worldwide, mental health clinicians in high-income countries will increasingly encounter refugee and asylum-seeking patients, many of whom have experienced significant adversity before and after their migration. This paper presents a summary of the recent evidence on the assessment and treatment of refugees across the lifespan to inform clinicians' approaches to care of refugee patients in mental health care settings. Assessment and interventions for refugees are grounded in an ecosystemic approach which considers not only pre-migratory trauma, but social, familial, and cultural determinants of mental health in the host country. Evidence for psychotherapy and pharmacological treatments are reviewed, highlighting promising interventions while acknowledging that further research is needed. Ultimately, serving refugees necessitates a biopsychosocial approach that engages clinicians as medical experts, therapists, and advocates.</ab>
        <ab>Avec des nombres sans précédent de personnes déplacées dans le monde entier, les cliniciens de la santé mentale des pays à revenu élevé rencontreront de plus en plus des patients réfugiés et demandeurs d'asile, dont beaucoup ont connu une adversité significative avant et après leur migration. Cet article présente un résumé des données probantes récentes sur l'évaluation et le traitement des réfugiés de durée de vie afin d'éclairer l'approche des soins des cliniciens aux patients réfugiés dans des contextes de soins de santé mentale. L'évaluation et les interventions pour les réfugiés sont ancrées dans une approche écosystémique qui tient compte non seulement du traumatisme pré-migratoire, mais aussi des déterminants sociaux, familiaux et culturels de la santé mentale au pays d'accueil. Les données probantes des traitements de psychothérapie et de pharmacologie sont examinées, démontrant qu'il y a des interventions prometteuses mais qu'il faut plus de recherche. Finalement, servir les réfugiés nécessite une approche biopsychosociale qui demande aux cliniciens d'être à la fois experts médicaux, thérapeutes et défenseurs des droits.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Mental health courts and assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) are tools to help people with serious mental illness engage in treatment and avoid or reduce institutionalization. As both programs become increasingly prevalent, questions remain about whether people with severe mental illness who receive AOT have the same characteristics, histories, and service needs as those who participate in mental health courts. If there are differences, each program may require assessments and interventions tailored to the specific characteristics and needs of participants.Methods: This study examined administrative criminal justice and mental health services data for 261 people with serious mental illness who participated in AOT, a mental health court, or both over seven years.Results: Three percent of the sample participated in both programs. Compared with participants in mental health court, participants in AOT were older, less likely to have an alcohol use disorder, and more likely to have a schizophrenia spectrum disorder than a bipolar disorder. The participants' histories of crisis mental health service utilization, hospitalization, and incarceration prior to program entry varied significantly by program.Conclusions: The findings suggest that there are differences among individuals with serious mental illness who are served by AOT and mental health court programs. AOT participants had greater engagement with mental health services, and a significant portion of AOT participants also had a prior criminal history that placed them at risk of future justice involvement. Program administrators need to recognize and address the clinical and criminogenic needs that place individuals at risk of becoming hospitalized and incarcerated.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The highest incidence and prevalence of mental health problems across the lifespan as well as the first onset of most long-term mental health conditions are reported for youths between 14 and 25 years of age. At the same time, only 25% of adolescents with mental health problems receive professional treatment. One explanation for poor treatment access in youths is their low help-seeking behavior. Barriers that can keep children and adolescents (C&amp;A) from seeking professional help include a lack of perceived need, structural barriers, or stigma. Interventions based on e-technology might present an effective approach, overcoming these barriers by reducing stigma and providing low-threshold access with enhanced reach, ultimately facilitating help-seeking for mental health problems among youths.Methods: The study is designed as a multi-center, randomized controlled trial. In total, an estimated number of n = 1,500 C&amp;A with mental health problems, drawn from a school-based sample of n = 15,000 pupils attending school grades 6 to 13 (≥ 12 years of age), recruited in five regions of Germany, will be randomized either to an intervention (ProHEAD online) or a control condition. C&amp;A in the intervention group will receive online access to tailored information and individual advice on where to seek professional help for their specific needs close to their place of living, case reports of and interaction with peers, as well as the opportunity for online and telephone counseling. C&amp;A in the control intervention will receive a recommendation to seek help and online information on where to find professional help. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires concerning their help-seeking behavior at baseline, during the intervention (monitoring), and also at a 1 and 2 year follow-up. The primary endpoint is the number of C&amp;A seeking conventional face-to-face professional help in the real-world setting within 1 year after their initial screening.Discussion: The trial will investigate if an Internet-based intervention can increase professional help-seeking in C&amp;A with mental health problems. With its randomized controlled design and large-scale school-based sampling, the study aims to overcome the shortages of previous research. The intervention has the potential to narrow the treatment gap in C&amp;A and to ultimately improve the mental health care system.Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00014685 .

        <ab>Background: The transition to later-life caregiving roles, especially for couples caring for each other, can be rife with ambiguity. The incident discordance in spousal perceptions of one another's role and its relationship to mental health outcomes have not been well-described.Objectives: (1) To describe the range of daily agreement between older adult spouses' perceptions of care given and care received; (2) to explore associations between caregiving agreement and daily caregiver depression, anxiety, and marital satisfaction; and (3) to evaluate differential effects for male and female caregivers.Design: Cross-sectional, ecological assessment (daily diary).Participants: Sample of 191 couples aged 60-64 (total 5196 daily surveys) drawn from the longitudinal Life and Family Legacies study.Main Measures: During 2011-2012, spouses independently completed 14 consecutive daily surveys about their mood, marital interactions, and support exchanges. Caregiving agreement was defined as the daily ratio of spouse-reported care received to self-reported care given. Using generalized linear mixed effect modeling, we examined associations between spousal care agreement and outcomes of depression, anxiety, and marital satisfaction.Key Results: Sample data demonstrated broad variability in spousal agreement, with couples exhibiting substantial disagreement on nearly one-third of couple days (780/2598 days). On days where care was exchanged, higher caregiving agreement was associated with lower caregiver depression (p &lt; 0.01) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.01) in male caregivers, and higher marital satisfaction (p = 0.03) in female caregivers. When care recipients reported receiving more support than their spouse reported giving, these associations did not persist.Conclusions: Findings suggest that spousal agreement about the amount of care given and received varies broadly and is an important consideration for primary care providers who counsel these patients day-to-day. Furthermore, agreement appears to predict mental health and relationship outcomes and should be further evaluated in this growing population of mid-to-late life adults emerging into caregiving.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Primary care-mental health integration (PC-MHI) aims to increase access to general mental health specialty (MHS) care for primary care patients thereby decreasing referrals to non-primary care-based MHS services. It remains unclear whether new patterns of usage of MHS services reflect good mental health care. This study examined the relationship between primary care clinic engagement in PC-MHI and use of different MHS services.Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 66,638 primary care patients with mental illnesses in 29 Southern California Veterans Affairs clinics (2008-2013). Regression models used clinic PC-MHI engagement (proportion of all primary care clinic patients who received PC-MHI services) to predict relative rates of general MHS visits and more specialized MHS visits (for example, visits for serious mental illness services), after adjustment for year and clinic fixed effects, other clinic interventions, and patient characteristics.Results: Patients were commonly diagnosed as having depression (35%), anxiety (36%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (22%). For every 1 percentage point increase in a clinic's PC-MHI engagement rate, patients at the clinic had 1.2% fewer general MHS visits per year (p&lt;.001) but no difference in more specialized MHS visits. The reduction in MHS visits occurred among patients with depression (-1.1%, p=.01) but not among patients with psychosis; however, the difference between the subsets was not statistically significant.Conclusions: Primary care clinics with greater engagement in PC-MHI showed reduced general MHS use rates, particularly for patients with depression, without accompanying reductions in use of more specialized MHS services.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To describe the paediatric transgender population accessing health care through the Manitoba Gender Dysphoria Assessment and Action for Youth (GDAAY) program, and report youth's experiences accessing health care in Manitoba. Methods: Demographic, medical, surgical and mental health information was extracted from the medical records of youth referred to the GDAAY program (n=174). A 77-item online survey was conducted with a subset of those youth (n=25) to identify common health care experiences and perceptions of trans youth in Manitoba. Results: Chart review of 122 natal females and 52 natal males, ranging in age from 4.7 to 17.8 years (mean 13.9 years), found 66 patients (46.8%) with a pre-existing or current mental health diagnosis, of which anxiety and depression were the most common (n=43, 30.5%). Qualitative self-reports revealed all patients had negative interactions with health care providers at some point, many having experienced lack of engagement with the medical system due to reported lack of knowledge by the provider on trans-related health services. Conclusion: Transgender youth in Manitoba seeking GDAAY services have high rates of anxiety and depression. These youth face adversity in health care settings and are distressed over long wait times for mental health services. Recommendations to improve care include increasing general health care providers' education on gender affirmative care, providing gender sensitivity training for health care providers, gathering preferred names and pronouns during triage, increasing visibility of support for LGBT+ persons in clinics, increasing resource allocation to this field and creating policies so all health care settings are safe places for trans youth.</ab>

        <ab>This narrative review highlights key issues in men's mental health and identifies approaches to research, policy and practice that respond to men's styles of coping. Issues discussed are: 1) the high incidence of male suicide (80% of suicide deaths in Canada, with a peak in the mid-50 s age group) accompanied by low public awareness; 2) the perplexing nature of male depression, manifesting in forms that are poorly recognised by current diagnostic approaches and thus poorly treated; 3) the risky use of alcohol among men, again common and taking a huge toll on mental and physical health; 4) the characteristic ways in which men manage psychological suffering, the coping strengths to be recognised, and the gaps to be addressed; 5) the underutilization of mental health services by men, and the implication for clinical outcomes; and 6) male-specific approaches to service provision designed to improve men's accessing of care, with an emphasis on Canadian programs. The main conclusion is that a high proportion of men in Western society have acquired psychological coping strategies that are often dysfunctional. There is a need for men to learn more adaptive coping approaches long before they reach a crisis point. Recommendations are made to address men's mental health through: healthcare policy that facilitates access; research on tailoring interventions to men; population-level initiatives to improve the capacity of men to cope with psychological distress; and clinical practice that is sensitive to the expression of mental health problems in men and that responds in a relevant manner.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Primary care practices are changing the way that they provide care by increasing their medical home functionality. Medical home functionality can improve access to care and increase patient-centeredness, which is essential for persons with mental health issues. This study aims to explore the degree to which medical home functions have been implemented by primary care practices that care for adults with psychological distress.Methods: Analysis of the 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component and Medical Organizations Survey. This unique data set links data from a nationally representative sample of US households to the practices in which they receive primary care. This study focused on adults aged 18 and above.Results: As compared to adults without psychological distress, adults with psychological distress had significantly higher rates of chronic illness and poverty. Adults with psychological distress were more likely to receive care from practices that include advanced practitioners and are non-profit or hospital-based. Multivariate models that were adjusted for patient-level and practice-level characteristics indicated that adults with psychological distress are as likely to receive primary care from practices with medical home functionality, including case management, electronic health records, flexible scheduling, and PCMH certification, as adults without psychological distress.Conclusions: Practices that care for adults with mental health issues have not been left behind in the transition towards medical home models of primary care. Policy makers should continue to prioritize adults with mental health issues to receive primary care through this model of delivery due to this population's great potential to benefit from improved access and care coordination.Trial Registration: This study does not report the results of a health care intervention on human subject's participants.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Food insecurity and mental health negatively affect the lives of women in the United States. Participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) provided the opportunity to understand the association of food insecurity with depression and mental well-being over time.Objective: We investigated the association between current and persistent food insecurity and depression among women at risk of or living with HIV in the United States.Methods: We used longitudinal data from the WIHS, a prospective cohort study in women at risk of or living with HIV from multiple sites in the United States. Participants completed 6 semiannual assessments from 2013 to 2016 on food security (FS; high, marginal, low, and very low) and mental health (i.e., depressive symptoms and mental well-being). We used multiple regression analysis to estimate the association between these variables.Results: Among 2551 participants, 44% were food insecure and 35% reported depressive symptoms indicative of probable depression. Current marginal, low, and very low FS were associated with 2.1-, 3.5-, and 5.5-point (all P &lt; 0.001) higher depression scores, respectively. In models adjusting for both current and previous FS, previous marginal, low, and very low FS were associated with 0.2-, 0.93-, and 1.52-point higher scores, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). Women with very low FS at both time points (persistent food insecurity) had a 6.86-point higher depression score (P &lt; 0.001). In the mental health models, there was a dose-response relation between current FS and worse mental health even when controlling for previous FS (all P &lt; 0.001). Previous low FS was associated with worse mental health. These associations did not differ by HIV status.Conclusions: Food insecurity placed women at risk of depression and poor mental well-being, but the risk was substantially higher for women experiencing persistent food insecurity. Future interventions to improve women's mental health call for multilevel components that include addressing food insecurity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is limited and conflicting evidence for associations between use of screen-based technology and anxiety and depression in young people. We examined associations between screen time measured at 16 years and anxiety and depression at 18.Methods: Participants (n = 14,665; complete cases n = 1869) were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK-based prospective cohort study. We assessed associations between various types of screen time (watching television, using a computer, and texting, all measured via questionnaire at 16y), both on weekdays and at weekends, and anxiety and depression (measured via the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule at 18y). Using ordinal logistic regression, we adjusted for multiple confounders, particularly focussing on activities that might have been replaced by screen time (for example exercising or playing outdoors).Results: More time spent using a computer on weekdays was associated with a small increased risk of anxiety (OR for 1-2 h = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.35; OR for 3+ hours = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.55, both compared to &lt; 1 h, p for linear trend = 0.003). We found a similar association between computer use at weekends and anxiety (OR for 1-2 h = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.46; OR for 3+ hours = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.48, p for linear trend = 0.03). Greater time spent using a computer on weekend days only was associated with a small increased risk in depression (OR for 1-2 h = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.35; OR for 3+ hours = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.65, p for linear trend = 0.003). Adjusting for time spent alone attenuated effects for anxiety but not depression. There was little evidence for associations with texting or watching television.Conclusions: We found associations between increased screen time, particularly computer use, and a small increased risk of anxiety and depression. Time spent alone was found to attenuate some associations, and further research should explore this.</ab>

        <ab>Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are currently underserved or who lack access to services, but barriers to its widespread utilization remain. Use of different electronic health record systems (EHRs) by various health care systems is one such barrier. Utilization of different EHRs makes it difficult for providers to review patient data and to document clinical encounters. This column describes a Web portal developed by the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program that connects participating hospital emergency departments and remote psychiatric providers, allowing them to share secure electronic health information regarding patient encounters across different EHRs.</ab>

        <ab>This study compared health status across four trauma/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) groups of older adults with depression, anxiety, and/or at-risk drinking who attended primary care appointments (N = 1,199; mean age = 73.5 yr), mostly at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. The trauma and PTSD categories were PTSD (n = 81), partial PTSD (n = 127), trauma only (n = 323), and no trauma (n = 668). Physical and mental health-related quality of life (HQL), indices of social and economic impairment and stigma regarding treatment-seeking were compared among groups. Group differences were found for several indicators of functional impairment; the PTSD group had fewer close friends and higher treatment-seeking stigma beliefs related to having a disorder. Linear mixed modeling examined associations between trauma/PTSD group and HQL. After accounting for covariates, the trauma/PTSD groups differed across the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 scales and component scores (indicated by significant group by scale interaction). Differences among groups were confined to mental health measures; those with PTSD had worse HQL. Post hoc analyses examined the number of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses by trauma/PTSD group. Overall, findings indicate that mental HQL varies among older adults with trauma and PTSD and that although treatment-related stigma does not differ among groups, it does affect HQL.</ab>

        <ab>An editorial is presented which explores the difference between the treatment of depression with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The author reflects on a study that focused on whether choice of modality worked to enhance response to PTSD treatment or at least adherence to and completion of treatment. The lack of specificity in the psychological treatments of response to depression to treatment among nonpsychotic patients as opposed to PTSD is also tackled.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The long-term effects of military deployment on the mental health of war veterans have been investigated extensively, but few studies have examined the long-term impact of parental deployment on children's mental health.Methods: Using a retrospective, multigenerational survey and propensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects and endogeneity bias, we investigated the impact of parental deployment on the mental health of the adult children of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. We analysed data from 1966 adult men (35%) and women (65%) whose fathers (N = 1418) were selected at random from the population of surviving men who served in the Australian army during the Vietnam War (1962-75). Mean age of respondents was 37. The main outcome measures were self-reported diagnosis or treatment for anxiety and depression (i.e. lifetime and previous 12 months), suicidality based on Psychiatric Symptom Frequency Scale, and current mental health as measured by the Mental Health Inventory of the SF-36. The key independent variable was whether their fathers were deployed to the Vietnam War.Results: Almost 40 years after the war, the adult children of deployed veterans were more likely to have been diagnosed with anxiety [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 2.28] and depression (OR = 1.77, CI = 1.03, 3.05), to have had thoughts of suicide and self-harm (OR = 2.39, CI = 1.57, 3.65) and to have made suicidal plans (OR = 3.52, CI = 1.40, 8.85) than the offspring of comparable, non-deployed army veterans. They also reported poorer current mental health (Coefficient = -5.08, CI = -6.60 - -3.56).Conclusions: The results imply that there are significant and enduring adverse effects of parental deployment on the mental health of children in military families, and provide some insight into the potential long-term impacts of recent military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq.</ab>

        <ab>The Department of Veterans Affairs traumatic brain injury (TBI) screening program is intended to detect and expedite treatment for TBI and postconcussive symptoms. Between April 14, 2007, and May 31, 2012, of 66,089 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans who screened positive on first-level TBI screening and later completed comprehensive TBI evaluation that includes the Neurobehavioral Symptoms Inventory, 72% reported moderate to very severe cognitive impairment (problems with attention, concentration, memory, etc.) that interfered with daily activities. This included 42% who were found not to have sustained combat-related mild TBI (mTBI). In contrast, 70.0% received a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis and 45.8% received a depression diagnosis. Compared with Veterans without mTBI, PTSD, or depression diagnoses, the lowest risk for self-reported cognitive impairment was in Veterans with confirmed mTBI only; a greater risk was found in those with PTSD diagnoses, with the greatest risk in Veterans with PTSD, depression, and confirmed mTBI, suggesting only a weakly additive effect of mTBI. These findings suggest that Veterans with multiple mental health comorbidities, not just those with TBI, report moderate to very severe cognitive impairment. Mental health treatment for conditions such as PTSD and depression (with or without TBI) may result in improvements in cognitive functioning and/or include assessment and support for Veterans experiencing cognitive problems.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The main objective of this study was to report the feasibility of delivering online cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) treatments for anxiety and depression in a national public mental health service.Methods: A prospective noncontrolled cohort study was conducted of all patients who began assessment or treatment at the MindSpot Clinic from January through December 2013. Clinic services were used by a representative cross-section of the Australian population. Mean age at assessment was 36.4±13.0 years, and age range was 18-86 years. Patients completed one of four online courses over eight weeks, during which they received weekly support from a therapist via telephone or secure e-mail. Primary outcome measures were the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) administered at posttreatment and three months posttreatment.Results: A total of 10,293 adults who self-identified as having problems with anxiety or depression commenced assessment, and 7,172 completed the assessment and were eligible for analysis. Of these, 2,049 enrolled in a course and 1,471 completed the course, for a course completion rate of 71.8%. Moderate to large noncontrolled effect sizes (Cohen's d=.67-1.66, 95% confidence interval=.08-2.07) were found from assessment to three-month follow-up. At posttreatment and follow-up, reliable recovery ranged from 46.7% to 51.1%, and deterioration ranged from 1.9% to 3.8%. Mean total therapist time per patient was 111.8±61.6 minutes.Conclusions: The MindSpot Clinic produced treatment outcomes that were comparable to results from published clinical trials of iCBT. This model of service delivery represents an innovative method of providing accessible, low-cost, effective, and acceptable mental health services to many people who currently are not receiving care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Medical school presents a time of psychological distress for many students, who are less likely than the general population to seek mental health treatment due to multiple treatment barriers. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs may be an acceptable option for medical students. This study aims to assess acceptability and usability of ThinkFeelDo, an iCBT program, and to examine the impact of the program on perceived stress, quality of life, and the development of cognitive and behavioral coping skills.Method: Fourteen medical students (M age = 25.4 years, 50% female) participated in the 6-week ThinkFeelDo program and completed baseline and end of treatment assessments.Results: ThinkFeelDo was used (login M = 11.9, SD = 9.8) and was rated as somewhat useful. Participants requested further refinement of lessons to better fit the typical narrative of a medical student and endorsed interest in the program being offered at the beginning of medical school. At end of program, participants increased the frequency with which they used cognitive and behavioral coping skills, t(10) = -3.400, p = .007.Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that medical students are willing to utilize online mental health programs and may receive benefit. However, the sample was small, self-selected, and without a comparison group. Feedback collected through this study provides insight on how to effectively integrate iCBT programs into the medical school experience.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Asylum-seeking children and adolescents (ASCs) who have resettled in Western countries show elevated rates of psychological distress, including Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety. Most longitudinal data suggest a relatively stable course of symptoms during the first years in exile. However, no longitudinal examination of the mental health of ASCs, who resettled in Europe in the wake of the 2015-17 European migrant crisis, has been conducted so far.Methods: A prospective cohort study looked at 98 ASCs who resettled in southern Germany throughout 2015-17. They mainly came from Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea, and Iraq. Baseline assessments were undertaken 22 months, on average, after resettlement, and follow-up assessments 1 year thereafter. Seventy-two ASCs could be secured for the follow-up. The measures included self-report questionnaires screening for PTSS, depression, anxiety, externalizing behavior, and post-migration factors that were administered in an interview-like setting. Results were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression analysis.Results: Participating ASCs reported on average eight potentially traumatic experiences and high levels of psychological distress at baseline that had significantly declined at follow-up. At follow-up, rates of clinically significant symptoms ranged from 9.7% (externalizing behavior) to 37.5% (PTSS). There was considerable individual variation in symptom change resulting in multiple mental health trajectories. ASCs whose asylum applications had been rejected presented significantly more symptoms than ASCs whose asylum applications had been accepted between assessments. Baseline psychopathology and asylum status predicted follow-up symptom severity.Conclusions: In contrast to earlier studies, the symptom severity in this sample of ASCs in Germany ameliorated between assessments. Decisions on the asylum applications of ASCs are thought to contribute to the course of symptoms. Since levels of psychological distress were still high, dissemination and implementation of appropriate treatments for ASCs is crucial.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health outcomes of a state-supported implementation in community mental health settings of an evidence-based lifestyle intervention for overweight and obese adults with serious mental illness.Methods: Weight and fitness outcomes were evaluated for 122 overweight or obese adults with serious mental illness in four community mental health centers (CMHCs) that were participating in a phased statewide implementation of the In SHAPE lifestyle intervention. Six- and 12-month outcomes were compared between two CMHCs that implemented In SHAPE in the first 12 months and two CMHCs with similar characteristics that implemented In SHAPE in a subsequent phase in the statewide implementation 12 months later.Results: Participants in the two In SHAPE sites (N=63 participants) lost significantly more weight (p=.003) and showed greater improvement in fitness (p=.011) compared with participants at the two usual care control sites (N=59 participants). At six months, nearly half (49%) of In SHAPE participants and at 12 months more than half (60%) of In SHAPE participants showed clinically significant cardiovascular risk reduction defined as ≥5% weight loss or improved fitness (&gt;50 m [164 feet] increase on the six-minute walk test). The difference between the In SHAPE and control groups was not statistically significant.Conclusions: This natural experiment demonstrated promising public health benefits of a practical implementation of health promotion programming for overweight and obese adults with serious mental illness and offers a potential model for reducing risk of early mortality among individuals served by state-funded mental health centers nationwide.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Executive functioning deficits have been documented among congenital heart disease (CHD) survivors and may contribute to emotional distress. Little research has investigated the role of coping in this association. This study examined the role of coping in accounting for the association between self-reported executive function problems and internalizing symptoms among adolescents and emerging adults (AEAs), as well as young adults (YAs) with CHD.Methods: Participants included 74 AEA (Mage = 19.32 ± 3.47 years, range 15-25 years) and 98 YA CHD survivors (Mage = 32.00 ± 3.69 years, range 26-39 years), recruited from pediatric and adult outpatient cardiology clinics. Participants completed self-report measures of executive function problems, coping (primary control, secondary control, and disengagement coping), and internalizing symptoms. Lesion severity classification and functional impairment due to symptoms of heart failure were determined from medical chart review.Results: Significant problems in executive function were reported by 5% of AEA and 13% of YA. Coping was not associated with executive function problems or internalizing symptoms for AEA. However, among YA, less use of adaptive coping strategies and more maladaptive coping responses was associated with both more executive function problems and internalizing symptoms. An indirect effect of executive function problems on internalizing symptoms via secondary control coping emerged for YA.Conclusions: Executive function problems may disrupt the ability to use important adaptive coping skills, such as cognitive reappraisal, positive thinking, and acceptance, thereby resulting in greater emotional distress among YA CHD survivors.</ab>

        <ab>Aim To examine dual trajectories of anxiety/depression symptoms and alcohol use among drug-using youth seeking care from an urban emergency department (ED), their baseline correlates and co-occurring trajectories of severe violence. Short summary There were five characteristic dual trajectories of alcohol use and depression/anxiety symptoms. Community violence exposure was highest among individuals with high-depression/anxiety symptom trajectories. Individuals with concurrently high-alcohol use and depression/anxiety symptom trajectories reported that the most delinquent peer affiliations, and had the highest rates of severe violence over time. Methods We analyzed data from 599 drug-using (primarily marijuana) youth ages 14–24 (349 assault-injured) recruited from December 2009 to September 2011 into a 24-month longitudinal study at a Level-1 ED in Flint, Michigan. Youth self-reported substance use, depression and anxiety symptoms, peer/parental behaviors, and severe violence involvement at baseline and four biannual follow-up assessments. Bivariate latent trajectory models identified homogeneous groups with similar trajectories on alcohol use and anxiety/depression symptoms; we compared baseline characteristics of each trajectory group and concurrent trajectories of severe violence (victimization and aggression). Results Our model identified five trajectory groups: Low drinking/No symptoms (LN; 10.4%; n = 62), No drinking/Moderate symptoms (NM; 15.7%; n = 94), Low drinking/Moderate symptoms (LM; 30.2%; n = 181), Low drinking/High symptoms (LH; 16.4%; n = 98) and High drinking/High symptoms (HH; 27.5%; n = 164). The HH group was characterized by more delinquent peer associations, and rates of community violence were higher among the high symptom groups. The HH group had the highest severe violence perpetration and victimization rates across time points; the LH group had similar violence rates to the LM and NM groups and the LN group had the lowest violence rates across time. Conclusions Among drug-using youth, alcohol use interventions could benefit from a focus on peer influences, and those with a joint focus on violence involvement may be improved via inclusion of content related to mental health and community violence exposure.</ab>

        <ab>The Sixth Kraepelin Symposium was held at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, LMU Munich in October 2018, covering reports from 12 working groups (Keith H. Nuechterlein, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles; Kim T. Mueser, Ph.D. Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Boston University, U.S.A.; Dominic Dwyer, Ph.D, Hospital LMU, Munich; David Fowler, Ph.D. University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K.; Martin Hautzinger, Ph.D. University of Tübingen; Nikolaos Koutsouleris, M.D. Hospital LMU, Munich; Stephan Leucht, M.D. Technical University Munich, Munich; David Miklowitz, Ph.D. UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles. U.S.A.; Cornelius Schüle, M.D. Hospital LMU, Munich; Florian Seemüller. M.D. kbo-Lech-Mangfall Clinics for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Garmisch Partenkirchen; Carla Torrent, Ph.D. Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.) from the United States and Europe on understanding and treating cognitive impairment and depression in schizophrenia and affective disorders. Current psychological interventions to improve outcome in schizophrenia and affective disorder such as cognitive remediation, illness management, psychoeducational and cognitive therapy were focused on, as were evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatment options, guidelines for treating cognitive deficits and depression in schizophrenia, Cochrane-meta-analysis of acute therapies, relapse prevention as well as supported withdrawal from medication. Prevention of cognitive dysfunction and symptom exacerbation was approached in terms of machine learning methods to revisit Kraepelin's illness distinctions, application of new strategies in order to increase the rate of social recovery in patients with first-episode psychosis as well as in terms of state of the art psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder in adolescents. Finally, the dissemination of information to consumers and the contribution to the reduction of stereotypes in psychiatry was also part of the symposiums aims.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: While depression and anxiety are common mental health issues, only a small segment of the population has access to standard one-on-one treatment. The use of smartphone apps can fill this gap. An app recommender system may help improve user engagement of these apps and eventually symptoms.Methods: IntelliCare was a suite of apps for depression and anxiety, with a Hub app that provided app recommendations aiming to increase user engagement. This study captured the records of 8057 users of 12 apps. We measured overall engagement and app-specific usage longitudinally by the number of weekly app sessions ("loyalty") and the number of days with app usage ("regularity") over 16 weeks. Hub and non-Hub users were compared using zero-inflated Poisson regression for loyalty, linear regression for regularity, and Cox regression for engagement duration. Adjusted analyses were performed in 4561 users for whom we had baseline characteristics. Impact of Hub recommendations was assessed using the same approach.Results: When compared to non-Hub users in adjusted analyses, Hub users had a lower risk of discontinuing IntelliCare (hazard ratio = 0.67, 95% CI, 0.62-0.71), higher loyalty (2- to 5-fold), and higher regularity (0.1-0.4 day/week greater). Among Hub users, Hub recommendations increased app-specific loyalty and regularity in all 12 apps.Discussion/conclusion: Centralized app recommendations increase overall user engagement of the apps, as well as app-specific usage. Further studies relating app usage to symptoms can validate that such a recommender improves clinical benefits and does so at scale.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is prevalent and costly, but despite effective treatments, is often untreated. Recent efforts to improve depression care have focused on primary care settings. Disparities in treatment initiation for depression have been reported, with fewer minority and older individuals starting treatment.Objective: To describe patient characteristics associated with depression treatment initiation and treatment choice (antidepressant medications or psychotherapy) among patients newly diagnosed with depression in primary care settings.Design: A retrospective observational design was used to analyze electronic health record data.Patients: A total of 241,251 adults newly diagnosed with depression in primary care settings among five health care systems from 2010 to 2013.Main Measures: ICD-9 codes for depression, following a 365-day period with no depression diagnosis or treatment, were used to identify new depression episodes. Treatment initiation was defined as a completed psychotherapy visit or a filled prescription for antidepressant medication within 90 days of diagnosis. Depression severity was measured with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores on the day of diagnosis.Key Results: Overall, 35.7% of patients with newly diagnosed depression initiated treatment. The odds of treatment initiation among Asians, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics were at least 30% lower than among non-Hispanic whites, controlling for all other variables. The odds of patients aged  ≥ 60 years starting treatment were half those of patients age 44 years and under. Treatment initiation increased with depression severity, but was only 53% among patients with a PHQ-9 score of ≥ 10. Among minority patients, psychotherapy was initiated significantly more often than medication.Conclusions: Screening for depression in primary care is a positive step towards improving detection, treatment, and outcomes for depression. However, study results indicate that treatment initiation remains suboptimal, and disparities persist. A better understanding of patient factors, and particularly system-level factors, that influence treatment initiation is needed to inform efforts by heath care systems to improve depression treatment engagement and to reduce disparities.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Doctors who work at cancer hospitals are at high risk of developing emotional distress. This study evaluated the prevalence of burnout, anxiety, and depression in a sample of oncologists of various specialties and sought to identify how much of this distress is explained by specific pre-established characteristics.Methods: This cross-sectional study used online surveys. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The variables associated with p-values &lt; 0.10 in the univariate analyses were included in blocks of hierarchical binary logistic regression models to identify the predictors of burnout, depression, and anxiety.Results: Of the 227 physicians (response rate = 70.5%), 132 (58.1%) were identified as having burnout (high emotional exhaustion [EE] and depersonalization [DP]); furthermore, 28 (12.3%) had depression (HADS-D ≥ 11), and 44 (19.4%) had anxiety (HADS-A ≥ 11). The block of perceptions related to the workplace explained 22.4%, 7.7%, and 10.6% of the variances of burnout, depression, and anxiety, respectively. On the other hand, the outside-of-work characteristics block explained only 3.1%, 13.4%, and 3.4% of the variances of burnout, depression, and anxiety, respectively.Conclusions: Work-related stressors are associated with burnout, but few are associated with anxiety and depression. Outside-of-work characteristics explained little of the distress reported by physicians. Strategies focused on perceptions of professional recognition and lower workloads that stimulate positive relationships between doctors and other health professionals are desirable in oncological context.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of MRI region-of-interest and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because patients have high rates of comorbid depression, an additional objective was to compare the findings to a meta-analysis of MRI studies in depression.Method: The MEDLINE database was searched for studies from 1985 through 2016. A total of 113 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in an online database. Of these, 66 were selected for the region-of-interest meta-analysis and 13 for the VBM meta-analysis. The region-of-interest meta-analysis was conducted and compared with a meta-analysis of major depressive disorder. Within the region-of-interest meta-analysis, three subanalyses were conducted that included control groups with and without trauma.Results: In the region-of-interest meta-analysis, patients with PTSD compared with all control subjects were found to have reduced brain volume, intracranial volume, and volumes of the hippocampus, insula, and anterior cingulate. PTSD patients compared with nontraumatized or traumatized control subjects showed similar changes. Traumatized compared with nontraumatized control subjects showed smaller volumes of the hippocampus bilaterally. For all regions, pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) varied from -0.84 to 0.43, and number of studies from three to 41. The VBM meta-analysis revealed prominent volumetric reductions in the medial prefrontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate. Compared with region-of-interest data from patients with major depressive disorder, those with PTSD had reduced total brain volume, and both disorders were associated with reduced hippocampal volume.Conclusions: The meta-analyses revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and trauma and suggest that global brain volume reductions distinguish PTSD from major depression.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the primary bariatric surgery procedure in the U.S. Over 50% of people presenting for surgery have psychiatric diagnoses. The study purpose was to evaluate change in anxiety and depression symptoms and medication use after SG. Methods. Subjects completing SG with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression treated with medication were retrospectively identified from the electronic medical record (EMR) of Synergy Bariatrics, a department of the Erie County Medical Center. Phone outreach was made to complete seven-point global impression of change scale classifying symptom improvement or worsening in the 3- to 6-month postoperative period. Improvement or worsening was defined as either all reported symptoms improving or worsening or ≥1 improving or worsening while remaining unchanged. If ≥1 symptom improved and worsened, it was classified as mixed. No change required the same profile before and after surgery. Medication, dose, and changes were identified by EMR, verified during interview and classified as no change, discontinued, decreased, or increased. Results. 59 subjects completed the interview. 21 subjects were diagnosed with anxiety. 13 (62%) had no change in therapy and 5 (24%) decreased. Symptoms improved in 12 (57%), worsened in 3 (14%), and mixed in 5 (24%). When symptoms improved, the same dose was present in 7/12 (58%) and dose decreased in 3 (25%). 51 subjects were diagnosed with depression. 32 (63%) had no change in therapy, 11 (21%) discontinued, and 4 (8%) decreased. Symptoms improved in 34 (67%), mixed in 10 (20%), worsened in 4 (8%), and unchanged in 3 (6%). When symptoms improved, the same regimen and dose was present in 21/34 cases (62%) and discontinued in 9 (26%). Conclusion. Anxiety symptoms improved in &gt;50% of subjects at predominantly the same or reduced dosage. Depression symptoms improved in 67% and commonly without therapy change. These data suggest evidence that patients undergoing SG while on medication for anxiety or depression may have early symptom improvement on the same or lessened dosage.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examines health and service use outcomes and associated factors among homeless adults participating in a brief interdisciplinary intervention following discharge from hospital.Method: Using a pre-post cohort design, 223 homeless adults with mental health needs were enrolled in the Coordinated Access to Care for the Homeless (CATCH) program, a 4- to 6-month interdisciplinary intervention offering case management, peer support, access to primary psychiatric care, and supplementary community services. Study participants were interviewed at program entry and at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits and assessed for health status, acute care service use, housing outcomes, mental health, substance use, quality of life, and their working alliance with service providers. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations were performed to examine outcomes longitudinally. Additional post hoc analyses evaluated differences between CATCH participants and a comparison group of homeless adults experiencing mental illness who received usual services over the same period.Results: In the pre-post analyses, CATCH participants had statistically significant improvements in mental and physical health status and reductions in mental health symptoms, substance misuse, and the number of hospital admissions. The strength of the working alliance between participants and their case manager was associated with reduced health care use and mental health symptoms. Post hoc analyses suggest that CATCH may be associated with statistically significant improvements in mental health symptoms in the study population.Conclusions: A brief interdisciplinary intervention may be a promising approach to improving health outcomes among homeless adults with unmet health needs. Further rigorous research is needed into the effectiveness of brief interventions following discharge from hospital.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Despite the growing consensus that collaborative care is effective, limited research has focused on the importance of collaborative care fidelity as it relates to mental health clinical outcomes.Objective: To assess the relationship of collaborative care fidelity on symptom trajectories and clinical outcomes among military service members enrolled in a multi-site randomized controlled trial for the treatment of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Design: Study data for our analyses came from a two-parallel arm randomized trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a centralized collaborative care model compared to the existing collaborative care model for the treatment of PTSD and depression. All patients were included in the analyses to evaluate how longitudinal trajectories of PTSD and depression scores differed across various collaborative care fidelity groupings.Participants: A total of 666 US Military Service members screening positive for probable PTSD or depression through primary care.Main Measures: Disease registry data from a web-based clinical management support tool was used to measure collaborative care fidelity for patients enrolled in the trial. Participant depression and PTSD symptoms were collected independently from research survey assessments at four time points across the 1-year trial period. Treatment utilization records were acquired from the Military Health System administrative records to determine mental health service use.Key Results: Consistent and late fidelity to the collaborative care model predicted an improving symptom trajectory over the course of treatment. This effect was more pronounced for patients with depression than for patients with PTSD.Conclusions: Long-term fidelity to key collaborative care elements throughout care episodes may improve depression outcomes, particularly for patients with elevated symptoms. More controlled research is needed to further understand the influence of collaborative care fidelity on clinical outcomes.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT01492348.</ab>

        <ab>Mental health care practices supported by electronic communication, referred to as e-mental health, offer ways to increase access to mental health resources. In recent years, e-mental health interventions using clinical video teleconferencing, Internet-based interventions, social networking sites, and telephones have emerged as viable, cost-effective methods to augment traditional service delivery. Whereas some research evaluates attitudes about e-mental health, few studies have assessed interest in using these approaches in a contemporary sample of U.S. Veterans. This study sought to understand willingness to use e-mental health in a diverse group of Veterans residing in Hawaii. Mailed surveys were completed by 600 Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans and National Guard members. Results suggest that overall willingness to use e-mental health ranged from 32.2% to 56.7% depending on modality type. Importantly, Veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were significantly less likely to report willingness to use each e-mental health modality than their peers without PTSD, despite their greater desire for mental health services. These results suggest that despite solutions to logistical barriers afforded via e-mental health services, certain barriers to mental health care may persist, especially among Veterans who screen positive for PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors sought to determine whether a multicomponent, community-based program for preventing maternal depression also promotes engagement with mental health services for individuals with persistent symptoms.Methods: Mothers of children enrolled in Head Start were randomly assigned between February 2011 and May 2016 to Problem-Solving Education (PSE) (N=111) or usual services (N=119) and assessed every two months for 12 months.Results: Among 230 participants, 66% were Hispanic; 223 participants were included in the analysis. For all PSE participants, engagement with specialty mental health services increased from approximately 10% to 21% between two and 12 months. The PSE group was more likely than the control group to be engaged in specialty services at 12 months (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07-5.20), and the rate of engagement with specialty services over time (treatment × time interaction) favored PSE (p=.016). Among PSE participants with persistent depressive symptoms over the follow-up period, engagement with specialty services increased from 12% (two months) to approximately 46% (12 months), whereas among control group participants, engagement fluctuated between 24% and 33%, without a clear trajectory pattern. At 12 months, PSE participants with persistent symptoms were more likely to engage with specialty care compared with their counterparts in the control group (AOR=6.95, CI=1.50-32.19). The treatment × time interaction was significant for the persistently symptomatic subgroup (p=.029) but not for the episodically symptomatic or the asymptomatic subgroups.Conclusions: Embedding mental health programs in Head Start is a promising strategy to engage parents with depressive symptoms in care, especially those with persistent symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Clinical depression in children as young as age 3 has been validated, and prevalence rates are similar to the school-age disorder. Homotypic continuity between early and later childhood depression has been observed, with alterations in brain function and structure similar to those reported in depressed adults. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating depression as early as developmentally possible, given the relative treatment resistance and small effect sizes for treatments later in life. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial of a dyadic parent-child psycho-therapy for early childhood depression that focuses on enhancing the child's emotional competence and emotion regulation.Method: A modified version of the empirically tested parent-child interaction therapy with a novel "emotion development" module (PCIT-ED) was compared with a waiting list condition in a randomized controlled trial in 229 parent-child dyads with children 3-6.11 years of age. Both study arms lasted 18 weeks.Results: Children in the PCIT-ED group had lower rates of depression (primary outcome), lower depression severity, and lower impairment compared with those in the waiting list condition (Cohen's d values, &gt;1.0). Measures of child emotional functioning and parenting stress and depression were significantly improved in the PCIT-ED group.Conclusions: The findings from this randomized controlled trial of a parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression suggest that earlier identification and intervention in this chronic and relapsing disorder represents a key new pathway for more effective treatment. Manualized PCIT-ED, administered by master's-level clinicians, is feasible for delivery in community health settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: An increased understanding of repetitive dysfunctional patterns and their relationship to an individual's life history is regarded as a key mechanism of change in insight-oriented therapies. At the same time, empirical research on the insight-outcome relationship is rare, and its generalizability is restricted by the use of a wide range of definitions and methods among studies. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to systematically examine the association between patient insight and psychotherapy outcome across a range of treatment modalities.Method: Insight was defined as patients' understanding of associations between past and present experiences, typical relationship patterns, and the relation between interpersonal challenges, emotional experience, and psychological symptoms. From 13,849 initially identified abstracts, the authors extracted 23 independent effect sizes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of the insight-outcome relationship. Risk of publication bias was assessed with funnel plot inspections, Egger's regression test, and Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill procedure as sensitivity analyses.Results: A significant, moderate correlation (r=0.31) was observed between insight and treatment outcome. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results.Conclusions: The findings support the importance of insight for psychotherapy outcome. Insight may be a relevant mechanism of change across different treatment modalities.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression has become one of the leading contributors to the global disease burden. Evidence-based treatments for depression are available, but access to them is still limited in some instances. As technology has become more integrated into mental health care, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols have become available and have been recently transposed to mobile environments (e.g., smartphones) in the form of "apps." Preliminary research on some depression apps has shown promising results in reducing subthreshold or mild to moderate depressive symptoms. However, this small number of studies reports a low statistical power and they have not yet been replicated. Moreover, none of them included an active placebo comparison group. This is problematic, as a "digital placebo effect" may explain some of the positive effects documented until now. The aim of this study is to test a newly developed mobile app firmly grounded in the CBT theory of depression to determine whether this app is clinically useful in decreasing moderate depressive symptoms when compared with an active placebo. Additionally, we are interested in the app's effect on emotional wellbeing and depressogenic cognitions.Methods/design: Romanian-speaking adults (18 years and older) with access to a computer and the Internet and owning a smartphone are included in the study. A randomized, three-arm clinical trial is being conducted (i.e., active intervention, placebo intervention and delayed intervention). Two hundred and twenty participants with moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., obtaining scores &gt;9 and ≤16 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be randomized to the three conditions. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting serious mental health problems, or legal or health issues that would prevent them from using the app, as well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. Participants randomized to the active and placebo interventions will use the smartphone app for 6 weeks. A short therapist check-in via phone will take place every week. Participants in the delayed-intervention condition will be given access to the app after 6 weeks from randomization. The primary outcome is the level of depressive symptomatology. The intervention delivered through the app to the active condition includes psychoeducational materials and exercises based on CBT for depression, while the placebo intervention uses a sham version of the app (i.e., similar structure of courses and exercises).Discussion: To our knowledge, this study protocol is the first to test the efficacy of a smartphone app for depressive symptomatology in the form of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that includes an active placebo condition. As such, this can substantially add to the body of evidence supporting the use of apps designed to decrease depression.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03060200 . Registered on 1 February 2017. The first participant was enrolled on 17 February 2017.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a disease-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol on anxiety and depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescents and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Method: A parallel group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 6 centers of (pediatric) gastroenterology. Included were 70 patients and young adults (10-25 years) with IBD and subclinical anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Patients were randomized into 2 groups, stratified by center: (a) standard medical care (care-as-usual [CAU]) plus disease-specific manualized CBT (Primary and Secondary Control Enhancement Training for Physical Illness; PASCET-PI), with 10 weekly sessions, 3 parent sessions, and 3 booster sessions (n = 37), or (b) CAU only (n = 33). Primary analysis concerned the reliable change in anxiety and depressive symptoms after 3 months (immediate posttreatment assessment). Exploratory analyses concerned (1) the course of anxiety and depressive symptoms and HRQOL in subgroups based on age, and (2) the influence of age, gender, and disease type on the effect of the PASCET-PI.Results: Overall, all participants improved significantly in their anxiety and depressive symptoms and HRQOL, regardless of group, age, gender, and disease type. Primary chi-square tests and exploratory linear mixed models showed no difference in outcomes between the PASCET-PI (n = 35) and the CAU group (n = 33).Conclusions: In youth with IBD and subclinical anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, preliminary results of immediate post-treatment assessment indicated that a disease-specific CBT added to standard medical care did not perform better than standard medical care in improving psychological symptoms or HRQOL.

The whole health care model embedded monitoring of overall health and wellness education within the center's outpatient mental and substance use disorder treatment services, and it improved care coordination with primary care providers.Methods: This study used fee-for-service Medicare administrative claims and enrollment data for June 2009 through July 2015 for the intervention (N=846) and matched comparison group (N=2,643) to estimate a difference-in-differences model.Results: For the first two-and-a-half years of the program, Medicare expenditures decreased by $266 per month on average for each enrolled beneficiary in the intervention group relative to the comparison group (p&lt;.01). Intervention clients had .02 fewer hospitalizations, .03 fewer emergency department (ED) visits, and .13 fewer office visits per month relative to the comparison group (p&lt;.05 for all estimates).Conclusions: Overall, the whole health model reduced Medicare expenditures, ED visits, and hospitalization rates. These results may be due in part to the availability of more comprehensive medical data and staff's improved awareness of client's overall health needs. There was a lag between initial program implementation and the program's substantial impact on health expenditures. This lag may be attributed to the substantial transformation and time needed for staff to adapt to the program.</ab>

        <ab>For Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression is a highly comorbid condition. Both conditions have been associated with decreased quality of life, and research suggests that comorbid PTSD and depression may result in worse quality of life than PTSD alone. However, research is needed to elucidate the effect of comorbidity on a broader variety of quality of life domains. In this study, we used baseline data of 158 male combat Veterans taking part in a PTSD treatment trial and examined the unique relationships between quality of life domains and PTSD symptom clusters, major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Veterans with comorbid PTSD-MDD reported significantly worse satisfaction-related quality of life than those with PTSD alone, although this finding was largely attributable to PTSD numbing symptoms. Subsequent analyses comparing the effect of numbing symptoms to depressive symptoms revealed that depression exerted a stronger influence, although numbing symptoms were still uniquely associated with quality of life. We discuss implications for treatment and research, as well as the need to address negative affect in Veterans with PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Young people who have social disability associated with severe and complex mental health problems are an important group in need of early intervention. Their problems often date back to childhood and become chronic at an early age. Without intervention, the long-term prognosis is often poor and the economic costs very large. There is a major gap in the provision of evidence-based interventions for this group, and therefore new approaches to detection and intervention are needed. This trial provides a definitive evaluation of a new approach to early intervention with young people with social disability and severe and complex mental health problems using social recovery therapy (SRT) over a period of 9 months to improve mental health and social recovery outcomes.Methods: This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, single blind, superiority randomised controlled trial. It is conducted in three sites in the UK: Sussex, Manchester and East Anglia. Participants are aged 16 to 25 and have both persistent and severe social disability (defined as engaged in less than 30 hours per week of structured activity) and severe and complex mental health problems. The target sample size is 270 participants, providing 135 participants in each trial arm. Participants are randomised 1:1 using a web-based randomisation system and allocated to either SRT plus optimised treatment as usual (enhanced standard care) or enhanced standard care alone. The primary outcome is time use, namely hours spent in structured activity per week at 15 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes assess typical mental health problems of the group, including subthreshold psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, depression and anxiety. Time use, secondary outcomes and health economic measures are assessed at 9, 15 and 24 months post-randomisation.Discussion: This definitive trial will be the first to evaluate a novel psychological treatment for social disability and mental health problems in young people presenting with social disability and severe and complex non-psychotic mental health problems. The results will have important implications for policy and practice in the detection and early intervention for this group in mental health services.Trial Registration: Trial Registry: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry.Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN47998710 (registered 29/11/2012).</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Medicaid beneficiaries with severe mental illnesses are a financially disadvantaged group with high rates of smoking and poor cessation outcomes. This study examined whether abstinence-contingent monetary incentives improved outcomes when added to cessation treatments at community mental health centers: prescriber visit for pharmacotherapy only (PV only), prescriber visit and facilitated quitline (PV+Q), and prescriber visit and telephone cognitive-behavioral therapy (PV+CBT).Methods: During 2012-2015, a total of 1,468 adult, daily smoking Medicaid beneficiaries with mental illnesses received Web-based motivational tobacco education. Eligible participants who wanted cessation treatment (N=661) were randomly assigned to treatment with or without abstinence-contingent incentives for four weeks after a quit attempt and assessed for biologically verified abstinence at three, six, nine, and 12 months. To examine intervention effect on abstinence over time, logistic generalized linear models estimated with generalized estimating equations were used, with missing observations imputed as smoking.Results: Participants included smokers with schizophrenia disorders (N=148), bipolar disorder (N=150), major depressive disorder (N=158), and anxiety and other disorders (N=205). There was no significant effect of intervention (PV only, PV+Q, and PV+CBT). However, participants who received monetary incentives were more likely to be abstinent from smoking over time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.77, p=.009). Post hoc comparisons indicated greater abstinence at 12 months in PV+Q with incentives than in PV+Q without incentives (14% versus 4% abstinent, AOR=3.94, p=.014). Treatment participation and cessation outcomes did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups.Conclusions: Abstinence-contingent incentives improved cessation outcomes among financially disadvantaged smokers with mental illness receiving tobacco treatment at community mental health centers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Few studies have examined the practical effectiveness and implementation potential of brief psychotherapies that integrate mental and physical health.Objective: To determine whether an integrated brief cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT), delivered by mental health providers in primary care, would improve depression, anxiety and quality of life for medically ill veterans.Design: Pragmatic patient-randomized trial comparing bCBT to enhanced usual care (EUC).Participants: A total of 302 participants with heart failure and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety were enrolled from two Veterans Health Administration primary care clinics.Intervention: bCBT was delivered to 180 participants by staff mental health providers (n = 19). bCBT addressed physical and emotional health using a modular, skill-based approach. bCBT was delivered in person or by telephone over 4 months. Participants randomized to EUC (n = 122) received a mental health assessment documented in their medical record.Main Measures: Primary outcomes included depression (Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life. Assessments occurred at baseline, posttreatment (4 months), and 8- and 12-month follow-up.Key Results: Participants received, on average, 3.9 bCBT sessions with 63.3% completing treatment (4+ sessions). bCBT improved symptoms of depression (p = 0.004; effect size, d = 0.33) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.37) relative to EUC at posttreatment, with effects maintained at 8 and 12 months. Health-related quality of life improved posttreatment for bCBT participants with COPD but not for heart failure. Health-related quality of life outcomes were not maintained at 12 months.Conclusions: Integrated bCBT is acceptable to participants and providers, appears feasible for delivery in primary care settings and is effective for medically ill veterans with depression and anxiety. Improvements for both depression and anxiety were modest but persistent, and the impact on physical health outcomes was limited to shorter-term effects and COPD participants.

        <ab>Background: Many people with a mental illness are parents caring for dependent children. These children are at greater risk of developing their own mental health concerns compared to other children. Mental health services are opportune places for healthcare professionals to identify clients' parenting status and address the needs of their children. There is a knowledge gap regarding Thai mental health professionals' family-focused knowledge and practices when working with parents with mental illness and their children and families.Methods: This cross -sectional survey study examined the attitudes, knowledge and practices of a sample (n = 349) of the Thai mental health professional workforce (nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists) using a translated version of the Family-Focused Mental Health Practice Questionnaire (FFMHPQ).Results: The majority of clinicians reported no training in family (76.8%) or child-focused practice (79.7%). Compared to other professional groups, psychiatric nurses reported lower scores on almost all aspects of family-focused practice except supporting clients in their parenting role within the context of their mental illness. Social workers scored highest overall including having more workplace support for family-focused practice as well as a higher awareness of family-focused policy and procedures than psychiatrists; social workers also scored higher than psychologists on providing support to families and parents. All mental health care professional groups reported a need for training and inter-professional practice when working with families.Conclusions: The findings indicate an important opportunity for the prevention of intergenerational mental illness in whose parents have mental illness by strengthening the professional development of nurses and other health professionals in child and family-focused knowledge and practice.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Community mental health providers' attitudes toward criminal justice-involved clients with serious mental illness were examined.Methods: A total of 627 Maryland psychiatric rehabilitation program providers responded to a survey (83% response rate). Measures assessed providers' experience with, positive regard for, and perceptions of similarity, with their clients with serious mental illness. Chi-square tests were used to compare providers' attitudes toward clients with and without criminal justice involvement.Results: Providers reported lower regard for criminal justice-involved clients than for clients without such involvement. Providers were less likely to report having a great deal of respect for clients with (79%) versus without (95%) criminal justice involvement. On all items that measured providers' perceived similarity with their clients, less than 50% of providers rated themselves as similar, regardless of clients' criminal justice status.Conclusions: Future research should explore how providers' attitudes toward criminal justice-involved clients influence service delivery for this group.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with the exact neuronal mechanisms causing the disease yet to be discovered. Recent work suggests it is accompanied by neuro-inflammation, characterized, in particular, by microglial activation. However, microglial activation and its involvement in neuro-inflammation and stress-related depressive disorders are far from understood.Methods: We utilized multiple detection methods to detect the neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus of rats after exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS). Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to chronic mild stressors for 12 weeks. Microglial activation and hippocampal neuro-inflammation were detected by using a combinatory approach of in vivo [18F] DPA-714 positron emission computed tomography (PET) imaging, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and translocator protein (TSPO) immunohistochemistry, and detection of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and some inflammatory mediators. Then, the rats were treated with minocycline during the last 4 weeks to observe its effect on hippocampal neuro-inflammation and depressive-like behavior induced by chronic mild stress.Results: The results show that 12 weeks of chronic mild stress induced remarkable depressive- and anxiety-like behavior, simultaneously causing hippocampal microglial activation detected by PET, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting. Likewise, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and upregulation of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-18, were also observed in the hippocampus after exposure to chronic stress. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-4 and IL-10, were also increased in the hippocampus following chronic mild stress, which may hint that chronic stress activates different types of microglia, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, chronic minocycline treatment alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by chronic stress and significantly inhibited microglial activation. Similarly, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the increase of inflammatory mediators were not exhibited or significantly less marked in the minocycline treatment group.Conclusion: These results together indicate that microglial activation mediates the chronic mild stress-induced depressive- and anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal neuro-inflammation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Individuals with severe mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) die 10-25 years earlier than the general population, primarily from premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Contributing factors are complex, but include systemic-related factors of poorly integrated primary care and mental health services. Although evidence-based models exist for integrating mental health care into primary care settings, the evidence base for integrating medical care into specialty mental health settings is limited. Such models are referred to as "reverse" integration. In this paper, we describe the application of an implementation science framework in designing a model to improve CVD outcomes for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) who receive services in a community mental health setting.Methods: Using principles from the theory of planned behavior, focus groups were conducted to understand stakeholder perspectives of barriers to CVD risk factor screening and treatment identify potential target behaviors. We then applied results to the overarching Behavior Change Wheel framework, a systematic and theory-driven approach that incorporates the COM-B model (capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior), to build an intervention to improve CVD risk factor screening and treatment for people with SMI.Results: Following a stepped approach from the Behavior Change Wheel framework, a model to deliver primary preventive care for people that use community mental health settings as their de facto health home was developed. The CRANIUM (cardiometabolic risk assessment and treatment through a novel integration model for underserved populations with mental illness) model focuses on engaging community psychiatrists to expand their scope of practice to become responsible for CVD risk, with significant clinical decision support.Conclusion: The CRANIUM model was designed by integrating behavioral change theory and implementation theory. CRANIUM is feasible to implement, is highly acceptable to, and targets provider behavior change, and is replicable and efficient for helping to integrate primary preventive care services in community mental health settings. CRANIUM can be scaled up to increase CVD preventive care delivery and ultimately improve health outcomes among people with SMI served within a public mental health care system.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression and anxiety are among the largest contributors to the global burden of disease and have negative effects on both the individual and society. Depression and anxiety are very likely to influence the individual's work ability, and up to 40% of the people on sick leave in Denmark have depression and/or anxiety. There is no clear evidence that treatment alone will provide sufficient support for vocational recovery in this group. Integrated vocational and health care services have shown good effects on return to work in other, similar welfare contexts. The purpose of the IBBIS (Integrated Mental Health Care and Vocational Rehabilitation to Individuals on Sick Leave Due to Anxiety and Depression) interventions is to improve and hasten the process of return to employment for people in Denmark on sick leave because of depression and anxiety.Methods/design: This three-arm, parallel-group, randomized superiority trial has been set up to investigate the effectiveness of the IBBIS mental health care intervention and the integrated IBBIS mental health care and IBBIS vocational rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of depression and/or anxiety in Denmark. The trial has an investigator-initiated multicenter design. A total of 603 patients will be recruited from Danish job centers in 4 municipalities and randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: (1) IBBIS mental health care integrated with IBBIS vocational rehabilitation, (2) IBBIS mental health care and standard vocational rehabilitation, and (3) standard mental health care and standard vocational rehabilitation. The primary outcome is register-based return to work at 12 months. The secondary outcome measures are self-assessed level of depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), stress symptoms (Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire), work and social functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), and register-based recurrent sickness absence.Discussion: This study will provide new knowledge on vocational recovery, integrated vocational and health care interventions, and prevention of recurrent sickness absence among people with depression and anxiety. If the effect on return to work is different in the intervention groups, this study can contribute to current knowledge on shared care models for health care and vocational rehabilitation services.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02872051 .

        <ab>Background: Around 17% of people attending UK cardiac rehabilitation programmes have depression. Optimising psychological wellbeing is a rehabilitation goal, but provision of psychological care is limited. We developed and piloted an Enhanced Psychological Care (EPC) intervention embedded within cardiac rehabilitation, aiming to test key areas of uncertainty to inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) and economic evaluation.Methods: An external pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) randomised eight cardiac rehabilitation teams (clusters) to either usual care of cardiac rehabilitation provision (UC), or EPC in addition to UC. EPC comprised mental health care coordination and patient-led behavioural activation with nurse support. Adults eligible for cardiac rehabilitation following an acute coronary syndrome and identified with new-onset depressive symptoms during an initial nurse assessment were eligible. Measures were performed at baseline and 5- and 8-month follow-ups and compared between EPC and UC. Team and participant recruitment and retention rates, and participant outcomes (clinical events, depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, patient experiences, and resource use) were assessed.Results: Eight out of twenty teams were recruited and randomised. Of 614 patients screened, 55 were eligible and 29 took part (5%, 95% CI 3 to 7% of those screened), with 15 patient participants cluster randomised to EPC and 14 to UC. Nurse records revealed that 8/15 participants received the maximum number of EPC sessions offered; and 4/15 received no sessions. Seven out of fifteen EPC participants were referred to another NHS psychological service compared to none in UC. We followed up 27/29 participants at 5 months and 17/21 at 8 months. The mean difference (EPC minus UC) in depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) at follow-up (adjusting for baseline score) was 1.7 (95% CI - 3.8 to 7.3; N = 26) at 5 months and 4.4 (95% CI - 1.4 to 10.2; N = 17) at 8 months.Discussion: While valued by patients and nurses, organisational and workload constraints are significant barriers to EPC implementation. There remains a need to develop and test new models of psychological care within cardiac rehabilitation. Our study offers important data to inform the design of future trials of similar interventions.Trial Registration: ISRCTN34701576 . Registered on 29 May 2014.

        <ab>Objective: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for a host of negative psychosocial outcomes, including depressive and anxious symptoms. Although studies have shown that illness appraisals (e.g., illness intrusiveness [II] and illness uncertainty [IU]) demonstrate consistent associations with such outcomes, few studies have examined positive factors that may relate to better psychosocial outcomes and appraisals. The present study evaluated grit (i.e., perseverance and passion for long-term goals), a novel construct in pediatric psychology, as a positive factor that relates to reduced untoward effects of II and IU on psychosocial outcomes in AYAs with chronic medical conditions.Methods: College students with a chronic medical condition (N = 120) completed questionnaires online, including measures of grit, II, IU, depression, anxiety, and emotional well-being (EWB).Results: The overall path analysis demonstrated that increased grit is directly associated with decreased depressive and anxious symptoms and increased EWB (p &lt; .05). Further, analyses indicated that the positive association between grit and psychosocial outcomes is partially mediated by illness appraisals (p &lt; .05).Conclusions: This study identified grit as a positive personal asset among AYAs with chronic medical conditions. By introducing a novel construct to the AYA literature, the study expands on the integration of positive psychology and pediatric psychology and underscores the need for greater research on the role of grit in chronic medical condition populations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: People with a mental illness experience a greater morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases relative to the general population. A higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours such as smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity and harmful alcohol consumption contribute substantially to this disparity. Despite clinical practice guidelines recommending that mental health services routinely provide care to address these risk behaviours, the provision of such care is consistently reported to be low internationally and in Australia. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial that aims to assess the effectiveness of allocating a clinician within a community mental health service to the specific role of providing assessment, advice and referral for clients' chronic disease risk behaviours.Methods/design: Approximately 540 clients of one community mental health service will be randomised to receive either usual care for chronic disease risks provided in routine consultations or usual care plus an additional face-to-face consultation and follow-up telephone call with a 'healthy lifestyle clinician'. The clinician will assess clients' chronic disease risk behaviours, provide advice to change behaviours, and refer at-risk clients to free telephone coaching services (New South Wales (NSW) Quitline and NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) for specialist behaviour change care. The primary outcomes, regarding referral to and client uptake of the telephone services, will be obtained from the respective services. Telephone interviews of clients at baseline and at 1 and 6 months post baseline follow-ups will assess secondary outcomes: receipt of any assessment, advice and referral from the mental health service; satisfaction with the receipt of such care; satisfaction with the receipt of any care provided by the telephone services; interest and confidence in and perceived importance of changing risk behaviours; and risk behaviour status.Discussion: This study will add to the limited literature regarding effective strategies to address chronic disease prevention among the higher risk population of community mental health clients. The results will inform the development of future policies and service delivery initiatives to address the high prevalence of chronic disease risk behaviours among people with a mental illness.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12616001519448 .

        <ab>There are growing concerns about the impact of digital technologies on children's emotional well-being, particularly regarding fear, anxiety, and depression. The 2 mental health categories of anxiety and depression will be discussed together because there is significant symptom overlap and comorbidity. Early research has explored the impact of traditional media (eg, television, movies) on children's acute fears, which can result in anxieties and related sleep disturbances that are difficult to remedy. More recent research deals with the interactive nature of newer media, especially social media, and their impacts on anxiety and depression. Key topics of inquiry include the following: anxiety and depression associated with technology-based negative social comparison, anxiety resulting from lack of emotion-regulation skills because of substituted digital media use, social anxiety from avoidance of social interaction because of substituted digital media use, anxiety because of worries about being inadequately connected, and anxiety, depression, and suicide as the result of cyberbullying and related behavior. A growing body of research confirms the relationship between digital media and depression. Although there is evidence that greater electronic media use is associated with depressive symptoms, there is also evidence that the social nature of digital communication may be harnessed in some situations to improve mood and to promote health-enhancing strategies. Much more research is needed to explore these possibilities.</ab>

        <ab>This article evaluates an Internet-based early intervention combining online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with electronic peer-to-peer support intended to promote mental health and well-being among combat veterans. We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of 50 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans using a pre and post single-arm design. We evaluated feasibility and changes in mental health symptoms (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), functional status, and attitudes toward treatment seeking at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. A diverse group of veterans was enrolled (26% ethnic minority, 90% male, 66% with income &lt;$30,000/year, 88% with no prior treatment for depression). Participants completed a mean of 4 of 6 lessons (standard deviation = 2.54). From baseline to week 12, there were significant declines in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale score (effect size [ES] = 0.41) and PTSD Checklist-Military version score (ES = 0.53). There were significant improvements in willingness to accept diagnosis (ES = 1.08) and perceived social norms and stigma regarding friends (ES = 1.51). Although lack of a control group is a limitation, the Internet-based program combining CBT-based coping skills training and peer-to-peer support demonstrated potential feasibility and evidenced benefit in symptom remediation for depression and PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Community Partners in Care (CPIC) was a group-randomized study of two approaches to implementing expanded collaborative depression care: Community Engagement and Planning (CEP), a coalition approach, and Resources for Services (RS), a technical assistance approach. Collaborative care networks in both arms involved health care and other agencies in five service sectors. This study examined six- and 12-month outcomes for CPIC participants with serious mental illness.Methods: This secondary analysis focused on low-income CPIC participants from racial-ethnic minority groups with serious mental illness in underresourced Los Angeles communities (N=504). Serious mental illness was defined as self-reported severe depression (≥20 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8) at baseline or a lifetime history of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Logistic and Poisson regression with multiple imputation and response weights, controlling for covariates, was used to model intervention effects.Results: Among CPIC participants, 50% had serious mental illness. Among those with serious mental illness, CEP relative to RS reduced the likelihood of poor mental health-related quality of life (OR=.62, 95% CI=.41-.95) but not depression (primary outcomes); reduced the likelihood of having homelessness risk factors and behavioral health hospitalizations; increased the likelihood of mental wellness; reduced specialty mental health medication and counseling visits; and increased faith-based depression visits (each p&lt;.05) at six months. There were no statistically significant 12-month effects.Conclusions: Findings suggest that a coalition approach to implementing expanded collaborative depression care, compared with technical assistance to individual programs, may reduce short-term behavioral health hospitalizations and improve mental health-related quality of life and some social outcomes for adults with serious mental illness, although no evidence was found for long-term effects in this subsample.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study examined the cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine-based collaborative care model designed to increase rural veterans' engagement in evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Methods: The Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) study used a pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial to examine effects of PTSD care teams located at Veterans Affairs medical centers and supporting primary care providers in satellite clinics. Teams included a nurse care manager, pharmacist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. Effectiveness was estimated with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the Short Form Health Survey for Veterans and Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale. Intervention and health care costs were collected to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.Results: The sample (N=265) included mostly rural, unemployed, middle-aged men with a military service-connected disability for PTSD randomly assigned to TOP or usual care. Only minor improvements in QWB QALYs were found. The TOP intervention was relatively expensive, with costs totaling $2,029 per patient per year. Intervention costs were not offset by reductions in health care utilization costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $185,565 per QALY (interquartile range $57,675 to $395,743).Conclusions: Because of the upfront training costs and the resource-intensive nature of this intervention, associated expenses were high. Although PTSD-specific effectiveness measures were significantly improved, these changes did not translate to QALYs in the main analysis. However, analyses focusing on patient subgroups with comorbid mental disorders indicated greater QALY improvement for TOP at lower cost.</ab>

        <ab>The current study examined relationships among self-reported depression severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, and grade point average (GPA) among student servicemembers and veterans. We asked 422 student servicemembers and veterans (72% male, 86% Caucasian, mean age = 36.29 yr) to complete an anonymous online survey that assessed self-reported GPA, depression severity, PTSD severity, and frequency of academic problems (late assignments, low grades, failed exams, and skipped classes). Female respondents reported a slightly higher GPA than males (3.56 vs 3.41, respectively, p = 0.01). Depression symptoms (beta weight = -0.174, p = 0.03), male sex (beta weight = 0.160, p = 0.01), and younger age (beta weight = 0.155, p = 0.01) were associated with lower GPA but not PTSD symptoms (beta weight = -0.040, p = 0.62), although the interaction of depression and PTSD symptoms showed a nonsignificant inverse relationship with GPA (beta weight =-0.378, p = 0.08). More severe depression was associated with turning in assignments late (beta weight = 0.171, p = 0.03), failed exams (beta weight = 0.188, p = 0.02), and skipped classes (beta weight = 0.254, p = 0.01). The relationship of depression with self-reported GPA was mediated by frequency of failed exams. Results suggest that student servicemembers and veterans with greater emotional distress also report worse academic performance.</ab>

        <ab>Background: To establish the validity and reliability of the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) in service users with schizophrenia, depression and anxiety spectrum disorders in Singapore and estimate SWEMWBS scores across socio-demographic and the three psychiatric diagnostic groups in the sample.Methods: This secondary analysis was conducted using data from a study among outpatients of a tertiary psychiatric hospital. In addition to the SWEMWBS, socio-demographic data and current psychiatric diagnosis were collected. Service users were also administered the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8, Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Positive Mental Health (PMH) instrument. The SWEMWBS was tested for factorial validity, reliability and convergent and divergent validity.Results: In total, 350 service users with a mean (SD) age of 39.1 (11.1) years were included in this study of which 39.4%, 38.9% and 21.7% had schizophrenia, depression and anxiety spectrum disorders, respectively. The single factor structure of the SWEMWBS was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.954, RMSEA = 0.029). The internal consistency reliability was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89). The convergent and divergent validity testing revealed that the SWEMWBS scores had significant moderate to high positive correlations with GAF, SWLS and PMH scores and moderate negative correlations with (PHQ)-8 and (GAD)-7 scores. SWEMWBS scores were higher in married participants (22.2 (5.4) versus never married: 20.7 (5.3) and divorced/separated/widowed: 20.4 (5.1), p = 0.049) and among those with schizophrenia (22.8 (5.5) versus depression:19.6 (4.7) and anxiety spectrum disorders 20.9 (5.2), p &lt; 0.001).Conclusion: These results demonstrate adequate validity and reliability of the SWEMWBS in people with schizophrenia, depression and anxiety spectrum disorders in Singapore.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Understanding the magnitude of mental health problems, particularly life-threatening ones, experienced by transgender and/or gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth can lead to improved management of these conditions. METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify a cohort of 588 transfeminine and 745 transmasculine children (3-9 years old) and adolescents (10-17 years old) enrolled in integrated health care systems in California and Georgia. Ten male and 10 female referent cisgender enrollees were matched to each TGNC individual on year of birth, race and/ or ethnicity, study site, and membership year of the index date (first evidence of gender nonconforming status). Prevalence ratios were calculated by dividing the proportion of TGNC individuals with a specific mental health diagnosis or diagnostic category by the corresponding proportion in each reference group by transfeminine and/or transmasculine status, age group, and time period before the index date. RESULTS: Common diagnoses for children and adolescents were attention deficit disorders (transfeminine 15%; transmasculine 16%) and depressive disorders (transfeminine 49%; transmasculine 62%), respectively. For all diagnostic categories, prevalence was severalfold higher among TGNC youth than in matched reference groups. Prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for history of self-inflicted injury in adolescents 6 months before the index date ranged from 18 (95% CI 4.4-82) to 144 (95% CI 36-1248). The corresponding range for suicidal ideation was 25 (95% CI 14 - 45) to 54 (95% CI 18-218). CONCLUSIONS: TGNC youth may present with mental health conditions requiring immediate evaluation and implementation of clinical, social, and educational gender identity support measures.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of burnout, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms and attitudes toward substance use in medical students as well as their evolution during the 4 years of medical school.Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) between September and December 2016. In total, 176 out of 412 eligible medical students responded. The survey was anonymous and administered via e-mail link to an electronic form. The study included general socio-demographic questions and standardized validated tools to measure depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9), burnout (Burnout Measure), anxiety (GAD-7), alcohol use (AUDIT), and substance abuse (DAST-10) as well as questions pertaining to attitudes toward recreational substance use.Results: Overall, 23.8% of medical students reported depressive symptomatology, with 14.5% having suicidal ideations. Forty-three percent were found to have burnout. Those who screened positive for burnout were more likely to be males, to be living away from their parents, and to have experienced a stressful life event during the last year. With the exception of burnout, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of depression or anxiety among the 4 years of medical school. There was a significant difference in alcohol use, illicit substance use, and marijuana use during the four medical school years.Conclusions: The results of this study show high rates of depression, burnout, and suicidal ideation among medical students from the Middle East region. Increased rates of substance use were detected as well as a more tolerant attitude toward substance use in general, specifically cannabis. It is crucial that medical educators and policymakers keep tackling the complex multifactorial mental health issues affecting medical students and design effective solutions and support systems.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes.Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach.Results: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity.Conclusions: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cranial electrical stimulation (CES) is increasingly popular as a treatment, yet its clinical benefit is unclear.Purpose: To review evidence about the benefits and harms of CES for adult patients with chronic painful conditions, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.Data Sources: Several databases from inception to 10 October 2017 without language restrictions and references from experts, prior reviews, and manufacturers.Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials of CES versus usual care or sham CES that reported pain, depression, anxiety, or sleep outcomes in any language.Data Extraction: Single-reviewer extraction checked by another; dual independent quality assessment; strength-of-evidence grading by the first author with subsequent group discussion.Data Synthesis: Twenty-eight articles from 26 randomized trials met eligibility criteria. The 2 trials that compared CES with usual care were small, and neither reported a statistically significant benefit in pain or anxiety outcomes for patients with fibromyalgia or anxiety, respectively. Fourteen trials with sham or placebo controls involving patients with painful conditions, such as headache, neuromuscular pain, or musculoskeletal pain, had conflicting results. Four trials done more than 40 years ago and 1 from 2014 provided low-strength evidence of a possible modest benefit compared with sham treatments in patients with anxiety and depression. Trials in patients with insomnia (n = 2), insomnia and anxiety (n = 1), or depression (n = 3) had inconclusive or conflicting results. Low-strength evidence suggested that CES does not cause serious side effects.Limitation: Most trials had small sample sizes and short durations; all had high risk of bias due to inadequate blinding.Conclusion: Evidence is insufficient that CES has clinically important effects on fibromyalgia, headache, neuromusculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint pain, depression, or insomnia; low-strength evidence suggests modest benefit in patients with anxiety and depression.Primary Funding Source: Veterans Affairs Quality Enhancement Research Initiative.

        <ab>Objective: Patient nonadherence to psychopharmacological treatment is a significant barrier to effective treatment. The therapeutic relationship is known to be a critical component of effective psychological treatment, but it has received limited study. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the role of the therapeutic relationship in the delivery of effective psychopharmacological treatment.Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Ingenta, and the Web of Science-Science Citation Index were searched, including reference lists of found articles. Meta-analytic methods were used to examine the association between the physician-patient therapeutic relationship and outcomes in psychopharmacological treatment.Results: Eight independent studies of psychopharmacological treatment reported in nine articles met the inclusion criterion (1,065 participants) of being an empirically based study in which measures of the therapeutic relationship were administered and psychiatric treatment outcomes were assessed. The overall average weighted effect size for the association between the therapeutic relationship and treatment outcomes was z=.30 (95% confidence interval=.20-.39), demonstrating a statistically significant, moderate effect.Conclusions: Findings indicate that a positive therapeutic relationship or alliance between the physician and the psychiatric patient is associated with patient improvement over the course of psychopharmacological treatment. Results suggest that more attention should be paid to psychiatrist communication skills that may enhance the therapeutic alliance in psychopharmacological treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mental health disorders are common and disabling for young people because of the potential to disrupt key developmental tasks. Implementation of evidence-based psychosocial therapies in New Zealand is limited, owing to the inaccessibility, length, and cost of training in these therapies. Furthermore, most therapies address one problem area at a time, although comorbidity and changing clinical needs commonly occur in practice. A more flexible approach is needed. The Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems (MATCH-ADTC) is designed to overcome these challenges; it provides a range of treatment modules addressing different problems, within a single training program. A clinical trial of MATCH-ADTC in the USA showed that MATCH-ADTC outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatment on several clinical measures. We aim to replicate these findings and evaluate the impact of providing training and supervision in MATCH-ADTC to: (1) improve clinical outcomes for youth attending mental health services; (2) increase the amount of evidence-based therapy content; (3) increase the efficiency of service delivery.Methods: This is an assessor-blinded multi-site effectiveness randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurs at two levels: (1) clinicians (≥60) are randomized to intervention or usual care; (2) youth participants (7-14 years old) accepted for treatment in child and adolescent mental health services (with a primary disorder that includes anxiety, depression, trauma-related symptoms, or disruptive behavior) are randomly allocated to receive MATCH-ADTC or usual care. Youth participants are recruited from 'mainstream', Māori-specific, and Pacific-specific child and adolescent mental health services. We originally planned to recruit 400 youth participants, but this has been revised to 200 participants. Centralized computer randomization ensures allocation concealment. The primary outcome measures are: (i) the difference in trajectory of change of clinical severity between groups (using the parent-rated Brief Problem Monitor); (ii) clinicians' use of evidence-based treatment procedures during therapy sessions; (iii) total time spent by clinicians delivering therapy.Discussion: If MATCH-ADTC demonstrates effectiveness it could offer a practical efficient method to increase access to evidence-based therapies, and improve outcomes for youth attending secondary care services.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12614000297628 .</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Approximately three to six months after returning from deployment, military service members complete the Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (PDHRA), which includes screens for alcohol misuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To determine whether Army Reserve Component (RC) members (Army National Guard and Army Reserve) with positive screening scores on the PDHRA receive needed care, the investigators examined the association between positive scores and enrollment and utilization of care ("linkage") in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as well as rescreening scores, diagnosis, and behavioral treatment in VHA.Methods: Mixed-effects regression models were used to predict linkage to VHA within six months after RC members (N=73,164) completed the PDHRA, with alcohol misuse, depression, and PTSD screen scores as key independent variables. Regression models were stratified by gender and National Guard versus Reserve status. Among those who linked to VHA (N=25,168), screening scores and subsequent diagnosis and treatment in VHA were also examined.Results: Army RC members with positive PTSD and depression screening scores were more likely than those with negative screens to link to VHA, and most (54%-84%) received VHA treatment once diagnosed. Positive screens for alcohol misuse were associated with linkage to VHA for men but not for women, and treatment rates for alcohol use disorders were relatively low (0%-25%) for both men and women diagnosed as having an alcohol use disorder.Conclusions: The finding that Army RC members with greater indications of behavioral health problems linked to VHA is encouraging. However, more outreach and treatment engagement strategies could be directed to those with alcohol use disorder, particularly women.</ab>

        <ab>Study Question: To what extent are pain symptoms, psychological variables (anxiety, depression and distress) and emotion regulation associated with women's health in endometriosis?Summary Answer: Physical pain symptoms and emotion regulation difficulties via psychological stress negatively affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of women living with endometriosis.What Is Known Already: There are some missing links in the definitive treatment and recovery from endometriosis. Women with chronic pain report a decrease in HRQoL and an increase in the frequency of psychological problems, but little is known about the complex relationship between these variables in the context of endometriosis.Study Design, Size, Duration: This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2014 and October 2015 on 193 women living with endometriosis.Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: The sample consisted of women with a medically confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis who received treatment at the participating clinic. All participants completed the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Spearman's rank correlation was used to explore the associations between the measured variables, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed mediation models.Main Results and the Role Of Chance: The response rate was 46%. In this study, 54.79% of the participants presented with anxiety and 20.3% with depressive symptoms. Pain symptoms, psychological variables and difficulties in emotion regulation were negatively associated with HRQoL. Mediation models revealed that physical pain, psychological stress and difficulties in emotion regulation explained 55% of the variance in the overall HRQoL, 41% of the variation in physical and 55% of the variation in mental HRQoL. Accordingly, severe physical pain (β = -0.39, P &lt; 0.001) was directly, and difficulties in emotion regulation (β = -0.38, P &lt; 0.001) was indirectly related to deterioration in overall HRQoL. Physical pain had a higher direct standardized effect (β = -0.51, P &lt; 0.001) on physical HRQoL, and had no significant direct effect on mental HRQoL. Furthermore, both physical pain (β = -0.07, P &lt; 0.001) and difficulties in emotion regulation (β = -0.46, P &lt; 0.001) had a significant indirect effect on mental HRQoL.Limitations, Reasons For Caution: The data were heterogeneous with regard to the severity of endometriosis. The validity of this cross-sectional study is limited to correlations; therefore, further longitudinal studies using a more representative sample are needed to explore valid causal relationships.Wider Implications Of the Findings: The results of this study indicate that HRQoL can be improved through pain management and emotion regulation strategies. The authors believe that HRQoL would increase with concomitant application of physical treatment and psychological care.Study Funding/competing Interest(s): There were no external funding sources for this study, and the authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.Trial Registration Number: Not applicable.</ab>

        <ab>Study Question: Which of the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is the most efficient to assess quality of life in women suffering from endometriosis?Summary Answer: Although EHP-5 and EQ-5D instruments had an excellent responsiveness, EHP-5 has a better discriminative ability than EQ-5 to measure health-related quality of life (HrQoL).What Is Known Already: Proper measurement of HrQoL is important in endometriosis. While many quality of life instruments are available, few have been completely validated in endometriosis. The EHP-5 and the EQ-5D are short and practical scales, which may be useful. Literature is lacking to determine which one is the most suitable in clinical practice or in clinical research.Study Design, Size, Duration: This prospective and observational study conducted between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 included a total of 253 consecutive women with proven endometriosis, undergoing medical or surgical treatment, in 2 French tertiary care centers.Participants/materials, Settings, Methods: Women over 18 years consulting for painful symptoms of at least 3 months' duration or for infertility, with endometriosis proven histologically or radiologically, were requested to fill in the 2 scales before (T0) and 12 months after treatment (T1). Construct validity consisted in testing presupposed relationships between the scales and the characteristics of the patients or the endometriosis. Responsiveness to change was calculated for all patients and in each treatment group. Effect sizes were used according to Cohen's d method.Main Results and the Role Of Chance: A total of 216 women filled in completely all the questionnaires at T0 and 133 (61.6%) at T1. EHP-5 and EQ-5D had good discriminative abilities regarding the patients' symptoms, with significant superiority of EHP-5 concerning three of the nine hypotheses. The largest difference was that calculated for the 'intensity of dysmenorrhea' using the Visual Analogic Scale, with respectively effect size from Cohen's d (ES) = 0.86 95% CI (0.54-1.17) for EHP-5 versus 0.48 95% CI (0.16-0.79) for EQ-5D. There were no differences in EHP-5 or in EQ-5D scores between subgroups according to the characteristics of endometriosis. Overall responsiveness was excellent and equivalent for EHP-5 and for EQ-5D, with, respectively, ES = 0.81 95% CI (0.56-1.56) versus ES = 0.95 95% CI (0.68-1.20). In subgroup analyses, EHP-5 was responsive in case of medical treatment with ES = 0.93 95% CI (0.07-1.70), whereas EQ-5D was not, ES = 0.73 95% CI (-0.06-1.47).Limitations, Reasons For Caution: Our study population included patients with symptomatic and mainly severe forms of endometriosis, which may suggest a spectrum bias. The evaluation of responsiveness in case of medical treatment was based on a small number of patients, which limits the interpretation of the difference found between the two scales in this subgroup.Wider Implications Of the Findings: EHP-5 is a simple, efficient and valid tool for evaluating quality of life in daily practice and also valuable to provide a primary outcome in clinical studies evaluating treatment efficacy.Study Funding/competing Interest(s): This work was funded by the Direction à la Recherche Clinique et à l'Innovation of Versailles, France. The authors have no conflicts of interest.Trial Register Number: None.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: This study examined whether psychiatric patients assigned to community treatment orders (CTOs), outpatient commitment in Victoria, Australia, have a greater need for treatment to protect their health and safety than patients not assigned to CTOs. It also considered whether such treatment is provided in a least restrictive manner-that is, in a way that contributes to reduced use of psychiatric hospitalization.Methods: The sample included 11,424 patients first placed on a CTO between 2000 and 2010, and 16,161 patients not placed on a CTO. Need for treatment was independently assessed with the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) at hospital admission and at discharge. Ordinary least-squares and Poisson regressions were used to assess savings in hospital days attributable to CTO placement.Results: HoNOS ratings indicated that at admission and discharge, the CTO cohort's need for treatment exceeded that of the non-CTO cohort, particularly in areas indicating potential dangerous behavior. When analyses adjusted for the propensity to be selected into the CTO cohort and other factors, the mean duration of an inpatient episode was 4.6 days shorter for the CTO cohort than for the non-CTO cohort, and a reduction of 10.4 days per inpatient episode was attributable to each CTO placement.Conclusions: CTO placement may have helped patients with a greater need for treatment to experience shorter hospital stays. Whether the CTO directly enabled the fulfillment of unsought but required treatment needs that protected patient health and safety is a question that needs to be addressed in future research.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Although primary care is associated with better outcomes, many individuals with serious mental illness do not receive general medical services. This study examined patient-level factors associated with not having outpatient general medical visits among individuals with serious mental illness in California.Methods: The study analyzed administrative, pharmacy, and billing data for 56,895 Medicaid-enrolled adults with serious mental illness treated in community mental health clinics between October 1, 2010, and September 20, 2011. Poisson regression estimated independent associations between predictor variables and outpatient general medical visits.Results: One-third of participants (34%) had no outpatient general medical visits during the study. In multivariate analyses, younger adults (ages 18-27) were less likely than older groups to have such a visit (adjusted relative risk [ARR]=1.07 and 1.19, respectively, for ages 28-47 and 48-67). Women were more likely than men to have such a visit (ARR=1.29). Compared with whites, blacks were less likely to have an outpatient general medical visit (ARR=.93). Rural dwellers were less likely than urban dwellers to have such a visit (ARR=.64). Persons with drug or alcohol use disorders were less likely than those without such disorders to have an outpatient general medical visit (ARR=.95), and those with schizophrenia were less likely than those with any other psychiatric disorder examined to have such a visit.Conclusions: Individuals with serious mental illness had low use of outpatient general medical services. Integrated care models are needed to engage these individuals and eliminate disparities in morbidity and mortality.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The prevalence of fathers' depression and anxiety in the perinatal period (i.e. from conception to 1 year after birth) is approximately 5-10%, and 5-15%, respectively; their children face increased risk of adverse emotional and behavioural outcomes, independent of maternal mental health. Critically, fathers can be protective against the development of maternal perinatal mental health problems and their effects on child outcomes. Preventing and treating paternal mental health problems and promoting paternal psychological wellbeing may therefore benefit the family as a whole. This study examined fathers' views and direct experiences of paternal perinatal mental health.Methods: Men in the Born and Bred in Yorkshire (BaBY) epidemiological prospective cohort who met eligibility criteria (baby born &lt;12 months; completed Mental Health and Wellbeing [MHWB] questionnaires) were invited to participate. Those expressing interest (n = 42) were purposively sampled to ensure diversity of MHWB scores. In-depth interviews were conducted at 5-10 months postpartum with 19 men aged 25-44 years. The majority were first-time fathers and UK born; all lived with their partner. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Four themes were identified: 'legitimacy of paternal stress and entitlement to health professionals' support', 'protecting the partnership', 'navigating fatherhood', and, 'diversity of men's support networks'. Men largely described their 'stress' with reference to exhaustion, poor concentration and irritability. Despite feeling excluded by maternity services, fathers questioned their entitlement to support, noting that services are pressured and 'should' be focused on mothers. Men emphasised the need to support their partner and protect their partnership as central to the successfully navigation of fatherhood; they used existing support networks where available but noted the paucity of tailored support for fathers.Conclusions: Fathers experience psychological distress in the perinatal period but question the legitimacy of their experiences. Men may thus be reluctant to express their support needs or seek help amid concerns that to do so would detract from their partner's needs. Resources are needed that are tailored to men, framed around fatherhood, rather than mental health or mental illness, and align men's self-care with their role as supporter and protector. Further research is needed to inform how best to identify and manage both parents' mental health needs and promote their psychological wellbeing, in the context of achievable models of service delivery.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Level of functioning is positively associated with subjective quality of life for people with severe mental illness, but a detailed relationship between functioning and satisfaction with various life domains is largely unknown, and this gap prompted this study.Methods: Demographic and clinical data were obtained from 149 patients engaged with 12 assertive community treatment teams in Norway. Multivariate regression analyses were used to explore associations between subjective quality of life and patient characteristics.Results: Analyses confirmed positive associations between quality of life and age, functioning, and weekly contact with family and friends and a negative association with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Positive associations between several areas of practical and social functioning and satisfaction with related life domains also were found.Conclusions: Although a causal direction of the associations between functioning and life satisfaction has not been determined in this study, the positive findings might indicate that programs aiming to improve functioning could affect patients' quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine the trajectories of caregiver psychological responses in the year following their child's hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT), and whether cognitive and social processing strategies differentiated between trajectories.Method: One hundred and eight caregivers randomized to the control condition of a cognitive-behavioral intervention study completed measures of distress, coping, and social support at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year post HSCT of their child.Results: The majority reported moderate or low anxiety, depression, or distress that decreased over time, but a small group demonstrated high anxiety, depression, or distress that persisted or increased over time. Maladaptive coping was highest among caregivers in the high-persistent distress subgroup compared with the moderate-decreasing and low-stable groups. Adaptive coping was minimally associated with trajectory subgroups.Conclusions: Screening HSCT caregivers for distress and maladaptive coping may be useful in identifying caregivers likely to experience persistently high distress who may benefit from psychological intervention.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Low use of anti-depressant medication, poor doctor-patient communication, and persistent stigma are key barriers to the treatment of depression in Hispanics. Common concerns include fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking medications and seeking mental health treatments. In 2014, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) funded the Depression Screening and Education: Options to Reduce Barriers to Treatment (DESEO) project to implement an education intervention designed to increase disease literacy and dispel myths about depression and its treatment among Hispanic patients thus reducing stigma and increasing treatment engagement. Methods: The DESEO study utilized a one-group pretest-posttest design to assess the effects a culturally-adapted Depression Education Intervention's (DEI) on depression knowledge, stigma, and engagement in treatment in a sample of 350 Hispanic primary care patients with depression. The DEI utilized a fotonovela, a health education tool available in English and Spanish that uses posed photographs, captions, and soap opera narratives to raise awareness about depression and depression treatments. Results: Participants reported significant decreases in depression symptoms and reported stigma about mental health care. Additionally, participants reported increased knowledge of depression yet greater negative perceptions about antidepressant medication. Finally, 89.5% of participants reported entering some form of treatment at follow-up. Conclusions: Culturally adapted depression education shows promise in increasing understanding of depression, decreasing stigma, and increasing treatment engagement among Hispanic patients in a community-based health center. Results have implications for practice in addressing common concerns about depression treatments which include fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking psychotropic medications. Trial registration: The study was retrospectively registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02491034 July 2, 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Expressive writing involves writing about stressful or traumatic experiences. Despite trials in people with advanced disease, no systematic review to date has critiqued the evidence on expressive writing in this population. To synthesise the evidence of the effects of expressive writing on pain, sleep, depression and anxiety in people with advanced disease. Methods: A systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO and PubMed were searched from January 1986 to March 2018. Other sources included clinical data registers and conference proceedings. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials that assessed the impact of an intervention involving expressive writing for adults with advanced disease and/or studies involving linguistic analysis on the expressive writing output. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool was used to assess the level of evidence for the outcomes of interest. The protocol of this systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017058193). Results: Six eligible studies with a total of 288 participants were identified, including four randomised controlled trials. All of the trials were in cancer and recruited predominantly women. None of the interventions were tailored to the population. Studies had methodological shortcomings and evidence was generally of low quality. Combined analysis of the four trials, involving 214 participants in total, showed no clear difference in the effect of expressive writing on sleep, anxiety or depression compared to an active control. Pain was not evaluated in the trials. In contrast, analysis of the four studies that included linguistic analysis alluded to linguistic mechanisms for potential effects. Conclusion: Although the trial results suggest there is no benefit in expressive writing for people with advanced disease, the current evidence is limited. There is a need for more rigorous trials. It would be of benefit first to undertake exploratory research in trial design including how best to measure impact and in tailoring of the intervention to address the specific needs of people with advanced disease. Trial registration: The protocol of this systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO, which can be accessed here (registration number: CRD42017058193).</ab>

        <ab>Sequential intercept mapping, a community-based application of the sequential intercept model, was recently adapted in Ohio to address the complex challenge of the opioid crisis. Sequential intercept mapping for opioids provides a framework for criminal justice, mental health and addictions treatment providers, family members and opioid-involved individuals, and other stakeholders to develop community-based responses that emphasize prevention, regulation, and treatment for opioid dependency, with a goal of reducing unintended deaths and overdoses. The authors describe a promising approach to using sequential intercept mapping to address the opioid crisis.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: High-quality mental health care requires written strategies to set a vision for the future, yet, there is limited systematic information available on the monitoring and evaluation of such strategies. The aim of this nationwide study is to evaluate local mental health strategies in community-based mental health services provided by municipalities.Design and setting: Mental health strategy documents were gathered through an online search and an e-mail survey of the local authorities of all Finnish mainland municipalities (n = 320).Participants: Out of 320 municipalities, documents for 129 municipalities (63 documents) were included in the study.Intervention: The documents obtained (n = 63) were evaluated against the World Health Organization checklist for mental health strategies and policies.Main outcome measures: Evaluation of the process, operations and content of the documents, against 31 indicators in the checklist.Results: Out of 320 Finnish municipalities, 40% (n = 129) had a mental health strategy document available and 33% (n = 104) had a document that was either in preparation or being updated. In these documents, priorities, targets and activities were clearly described. Nearly all (99%) of the documents suggested a commitment to preventative work, and 89% mentioned a dedication to developing community-based care. The key shortfalls identified were the lack of consideration of human rights (0%), the limited consideration of research (5%) and the lack of financial planning (28%) to successfully execute the plans. Of the documents obtained, 60% covered both mental health and substance abuse issues.Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited evidence base on health care strategy evaluations. Further research is needed to understand the potential impact of policy analysis.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Outcome measures are rarely available for surveillance and system performance monitoring for mental disorders and addictions. Our study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and face validity of routinely measuring the mortality gap in the Canadian context at the provincial and regional levels using the methods and data available to the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Methods: We used longitudinal data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, which also provides aggregated data to the CCDSS. This includes data from the health insurance registry physician claims and the hospital discharge abstract for all mental disorder diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 290-319 or ICD-10 F00-F99). Patients were defined as having had received a mental disorder diagnosis at least once during the year. Life expectancy was measured using Chiang's method for abridged life tables, complemented by the Hsieh method for adjustment of the last age interval. Results: We found a lower life expectancy among psychiatric patients of 8 years for men and 5 years for women. For patients with schizophrenia, life expectancy was lowered by 12 years for men and 8 years for women. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the most common causes of premature death. Findings were consistent across time and regions of the province. Lower estimates of the mortality gap, compared with literature, could be explained by the inclusion of primary care patients and methods. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using administrative data to measure the impact of current and future mental health plans in Canada provided the techniques can be replicated in other Canadian provinces.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Les mesures des résultats sont rarement disponibles pour le rendement de la surveillance et du système contrôlant les maladies mentales et les dépendances. Notre étude vise à démontrer la faisabilité et la validité apparente de mesurer couramment les disparités de mortalité dans le contexte canadien à l'échelle provinciale et régionale, à l'aide des méthodes et des données offertes par le Système national de surveillance des maladies chroniques (SNSMC) de l'Agence de la santé publique du Canada. Méthodes : Nous avons utilisé des données longitudinales du Système intégré de surveillance des maladies chroniques du Québec, qui fournit aussi des données cumulatives au SNSMC. Ceci comprend des données de facturation des médecins du registre de l'assurance maladie et des sommaires des congés d'hôpitaux pour tous les diagnostics de trouble mental (Classification internationale des maladies [CIM]-9 290-319 ou CIM-10 F00-F99). Les patients ont été définis comme ayant reçu un diagnostic de trouble mental au moins une fois durant l'année. L'espérance de vie a été mesurée à l'aide de la méthode de Chiang pour les tables de mortalité abrégées, complétée par la méthode de Hsieh pour ajustement du dernier intervalle d'âge. Résultats : Nous avons constaté chez les patients psychiatriques une espérance de vie moins élevée de 8 ans pour les hommes et de 5 ans pour les femmes. Pour les patients souffrant de schizophrénie, l'espérance de vie était moins élevée de 12 ans pour les hommes et de 8 ans pour les femmes. La maladie cardiovasculaire et le cancer étaient les causes les plus communes de décès prématuré. Les résultats étaient cohérents à travers le temps et les régions de la province. Les estimations moins élevées des disparités de mortalité, comparativement à la littérature, pourraient s'expliquer par l'inclusion des patients et des méthodes des soins primaires. Conclusions : Notre étude démontre la faisabilité d'utiliser des données administratives pour mesurer l'impact des plans de santé mentale présents et futurs au Canada, si les techniques peuvent être reproduites dans d'autres provinces canadiennes</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Kraepelin considered declining course a hallmark of schizophrenia, but others have suggested that outcomes usually stabilize or improve after treatment initiation. The authors investigated this question in an epidemiologically defined cohort with psychotic disorders followed for 20 years after first hospitalization.Method: The Suffolk County Mental Health Project recruited first-admission patients with psychosis from all inpatient units of Suffolk County, New York (response rate, 72%). Participants were assessed in person six times over two decades; 373 completed the 20-year follow-up (68% of survivors); 175 had schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), psychotic symptoms, and mood symptoms were rated at each assessment. Month 6, when nearly all participants were discharged from the index hospitalization, was used as a reference.Results: In the schizophrenia group, mean GAF scores declined from 49 at month 6 to 36 at year 20. Negative and positive symptoms also worsened (Cohen's d values, 0.45-0.73). Among participants without schizophrenia, GAF scores were higher initially (a mean of approximately 64) but declined by 9 points over the follow-up period. Worsening began between years 5 and 8. Neither aging nor changes in antipsychotic treatment accounted for the declines. In all disorders, depression improved and manic symptoms remained low across the 20 years.Conclusions: The authors found substantial symptom burden across disorders that increased with time and ultimately may undo initial treatment gains. Previous studies have suggested that better health care delivery models may preempt this decline. In the United States, these care needs are often not met, and addressing them is an urgent priority.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Low mood is a common mental health problem with significant health consequences. Studies have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for low mood and anxiety when delivered one-to-one by an expert practitioner. However, access to this talking therapy is often limited and waiting lists can be long, although a range of low-intensity interventions that can increase access to services are available. These include guided self-help materials delivered via books, classes and online packages. This project aims to pilot a randomized controlled trial of an online CBT-based life skills course with community-based individuals experiencing low mood and anxiety. Methods: Individuals with elevated symptoms of depression will be recruited directly from the community via online and newspaper advertisements. Participants will be remotely randomized to receive either immediate access or delayed access to the Living Life to the Full guided online CBT-based life skills package, with telephone or email support provided whilst they use the online intervention. The primary end point will be at 3 months post-randomization, at which point the delayed-access group will be offered the intervention. Levels of depression, anxiety, social functioning and satisfaction will be assessed. Discussion: This pilot study will test the trial design, and ability to recruit and deliver the intervention. Drop-out rates will be assessed and the completion and acceptability of the package will be investigated. The study will also inform a sample size power calculation for a subsequent substantive randomized controlled trial. Trial Registration: ISRCTN ISRCTN12890709.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundThe majority of survivors of mass violence live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).AimsTo synthesise empirical findings for psychological interventions for children and adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression in LMICs affected by mass violence.MethodRandomised controlled trials with children and adolescents with symptoms of PTSD and/or depression in LMICs were identified. Overall, 21 812 records were found through July 2016 in the Medline, PsycINFO and PILOTS databases; 21 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed according to recommended guidelines.ResultsTwenty-one studies were included. Active treatments for PTSD yielded large pre-treatment to post-treatment changes (g = 1.15) and a medium controlled effect size (g = 0.57). Effect sizes were similar at follow-up. Active treatments for depression produced small to medium effect sizes. Finally, after adjustment for publication bias, the imputed uncontrolled and controlled effect sizes for PTSD were medium and small respectively.ConclusionsPsychological interventions may be effective in treating paediatric PTSD in LMICs. It appears that more targeted approaches are needed for depressive responses.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adolescents with depression identified in primary care settings often have limited treatment options beyond antidepressant (AD) therapy. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program among depressed adolescents who declined or quickly stopped using ADs. METHODS: A total of 212 youth with depression were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus brief individual CBT. Clinical outcomes included depression-free days (DFDs) and estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were adjusted to 2008 US dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing CBT to TAU were calculated over 12- and 24-month follow-up periods. RESULTS: Youth randomly assigned to CBT had 26.8 more DFDs (P = .044) and 0.067 more QALYs (P = .044) on average compared with TAU over 12 months. Total costs were $4976 less (P = .025) by the end of the 24-month follow-up among youth randomly assigned to CBT. Total costs per DFD were -$51 (ICER = -$51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -$394 to $9) at 12 months and -$115 (ICER = -$115; 95% CI: -$1090 to -$6) at 24 months. Total costs per QALY were -$20 282 (ICER = -$20 282; 95% CI: -$156 741 to $3617) at 12 months and -$45 792 (ICER = -$45 792; 95% CI: -$440 991 to -$2731) at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Brief primary care CBT among youth declining AD therapy is cost-effective by widely accepted standards in depression treatment. CBT becomes dominant over TAU over time, as revealed by a statistically significant cost offset at the end of the 2-year follow-up.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pregnant women with depression and/or anxiety prior to pregnancy are at higher risk of preterm birth, breastfeeding problems, postpartum depression, and disruption of the mother-infant attachment. It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety.Methods/design: The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women ≥18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1.Discussion: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of depression.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02833519 .

        <ab>Background: The impact of humanitarian disasters upon mental health is well recognised. The evidence for psychological interventions for mental health is mounting, but few interventions have been rigorously tested in humanitarian settings. To be sustainable in humanitarian settings interventions need to be short, simple, deliverable by nonspecialists under supervision, and adopt a transdiagnostic approach where an array of mental health outcomes are addressed simultaneously. These elements have been incorporated into the newly developed WHO Problem Management Plus (PM+) Group intervention. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the locally adapted PM+ Group intervention for women in Swat, Pakistan.Methods: This PM+ Group trial is a two-arm, single-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a community-based setting with women in rural Pakistan. PM+ is delivered in partnership with the Lady Health Worker (LHW) Programme which provides community-based health care to women in Pakistan. Thirty-four LHW clusters will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio using a permuted-block randomisation method. Participants screened and found to meet the inclusion criteria will be allocated to either the PM+ intervention group (n = 306), or the control arm (n = 306). The manualised PM+ intervention involves five sessions, each lasting 3 h, and introduces four strategies applied by participants to problems that they are facing. It is delivered by local female facilitators with a minimum of 16 years of education who are provided with targeted training and supervision. The primary outcome is individual psychological distress, measured by levels of anxiety and depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 20 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes include major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, levels of social support, levels of functioning, and economic effectiveness. Intervention acceptability will be explored through an embedded qualitative study.Discussion: The PM+ Group trial will provide important evidence on the effectiveness of an empirically supported psychological treatment delivered by nonspecialists in a humanitarian setting. If proven effective, the qualitative component will inform strategies for PM+ Group scale-up in health systems in other humanitarian settings.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, identifier: ACTRN12616000037404.

        <ab>Objective: Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) co-occur frequently with anxiety and depressive disorders, but the nature of their relationship and their impact on severity of anxiety and depressive disorders is poorly understood. In a large sample of patients with anxiety and depressive disorders, we assessed the frequency of OCS, defined as a Young Adult Self-Report Scale-obsessive-compulsive symptoms score &gt;7. The associations between OCS and severity of anxiety and/or depressive disorders were examined, and it was investigated whether OCS predict onset, relapse, and persistence of anxiety and depressive disorders.Methods: Data were obtained from the third (at 2-year follow-up) and fourth wave (at 4-year follow-up) of data collection in the Netherlands Study of Anxiety and Depression cohort, including 469 healthy controls, 909 participants with a remitted disorder, and 747 participants with a current anxiety and/or depressive disorder.Results: OCS were present in 23.6% of the total sample, most notably in those with current combined anxiety and depressive disorders. In patients with a current disorder, OCS were associated with severity of this disorder. Moreover, OCS predicted (1) first onset of anxiety and/or depressive disorders in healthy controls (odds ratio [OR], 5.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 29.14), (2) relapse in those with remitted anxiety and/or depressive disorders (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.55 to 3.46), and (3) persistence in patients with the combination of current anxiety and depressive disorders (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 2.54 to 7.70) within the 2-year follow-up period Conclusions: OCS are closely related to both the presence and severity of anxiety and depressive disorders and affect their course trajectories. Hence, OCS might be regarded as a course specifier signaling unfavorable outcomes. This specifier may be useful in clinical care to adapt and intensify treatment in individual patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Adolescence is a period of elevated stress sensitivity, which places adolescents at increased risk of developing mental health problems such as burnout, depression, anxiety, and externalizing problems. Early intervention of psychological needs and low-threshold care addressing such needs may prevent this dysfunctional development. Schools may provide an important environment to identify and address psychological needs. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of low-threshold school-based skills-training programs promoting the mental health of adolescents and to examine moderators of the effectiveness.Methods: A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of two school-based skills-training programs aiming to promote mental health by improving either skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills. A multi-informant (i.e., students, parents, and trainers) and multi-method (i.e., questionnaires and physiological measurements) approach will be used to assess program targets (skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills), direct program outcomes (performance or social anxiety) and mental health outcomes (i.e., stress, internalizing and externalizing problems, self-esteem and well-being), as well as specific moderators (i.e., student, parent and program characteristics, social support, perfectionism, stressful life events, perceived parental pressure, positive parenting behavior, treatment alliance and program integrity).Discussion: The current study will provide information on the effectiveness of school-based skills-training programs. It is of crucial importance that the school environment can provide students with effective, low-threshold intervention programs to promote adolescents' daily functioning and well-being and prevent the emergence of mental health problems that negatively affect school performance.Trial Registration: Dutch Trial Register number NL7438 .

        <ab>BackgroundDepression in schizophrenia predicts poor outcomes, including suicide, yet the effectiveness of antidepressants for its treatment remains uncertain.AimsTo synthesise the evidence of the effectiveness of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in schizophrenia.MethodMultiple databases were searched and inclusion criteria included participants aged over 18 years with schizophrenia or related psychosis with a depressive episode. Papers were quality assessed used the Cochrane risk bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed for risk difference and standardised mean difference of all antidepressants, antidepressant class and individual antidepressant where sufficient studies allowed.ResultsA total of 26 moderate- to low-quality trials met inclusion criteria. In meta-analysis a significant risk difference was found in favour of antidepressant treatment, with a number needed to treat of 5 (95% CI 4-9). Studies using tools specifically designed to assess depression in schizophrenia showed a larger effect size. However, after sensitivity analysis standardised mean difference of all antidepressants did not show a statistically significant improvement in depression score at end-point, neither did any individual antidepressant class.ConclusionsAntidepressants may be effective for the treatment of depression in schizophrenia, however, the evidence is mixed and conclusions must be qualified by the small number of low- or moderate-quality studies. Further sufficiently powered, high-quality studies are needed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and subsequent possible adverse effects on the cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of the child. The aim of the study was to identify maternal characteristics associated with poor mental health, in a group of overweight/obese pregnant women in nine European countries, and thus, to contribute to better recognition and intervention for maternal depression.Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, baseline data from early pregnancy (&lt; 20 weeks) of the DALI (Vitamin D and Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention) study were analyzed. Maternal mental health was assessed with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Women were classified as having a low (WHO-5 ≤ 50) or high wellbeing.Results: A total of 735 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of having a low wellbeing was 27.2%, 95% CI [24.0, 30.4]. Multivariate analysis showed independent associations between low wellbeing and European ethnicity, OR = .44, 95% CI [.25, .77], shift work, OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93], insufficient sleep, OR = 3.30, 95% CI [1.96, 5.55], self-efficacy, OR = .95, 95% CI [.92, .98], social support, OR = .94, 95% CI [.90, .99], and pregnancy-related worries (socioeconomic: OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.15]; health: OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.11]; relationship: OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.05, 1.31]).Conclusions: Mental health problems are common in European overweight/obese pregnant women. The identified correlates might help in early recognition and subsequent treatment of poor mental health problems during pregnancy. This is important to reduce the unfavorable effects of poor mental health on pregnancy outcomes.Trial Registration: ISRCTN70595832 , 02.12.2011.</ab>

        <ab>Background: It has been shown that chronic stress-induced depression is associated with exaggerated inflammatory response in the brain. Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) regulate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, but the role of cholinergic signaling and α7nAChR in chronic stress has not yet been examined.Methods: In this study, we used a well-documented model of depression in which mice were exposed to 6 h of restraint stress for 21 consecutive days. Components of cholinergic signaling and TLR4 signaling were analyzed in the hippocampus. The main targets of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage were also evaluated after a series of tests for depression-like behavior.Results: Chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced alterations in components of central cholinergic signaling in hippocampus, including increases in choline acetyltransferase protein expression and decreases in nuclear STAT3 signaling. CRS also increased TLR4 signaling activity, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α expression, microglial activation, and neuronal morphologic changes. Cholinergic stimulation with the α7nAChR agonist DMXBA significantly alleviated CRS-induced depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammation, and neuronal damage, but these effects were abolished by the selective α7nAChR antagonist α-bungarotoxin. Furthermore, activation of α7nAChRs restored the central cholinergic signaling function, inhibited TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling and microglial activity, and increased the number of regulatory T cells in the hippocampus.Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that α7nAChR activation mitigates CRS-induced neuroinflammation and cell death, suggesting that α7nAChRs could be a new therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of depression.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Chronic pain has major clinical and social consequences. Few studies have examined any variation in the extent of impairment on quality of life and work productivity by site and type of chronic pain.Objective: The objective of our study is to examine adverse impacts of chronic pain on physical and psychological health and work productivity.Methods: Our community-population study was based on a phone-interview of adults with chronic pain, residing in Olmsted County, MN. Chronic pain groups were categorized into abdominal pain, back pain, joint pain, multisite pain, neuropathic pain or no chronic pain. We used standardized instruments, including the Brief Pain Inventory, the Patients Health Questionnair-9, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire.Results: We evaluated 591 patients suffering from chronic pain and 150 participants with no chronic pain. Almost one third of patients with multisite pain (33%) and neuropathic pain (32%) reported mild/major depressive symptoms. Patients suffering from chronic pain, particularly from multisite pain and neuropathic pain, reported significant pain interferences with daily activities and impairments in physical function. Chronic pain was significantly associated with reduced performance at work but not with missed work hours. The average reported reduction in work productivity ranged from 2.4 hours (±5.6) per week for adults with joint chronic pain to 9.8 hours (±11.1) per week for adults with multisite chronic pain.Conclusions: Chronic pain, particularly multisite pain and neuropathic pain, significantly affected physical and psychological health. Chronic pain is a multifaceted health condition that requires a multidisciplinary treatment approach.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Depressive and anxiety disorders are frequent among people with epilepsies. There are, however, only few longitudinal studies, which examine the relationship between these comorbid psychiatric disorders and epilepsy-related variables. Thus, we investigated the interrelationships of depression and anxiety symptoms with seizure frequency across time.Methods: Before admittance to an epilepsy center (T1) and six months after discharge (T2), patients (n=198) with mainly difficult-to-treat epilepsies completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Correlation and path analyses were conducted.Results: Depression and anxiety symptoms (HADS) as well as seizure frequency significantly decreased from baseline to follow-up. Both at T1 and T2, seizure frequency was slightly, but significantly correlated with depression and anxiety levels (rs=0.17-.32). Cross-lagged-analyses showed that baseline (T1) level of depression significantly predicted frequency of seizures at follow-up (T2). However, anxiety at T1 was not a significant predictor of seizure frequency at T2 and seizure frequency at T1 did not predict either depressive or anxiety symptoms at T2.Conclusion: The present findings emphasize the importance of psychiatric comorbidities, especially depression, for seizure frequency and its progress in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies referred to a specialized epilepsy center. Thus, comorbid psychiatric disorders need specific consideration as part of a comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic treatment approach.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: to investigate potential factors impacting HRQOL among PWE at a medical facility in the UAE.Methods: Depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life were assessed in 160 adult patients with epilepsy from September 2014 to January 2015 at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC). The World Health Organization Quality of Life abbreviated scale (WHOQOL-BREF), the Patient Health Questionnaire nine-item (PHQ-9) depression scale, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item (GAD-7) scale were administered. Demographic details including psychosocial factors were also obtained. Clinical details including seizure freedom, epilepsy type, epilepsy duration, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were recorded. Multivariate analysis was used to look at significant variables associated with HRQOL.Results: Depression, anxiety, seizure freedom, and the use of anti-depressants had significant positive correlation with HRQOL in univariate analysis. However, depression, followed by seizure freedom, had the strongest association with HRQOL in a multivariate regression analysis.Conclusion: Depression and seizure freedom, followed by anxiety and anti-depressants use, were significantly correlated with HRQOL. These results underscore the importance of screening for psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy.Implications: Screening for comorbid psychiatric disorders should be an essential component of the standard of care, and incorporated in the treatment plan for all patients with epilepsy. Factors contributing to psychiatric symptoms among PWE, such as maladaptive illness perceptions, non-adherence to anti-epileptic drugs (AED), and social stigma should be carefully addressed to achieve an optimal health-care plan.</ab>

        <ab>To serve a wider range of patients with serious mental illness and develop more integrated, flexible services, investigators in Toronto redesigned a high-fidelity assertive community treatment (ACT) team according to flexible ACT (FACT) principles. FACT, developed in the Netherlands, merges ACT and intensive case management (ICM) services. This model holds the promise of an affordable approach to addressing unmet service needs in community mental health, particularly for patients with complex health issues, by widening the ACT admission criteria. This enables the team to serve more patients and provide both ACT and ICM services according to patients' needs while allowing continuity of care.</ab>

        <ab>Rapid growth and development in recent decades has seen mental health and mental illness emerge as priority health concerns for the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). As a result, mental health services in the region are being redefined and expanded. However, there is a paucity of local research to guide ongoing service development. Local research is important because service users' experience of mental illness and mental health services are linked to their sociocultural context. In order for service development to be most effective, there is a need for increased understanding of the people who use these services.This article aims to review and synthesize mental health research from the Gulf Cooperation Council. It also seeks to identify gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research. A scoping framework was used to conduct this review. To identify studies, database searches were undertaken, regional journals were hand-searched, and reference lists of included articles were examined. Empirical studies undertaken in the Gulf Cooperation Council that reported mental health service users' experience of mental illness were included. Framework analysis was used to synthesize results. Fifty-five studies met inclusion criteria and the following themes were identified: service preferences, illness (symptomology, perceived cause, impact), and recovery (traditional healing, family support, religion). Gaps included contradictory findings related to the supportive role of the Arabic extended family and religion, under-representation of women in study samples, and limited attention on illness management outside of the hospital setting.From this review, it is clear that the sociocultural context in the region is linked to service users' experience of mental illness. Future research that aims to fill the identified gaps and develop and test culturally appropriate interventions will aid practice and policy development in the region.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined postrelease patterns of Medicaid coverage and use of services among persons with severe mental illness who were referred for expedited Medicaid enrollment before their release from state prisons, county jails, and psychiatric hospitals in Washington State during 2006, the first year of a new policy authorizing this practice.Methods: A retrospective cohort design was used with linked administrative data to identify persons with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) who were referred for expedited Medicaid enrollment from state prisons (N=252), county jails (N=489), and psychiatric hospitals (N=507). For each cohort, logistic regression was used to compare those who were approved for expedited Medicaid with those who were not approved; for the 30-, 60-, and 90-day periods after release, Medicaid enrollment status and use of outpatient mental health services were also compared.Results: Approval rates were higher for persons released from psychiatric hospitals (91%) and state prisons (83%) than for those released from jails (66%) (p&lt;.001). Across settings, approval was more likely for those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and for women (p&lt;.001), as well as for whites and older offenders (p&lt;.01). At the 90-day follow-up, those who were approved were more likely than those who were denied to be enrolled in Medicaid (p&lt;.001) and to have used outpatient mental health services (p&lt;.001).Conclusions: Expediting Medicaid benefits for persons with severe mental illness was associated with increased enrollment and outpatient mental health service use in the 90 days after release from state prisons, county jails, and psychiatric hospitals in Washington State.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The goal of these analyses was to describe the 12-month prevalence of mental health services retention for youths ages six to 12 years and identify predictors of treatment retention. Data were from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms study.Methods: In a longitudinal cohort study, 416 children and their parents completed measures of mental health services use and parents' perception of the services and participated in semistructured psychodiagnostic interviews during a baseline and 12-month assessment. Logistic regression analyses examined the effects on 12-month treatment retention of demographic and clinical variables and parents' perception of how well their children's treatment matched their needs.Results: Sixty-nine percent of youths (N=289) continued to use services at 12 months. After the analyses controlled for other demographic and clinical factors, white race (p&lt;.001) and greater functional impairment (p=.024) were associated with treatment retention; greater perceived treatment match at baseline significantly predicted retention above and beyond the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables (p=.001).Conclusions: Parents' perceptions about appropriateness of treatment, white race, and functional impairment predicted 12-month treatment retention.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Severe mental illness (SMI) is common, chronic and difficult to treat. Sleep and circadian dysfunctions are prominent correlates of SMI, yet have been minimally studied in ways that reflect the complexity of the sleep problems experienced. Prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused-they have treated a specific sleep problem in a specific diagnostic group. However, real life sleep and circadianproblems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in SMI where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Accordingly, the aim of this studyprotocol is to test the hypothesis that a Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) will improve functional impairment, disorder-focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. Participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems are eligible. The elements of TranS-C are efficacious across SMI in research settings with research-based providers. The next step is to test TranS-C in a community setting. Accordingly, this study is being conducted within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS), the Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) for Alameda County.Methods/design: 120 adults diagnosed with SMI and sleep and circadian dysfunction within ACBHCS will be randomly allocated to TranS-C (n = 60) or 6-months of Usual Care followed by Delayed Treatment with TranS-C (UC-DT; n = 60). TranS-C is modularized and delivered across eight to twelve 50-minute, weekly, individual sessions. All participants will be assessed before and immediately following treatment and again 6 months later. Primary analysis will examine whether TranS-C significantly improves functional impairment, disorder-specific symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning, relative to UC-DT. Exploratory analysis will examine whether improvements in sleep and circadian functioning predict reduction in functional impairment and disorder-specific symptoms, and whether the intervention effects are mediated by improved sleep and circadian functioning and moderated by previously reported risk factors (demographics, symptom severity, medications, psychiatric and medical comorbidity).Discussion: This trial tests an important and understudied mechanism-dysregulated sleep and circadian rhythms-in SMI, a novel transdiagnostic treatment approach, in a community setting so as to contribute to the goal of bridging the gap between research and practice.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02469233 .

        <ab>Background: Evidence suggests that current treatments cannot fully alleviate the burden of disease associated with depression but that prevention approaches offer a promising opportunity to further reduce this burden. Adolescence is a critical period in the development of mental illness, and final school examinations are a significant and nearly universal stressor that may act as a trigger for mental health difficulties such as depression. The aim of the present trial is to investigate the impact of SPARX-R, an online, gamified intervention based on cognitive behavioural principles, on the prevention of depression in secondary school students before their final examinations.Methods/design: Government, independent and Catholic secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to participate in the trial. All students enrolled in their final year of high school (year 12) in participating schools will be invited to participate. To account for possible attrition, the target sample size was set at 1600 participants across 30 schools. Participating schools will be cluster randomised at the school level to receive either SPARX-R or lifeSTYLE, an attention-controlled placebo comparator. The control intervention is an online program aimed at maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes will include symptoms of anxiety, suicidal ideation and behaviours, stigma and academic performance. Additional measures of cost-effectiveness, as well as process variables (e.g., adherence, acceptability) and potential predictors of response to treatment, will be collected. Consenting parents will be invited to complete measures regarding their own mental health and expectations for their child. Assessments will be conducted pre- and post-intervention and at 6- and 18-month follow-up. Primary analyses will compare changes in levels of depressive symptomatology for the intervention group relative to the attention control condition using mixed-effects model repeated-measures analyses to account for clustering within schools.Discussion: This is the first trial of a universal depression prevention intervention delivered to school students in advance of a specific, significant stressor. If found to be effective, this program may offer schools a new approach to preparing students for their final year of schooling.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier: ACTRN12614000316606 .

        <ab>Objective: The objective of this study was to characterize racial-ethnic variation in diagnoses and treatment of mental disorders in large not-for-profit health care systems.Methods: Participating systems were 11 private, not-for-profit health care organizations constituting the Mental Health Research Network, with a combined 7,523,956 patients age 18 or older who received care during 2011. Rates of diagnoses, prescription of psychotropic medications, and total formal psychotherapy sessions received were obtained from insurance claims and electronic medical record databases across all health care settings.Results: Of the 7.5 million patients in the study, 1.2 million (15.6%) received a psychiatric diagnosis in 2011. This varied significantly by race-ethnicity, with Native American/Alaskan Native patients having the highest rates of any diagnosis (20.6%) and Asians having the lowest rates (7.5%). Among patients with a psychiatric diagnosis, 73% (N=850,585) received a psychotropic medication. Non-Hispanic white patients were significantly more likely (77.8%) than other racial-ethnic groups (odds ratio [OR] range .48-.81) to receive medication. In contrast, only 34% of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis (N=548,837) received formal psychotherapy. Racial-ethnic differences were most pronounced for depression and schizophrenia; compared with whites, non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to receive formal psychotherapy for their depression (OR=1.20) or for their schizophrenia (OR=2.64).Conclusions: There were significant racial-ethnic differences in diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions across 11 U.S. health care systems. Further study is needed to understand underlying causes of these observed differences and whether processes and outcomes of care are equitable across these diverse patient populations.</ab>

        <ab>Study Question: Is expressive writing intervention (EWI) efficacious in reducing distress and improving pregnancy rates for couples going through ART treatment?Summary Answer: Compared to controls, EWI statistically significantly reduced depressive symptoms but not anxiety and infertility-related distress.What Is Known Already: ART treatment is considered stressful. So far, various psychological interventions have been tested for their potential in reducing infertility-related distress and the results are generally positive. It remains unclear whether EWI, a brief and potentially cost-effective intervention, could be advantageous.Study Design Size, Duration: Between November 2010 and July 2012, a total of 295 participants (163 women, 132 men) were randomly allocated to EWI or a neutral writing control group.Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: Participants were couples undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment. Single women and couples with Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis or acute change of procedure from insemination to IVF, were excluded. EWI participants participated in three 20-min home-based writing exercises focusing on emotional disclosure in relation to infertility/fertility treatment (two sessions) and benefit finding (one session). Controls wrote non-emotionally in three 20-min sessions about their daily activities. The participants completed questionnaires at the beginning of treatment (t1), prior to the pregnancy test (t2), and 3 months later (t3). In total, 26.8% (79/295) were lost to follow-up. Mixed linear models were chosen to compare the two groups over time for psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety and infertility-related distress), and a Chi2 test was employed in order to examine group differences in pregnancy rates MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: One hundred and fifty-three participants received EWI (women = 83; men = 70) and 142 participants were allocated to the neutral writing control group (women = 83; men = 62). Both women and partners in the EWI group exhibited greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared with controls (P = 0.049; [CI 95%: -0.04; -0.01] Cohen's d = 0.27). The effect of EWI on anxiety did not reach statistical significance. Overall infertility-related distress increased marginally for the partners in the EWI group compared to the partners in the control group (P = 0.06; Cohen's d = 0.17). However, in relation to the personal subdomain, the increase was statistically significant (P = 0.01; Cohen's d = 0.24). EWI had no statistically significant effect on pregnancy rates with 42/83 (50.6%) achieving pregnancy in the EWI group compared with 40/80 (49.4%) in the control group (RR = 0.99 [CI 95% = 0.725, 1.341]; P = 0.94).Limitations, Reasons For Caution: The results for depressive symptoms corresponded to a small effect size and the remaining results failed to reach statistical significance. This could be due to sample characteristics leading to a possible floor-effect, as we did not exclude participants with low levels of emotional distress at baseline. Furthermore, men showed increased infertility-related distress over time.Wider Implications Of the Findings: EWI is a potentially cost-effective and easy to implement home-based intervention, and even small effects may be relevant. When faced with infertility, EWI could thus be a relevant tool for alleviating depressive symptoms by allowing the expression of feelings about infertility that may be perceived as socially unacceptable. However, the implications do not seem to be applicable for men, who presented with increased infertility-related distress over time.Study Funding/competing Interests: The present study was supported by research grants from Merck Sharpe and Dohme and The Danish Agency for Science Technology and Innovation as part of a publicly funded PhD. The funding bodies had no influence on the data collection, analysis or conclusions of the study. None of the authors have any conflicts of interest to declare.Trial Registration Number: Clinicaltrials.gov, trial no.

        <ab>Background: Long-term conditions often coexist with depression and anxiety.Aims: To assess the effectiveness of stepped-care psychological therapies for patients with long-term conditions.Method: Data from 28 498 patients were analysed using regression to model depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7)) outcomes. Post-treatment symptoms and effect sizes (d) were estimated for individuals with and without long-term conditions, controlling for covariates. The likelihood of access and response to intensive psychological interventions was also examined.Results: Higher post-treatment symptoms were predicted for patients with musculoskeletal problems (d = 0.22-0.27), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (d = 0.26-0.33), diabetes (d = 0.05-0.13) and psychotic disorders (d = 0.50-0.58). Most long-term conditions were associated with greater odds of accessing high-intensity therapies, yet individuals who accessed these continued to have higher average post-treatment symptoms.Conclusions: Some long-term conditions are associated with greater intensity of care and poorer outcomes after therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Background: With technological developments and modernised sedentary lifestyles has come an increase in diseases associated with inactivity such as obesity and other non-communicable diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that time spent sedentary may also interact with mental health. This systematic review examined the associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health problems among adolescents. Methods: This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, and applied a quality assessment tool for quantitative studies to identity best available evidence. Following stringent search strategy of the databases; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Health Source: Nursing and Academic Edition, MEDLINE, PsychARTICLES and PsycINFO, we identified 32 articles eligible for review. Results: All studies reported leisure screen time among adolescents, and two thirds of identified studies examined depressive symptomatology. Other mental health measures were; anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, suicide ideation, loneliness, stress, and psychological distress. Strong consistent evidence was found for the relationship between both depressive symptomatology and psychological distress, and time spent using screens for leisure. Moderate evidence supported the relationship between low self-esteem and screen use. Poorer mental health status was found among adolescents using screen time more than 2-3 h per day, and gender differences exist. Essential information was missing for quality of evidence including heterogeneity in mental health and screen time-based measures, and self-report data collection methods. Conclusions: The findings are of particular significance given the global public health concern of lifestyle-attributed diseases and the possibility for novel approaches to mental health. Future research should examine the psychological impact of reducing time spent using screens for leisure among adolescents, whilst accounting for possible confounding factors such as physical activity and dietary behaviours. It is critical that the reciprocal relationship between lifestyle behaviours and mental health is represented in both the psychiatric and public health forum.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This research aimed to characterize HIV testing rates among Medicaid recipients with severe mental illness who received public specialty mental health services.Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined California Medicaid records from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2011 (N=56,895). Study participants were between age 18 and 67, utilized specialty mental health care services, were prescribed antipsychotic medications, and were not dually eligible for Medicare. Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to estimate the overall effects of predictor variables on HIV testing prevalence.Results: During the study period, 6.7% of people with severe mental illness received HIV testing. Men were 32% less likely to be tested for HIV than women (p&lt;.001). Compared with whites, Asians/Pacific Islanders were 53% less likely and blacks were 82% more likely to be tested (p&lt;.001). Those with comorbid drug or alcohol use disorders were more likely to be tested than those without such disorders (p&lt;.001). Utilization of nonpsychiatric medical care was the strongest predictor of HIV testing (p&lt;.001).Conclusions: Most adults with severe mental illness receiving public specialty mental health services were not tested for HIV during a one-year period. Public health administrators must prioritize HIV testing for early identification of HIV infection and prevention of HIV transmission.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Anxiety and depression are major health concerns in general among older adults and especially during hospitalization, as they lead to numerous negative outcomes. There is currently no sufficient body of research examining the role of cultural background in patients' experience of these conditions. Better identifying patients at risk may help reduce inequity and provide patient-centered, culturally sensitive care. The current study explores the roles of culture and acculturation in anxiety and depression levels in recent and veteran Russian immigrants compared with native Israelis and veteran immigrants from Middle Eastern countries. Methods: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of cognitively intact older adults (70+) hospitalized for acute conditions in internal medical units in two hospitals in Israel during 2009-11. Depression and anxiety were assessed within 48 h of admission through personal interview using the Tucker Depression Rating and the Short Anxiety Screening Tests. Demographic and health data were collected from electronic health records. Immigration status was defined by country and emigration year. Study hypotheses were tested employing analyses of covariance, modeling anxiety and depression symptoms separately, controlling for potential confounders. Results: Significant differences between study groups were observed in fully adjusted models for anxiety symptoms (F[3, 515] =5.24, p &lt; .01) when both veteran (21 ± 5.83) and recent (20.2 ± 5.23) Russian immigrants expressed higher anxiety levels than native Israelis (18.35 ± 5.23) and veteran immigrants (18 ± 5.03) (from p = .05 to p &lt;0.01).No significant differences were found in anxiety symptoms between recent and veteran Russian immigrants. Both depression and anxiety symptoms showed an interaction effect of study immigration groups by sex: while no differences were observed among native Israelis, significantly higher depression and anxiety were observed among women than men in the other groups. Conclusions: Culture of origin may play a central role in determining expression of anxiety symptoms and perhaps modify acculturation. During hospitalization, special attention should be given to the level of anxiety among not only recent but also veteran immigrants. Further research may explore whether elevated anxiety is a result of stress due to hospitalization or a stable trait.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Studies examining psychosocial and depression assessment programs in maternity settings have not adequately considered the context in which psychosocial assessment occurs or how broader components of integrated care, including clinician decision-making aids, may optimise program delivery and its cost-effectiveness. There is also limited evidence relating to the diagnostic accuracy of symptom-based screening measures used in this context. The Perinatal Integrated Psychosocial Assessment (PIPA) Project was developed to address these knowledge gaps. The primary aims of the PIPA Project are to examine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of two alternative models of integrated psychosocial care during pregnancy: 'care as usual' (the SAFE START model) and an alternative model (the PIPA model). The acceptability and perceived benefit of each model of care from the perspective of both pregnant women and their healthcare providers will also be assessed. Our secondary aim is to examine the psychometric properties of a number of symptom-based screening tools for depression and anxiety when used in pregnancy.Methods: This is a comparative-effectiveness study comparing 'care as usual' to an alternative model sequentially over two 12-month periods. Data will be collected from women at Time 1 (initial antenatal psychosocial assessment), Time 2 (2-weeks after Time 1) and from clinicians at Time 3 for each condition. Primary aims will be evaluated using a between-groups design, and the secondary aim using a within group design.Discussion: The PIPA Project will provide evidence relating to the clinical- and cost- effectiveness of psychosocial assessment integrated with electronic clinician decision making prompts, and referral options that are tailored to the woman's psychosocial risk, in the maternity care setting. It will also address research recommendations from the Australian (2011) and NICE (2015) Clinical Practice Guidelines.Trial Registration: ACTRN12617000932369.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Internet addiction (IA) is a common problem found in young Asians. This study aimed to study the influence of IA and online activities on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in young Vietnamese. This study also compared the frequencies of anxiety, depression and other addiction of young Vietnamese with and without IA.Methods: This study recruited 566 young Vietnamese (56.7% female, 43.3% male) ranging from 15 to 25 years of age via the respondent-driven sampling technique. Chi-squared, t-test and analysis of variance were used to compare young Vietnamese with and without IA. Regression analyses were used to examine the association between internet usage characteristics and HRQOL.Results: Results from this cross-sectional study showed that 21.2% of participants suffered from IA. Online relationship demonstrated significantly higher influences on behaviors and lifestyles in participants with IA than those without IA. Participants with IA were more likely to have problems with self-care, difficulty in performing daily routine, suffer from pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression. Contrary to previous studies, we found that there were no differences in gender, sociodemographic, the number of participants with cigarette smoking, water-pipe smoking and alcohol dependence between the IA and non-IA groups. IA was significantly associated with poor HRQOL in young Vietnamese.Conclusion: IA is a common problem among young Vietnamese and the prevalence of IA is the highest as compared to other Asian countries. Our findings suggest that gender may not play a key role in IA. This can be an emerging trend when both genders have equal access to the internet. By studying the impact of IA on HRQOL, healthcare professionals can design effective intervention to alleviate the negative consequences of IA in Vietnam.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundDespite the evidence base for computer-assisted cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in the general population, it has not yet been adapted for use with adults who have an intellectual disability.AimsTo evaluate the utility of a CBT computer game for adults who have an intellectual disability.MethodA 2 × 3 (group × time) randomised controlled trial design was used. Fifty-two adults with mild to moderate intellectual disability and anxiety or depression were randomly allocated to two groups: computerised CBT (cCBT) or psychiatric treatment as usual (TAU), and assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Forty-nine participants were included in the final analysis.ResultsA significant group × time interaction was observed on the primary outcome measure of anxiety (Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with an Intellectual Disability), favouring cCBT over TAU, but not on the primary outcome measure of depression (Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability). A medium effect size for anxiety symptoms was observed at post-treatment and a large effect size was observed after follow-up. Reliability of Change Indices indicated that the intervention produced clinically significant change in the cCBT group in comparison with TAU.ConclusionsAs the first application of cCBT for adults with intellectual disability, this intervention appears to be a useful treatment option to reduce anxiety symptoms in this population.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Stress, regardless of its nature is nowadays recognized as one of the major risk factors for neuropsychiatric diseases, such as mood and anxiety disorders. The brain compared with other organs is more vulnerable to oxidative damage mainly due to its high rate of oxygen consumption, abundant lipid content, and relative insufficiency of antioxidant enzymes. Thus, the identification of neural mechanisms underlying resistance and vulnerability to stress is of crucial importance in understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and in developing new treatments, since the existing ones are for several reasons subject to increasing limitations. This study was aimed to assess the effects of hydromethanolic extract of Ficus sycomorus stem bark on depression, anxiety and memory impairment induced by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) in rats. Methods: These effects were studied using anxiety-related behavior, depression-related behavior, anhedonia-like behavior and the Y maze task. Sucrose test was performed twice (before and after UCMS) to assess anhedonia in rats. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the extract were performed. The antioxidant activities of the extract were assessed using total glutathione (GSH) content and malondialdehyde (MDA) level (lipid peroxidation) in the rat temporal lobe homogenates. Results: The extract of F. sycomorus in a dose of 100 mg/kg significantly increased the sucrose consumption and the swimming time which had been reduced by the unpredictable chronic mild stress (p &lt; 0.001). The extract also significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01) the latency time in the novelty-suppressed feeding test. In the elevated plus-maze, the extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01) the time and the number of entries into the closed arms. The treatment with the extracts also significantly increased alternation in the Y-maze (p &lt; 0.01 for 100 mg/kg). The extract significantly increased the total GSH content and reduced MDA level in rat temporal lobe. For the LC-MS analysis, the major compound in the extract was a flavonoid with formula C22H28O14. Conclusions: F. sycomorus reversed the harmful effects of UCMS on mood and behaviors in rats and it possesses an antidepressant property that is at least in part mediated through the oxidative pathway.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Memory Support Intervention was developed in response to evidence showing that: (1) patient memory for treatment is poor, (2) poor memory for treatment is associated with poorer adherence and poorer outcome, (3) the impact of memory impairment can be minimized by the use of memory support strategies and (4) improved memory for treatment improves outcome. The aim of this study protocol is to conduct a confirmatory efficacy trial to test whether the Memory Support Intervention improves illness course and functional outcomes. As a "platform" for the next step in investigating this approach, we focus on major depressive disorder (MDD) and cognitive therapy (CT).Method/design: Adults with MDD (n = 178, including 20% for potential attrition) will be randomly allocated to CT + Memory Support or CT-as-usual and will be assessed at baseline, post treatment and at 6 and 12 months' follow-up (6FU and 12FU). We will compare the effects of CT + Memory Support vs. CT-as-usual to determine if the new intervention improves the course of illness and reduces functional impairment (aim 1). We will determine if patient memory for treatment mediates the relationship between treatment condition and outcome (aim 2). We will evaluate if previously reported poor treatment response subgroups moderate target engagement (aim 3).Discussion: The Memory Support Intervention has been developed to be "transdiagnostic" (relevant to a broad range of mental disorders) and "pantreatment" (relevant to a broad range of types of treatment). This study protocol describes a "next step" in the treatment development process by testing the Memory Support Intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD) and cognitive therapy (CT). If the results are promising, future directions will test the applicability to other kinds of interventions and disorders and in other settings.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT01790919 .

        <ab>Objective: This study evaluated whether eight quality measures assessing care for patients with a substance use disorder were associated with patient perceptions of their care, including perceived improvement and global rating of behavioral health care.Methods: Secondary data analyses were conducted of administrative and patient survey data collected as part of a national evaluation of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mental health and substance use services. Data for patients who received care for substance use disorders during October 2006-September 2007 paid for by the VHA and who participated in a telephone interview about their care (N=2,074) were included. Measures of patient perceptions of care included perceived improvement and global rating of behavioral health care. Eight quality measures based on administrative data assessed initiation and engagement in substance use disorder care, receipt of psychotherapy or psychosocial treatment, and follow-up after hospitalization. Regression models were conducted in which each quality measure predicted each outcome, with analyses adjusting for patient characteristics and functioning.Results: Treatment engagement, two measures of psychotherapy receipt, and psychosocial treatment were significantly associated with perceived improvement, whereas treatment initiation and follow-up after hospitalization (seven and 30 days) were not. Psychotherapy receipt and follow-up after hospitalization (seven and 30 days) were significantly associated with global rating of behavioral health care.Conclusions: Some quality measures assessing care for substance use disorders were significantly associated with patient perceptions of care. Results provide additional support for these quality measures and suggest that patient perceptions of care are an important outcome in assessing care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: So-ochim-tang-gamibang (SOCG) is a decoction formula which has been used to improve mental activity in traditional Korean medicine. The present study was performed to evaluate whether the treatment of SOCG was involved in activating hippocampal neurons in mice which were subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS). Methods: Mice were subjected to CRS for 2 weeks to induce depressive-like behaviors. SOCG was orally administered for the same period. mRNA expression in the hippocampus was analyzed by RT-PCR. Levels of serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR in the hippocampus were determined by western blotting and by immunofluorescence staining in coronal brain sections. Cultured neurons were prepared from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mice to examine the effects of CRS and SOCG treatment on neurite outgrowth. Depressive-like behaviors of experimental animals were measured by open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST). Results: mRNA levels of serotonin 1A and 1B receptors (5-HT1AR and 5-HT1BR) were decreased in the hippocampus of CRS animals and increased by SOCG treatment. Signals of 5-HT1AR protein in CA3 pyramidal cells were decreased by CRS but elevated back to levels in control animals after SOCG treatment. Phospho-Erk1/2 protein in CA3 cells showed similar pattern of changes as in 5-HT1AR, suggesting coordinated regulation after SOCG treatment in CRS animals. Axonal growth-associated protein GAP-43 levels were also decreased by CRS and then increased by SOCG treatment. In vivo administration of SOCG improved neurite outgrowth of primary DRG neurons from CRS animals and also increased 5-HT1AR protein signals. Behavioral tests of open field and forced swimming showed that immobility time periods were significantly decreased by SOCG treatment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that SOCG treatment may increase synaptic responsiveness to serotonergic neuronal inputs by upregulating 5-HT1AR in the hippocampal neurons.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Care for people with serious mental illness and diabetes is complicated by clinical heterogeneity. This cross-sectional analysis of 200 individuals with comorbid serious mental illness and diabetes explored differentiation between patient subgroups that were characterized on the basis of selected dimensions within a biopsychosocial framework.Methods: Relationships between self-efficacy, treatment expectation, social support, and depression were first assessed via bivariate Spearman correlations among 200 individuals participating in a randomized controlled trial who had diabetes along with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Next, latent profile analyses were conducted to determine underlying subgroups on the basis of these variables. The resultant groups were compared on diabetes control, function, and symptoms.Results: Two subgroups emerged. One had more severe psychiatric symptoms, low scores on other psychosocial variables, and worse diabetes control. The other had low levels of psychiatric symptoms, better scores on other variables, and better diabetes control.Conclusions: Symptom presentation and internal and external resources appeared to be related to diabetes control for people with comorbid diabetes and serious mental illness. Care approaches need to go beyond standard education and consider biopsychosocial variables.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Adults with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (CODs) are overrepresented in jails. In-custody barriers to treatment, including a lack of evidence-based treatment options and the often short periods of incarceration, and limited communication between jails and community-based treatment agencies that can hinder immediate enrollment into community care once released have contributed to a cycle of limited treatment engagement, unaddressed criminogenic risks, and (re)arrest among this vulnerable and high-risk population. This paper describes a study that will develop research and communication protocols and adapt two evidence-based treatments, dual-diagnosis motivational interviewing (DDMI) and integrated group therapy (IGT), for delivery to adults with CODs across a jail-to-community treatment continuum.Methods/design: Adaptations to DDMI and IGT were guided by the Risk-Need-Responsivity model and the National Institute of Corrections' implementation competencies; the development of the implementation framework and communication protocols were guided by the Evidence-Based Interagency Implementation Model for community corrections and the Inter-organizational Relationship model, respectively. Implementation and evaluation of the protocols and adapted interventions will occur via an open trial and a pilot randomized trial. The clinical intervention consists of two in-jail DDMI sessions and 12 in-community IGT sessions. Twelve adults with CODs and four clinicians will participate in the open trial to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of, and fidelity to, the interventions and research and communication protocols. The pilot controlled trial will be conducted with 60 inmates who will be randomized to either DDMI-IGT or treatment as usual. A baseline assessment will be conducted in jail, and four community-based assessments will be conducted during a 6-month follow-up period. Implementation, clinical, public health, and treatment preference outcomes will be evaluated.Discussion: Findings have the potential to improve both jail- and community-based treatment services for adults with CODs as well as inform methods for conducting rigorous pilot implementation and evaluation research in correctional settings and as inmates re-enter the community. Findings will contribute to a growing area of work focused on interrupting the cycle of limited treatment engagement, unaddressed criminogenic risks, and (re)arrest among adults with CODs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02214667 .

        <ab>Background: Effects of return to work (RTW) interventions vary, and more knowledge is needed about the factors that contribute to RTW. This study investigated changes in work participation and mental health, and predictors of RTW among patients being treated for common mental disorders (CMDs).Methods: The study was a prospective pre-post study of 164 patients treated at an RTW outpatient clinic for CMDs. Differences between before and after treatment were analysed using paired t tests for continuous variables and marginal homogeneity test for categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with RTW. Baseline data (patient characteristics, clinical status, generalized self-efficacy, expectations of future work ability) and treatment variables were used as independent variables in logistic regressions. Further analysis investigated whether improvements in symptoms, work ability, expectations of future work ability and generalized self-efficacy were associated with RTW.Results: Number of individuals with full work participation increased, and there were improvements in symptoms, work ability and generalized self-efficacy. In the final model for predicting RTW, baseline work ability and expectancy of future work ability, a history of psychiatric treatment and focus on RTW in the treatment predicted RTW. Improvement in expectations of future work ability at post-treatment did also predict RTW.Conclusions: Assessing work ability and expectations of RTW at the beginning of treatment is recommended to identify patients at risk of long-term sick leave. Individuals with a history of psychiatric treatment are also risking long-term work disability. It is essential that treatment focus not only on symptom-relief, but also on improving work ability and expectations of RTW. An RTW-focused approach in therapy is associated with RTW.Trail Registration: ClinicalTrails.gov ID NCT01181635 . Registered 08/12/2010.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: To examine the independent contribution of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to changes in body composition in older adolescents. METHODS: Medically healthy 15- to 20-year-olds who were unmedicated or within 1 month of starting an SSRI were prospectively followed. Psychiatric functioning and medication treatment were assessed monthly. Body Mass Index (BMI) was measured every 4 months. Every 8 months, a whole-body dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry scan was obtained to determine lean BMI, fat mass index, and visceral fat mass. Linear mixed effects regression analysis examined associations between MDD, GAD, and SSRI use variables and body composition measures. RESULTS: Over 1.51 ± 0.76 years of follow-up, 264 participants contributed 805 observations. After adjusting for age, sex, physical activity, dietary intake, and time in the study, MDD severity was inversely associated, prospectively, with BMI, fat mass index, and lean BMI z scores, whereas cumulative SSRI treatment duration and dose were positively associated with these outcomes. GAD severity and diagnosis were not significantly associated with any body composition outcome. Moreover, citalopram and escitalopram were most strongly associated with the increase in all body composition measures, including visceral fat mass, whereas the associations with fluoxetine were somewhat weaker. Sertraline was not different from no SSRI treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Depression severity was associated with a decrease in measures of body composition in older adolescents over a mean of 1.5 years, whereas SSRI treatment was positively associated with these outcomes, with differential effects across treatment groups.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) provide a legal mechanism for competent adults to document care preferences and authorize a surrogate to make treatment decisions. In a controlled research setting, an evidence-based intervention, the facilitated psychiatric advance directive (FPAD), was previously shown to overcome most barriers to PAD completion. This study examined implementation of the FPAD intervention in usual care settings as delivered by peer support specialists and nonpeer clinicians on assertive community treatment (ACT) teams.Methods: A total of 145 ACT consumers were randomly assigned, within teams, to FPAD with facilitation by either a peer (N=71) or a clinician (N=74). Completion rates and PAD quality were compared with the previous study's standard and across facilitator type. Logistic regression was used to estimate effects on the likelihood of PAD completion.Results: The completion rate of 50% in the intent-to-treat sample (N=145) was somewhat inferior to the prior standard (61%), but the rate of 58% for the retained sample (those who completed a follow-up interview, N=116) was not significantly different from the standard. Rates for peers and clinicians did not differ significantly from each other for either sample. PAD quality was similar to that achieved in the prior study. Four consumer variables predicted completion: independent living status, problematic substance use, length of time served by the ACT team, and no perceived unmet need for hospitalization in crisis.Conclusions: Peers and clinicians can play a crucial role in increasing the number of consumers with PADs, an important step toward improving implementation of PADs in mental health care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this article was to inform the first-line treatment choice between cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or an antidepressant medication for treatment-naive adults with major depressive disorder by defining a neuroimaging biomarker that differentially identifies the outcomes of remission and treatment failure to these interventions.Method: Functional MRI resting-state functional connectivity analyses using a bilateral subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) seed was applied to 122 patients from the Prediction of Remission to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study who completed 12 weeks of randomized treatment with CBT or antidepressant medication. Of the 122 participants, 58 achieved remission (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D] score ≤7 at weeks 10 and 12), and 24 had treatment failure (&lt;30% decrease from baseline in HAM-D score). A 2×2 analysis of variance using voxel-wise subsampling permutation tests compared the interaction of treatment and outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curves constructed using brain connectivity measures were used to determine possible classification rates for differential treatment outcomes.Results: The resting-state functional connectivity of the following three regions with the SCC was differentially associated with outcomes of remission and treatment failure to CBT and antidepressant medication and survived application of the subsample permutation tests: the left anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex/insula, the dorsal midbrain, and the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Using the summed SCC functional connectivity scores for these three regions, overall classification rates of 72%-78% for remission and 75%-89% for treatment failure was demonstrated. Positive summed functional connectivity was associated with remission with CBT and treatment failure with medication, whereas negative summed functional connectivity scores were associated with remission to medication and treatment failure with CBT.Conclusions: Imaging-based depression subtypes defined using resting-state functional connectivity differentially identified an individual's probability of remission or treatment failure with first-line treatment options for major depression. This biomarker should be explored in future research through prospective testing and as a component of multivariate treatment prediction models.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Indigenous children living in high income countries have a consistently high prevalence of mental health problems. We aimed to identify psychosocial risk and protective factors for mental health in this setting. Methods: A systematic review of studies published between 1996 and 2016 that quantitatively evaluated the association between psychosocial variables and mental health among Indigenous children living in high income countries was conducted. Psychosocial variables were grouped into commonly occurring domains. Individual studies were judged to provide evidence for an association between a domain and either good mental health, poor mental health, or a negligible or inconsistent association. The overall quality of evidence across all studies for each domain was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. Results: Forty-seven papers were eligible (mainland US 30 [64%], Canada 8 [17%], Australia 7 [15%], Hawaii 4 [9%]), including 58,218 participants aged 4-20 years. Most papers were cross-sectional (39, 83%) and measured negative mental health outcomes (41, 87%). Children's negative cohesion with their families and the presence of adverse events appeared the most reliable predictors of increased negative mental health outcomes. Children's substance use, experiences of discrimination, comorbid internalising symptoms, and negative parental behaviour also provided evidence of associations with negative mental health outcomes. Positive family and peer relationships, high self-esteem and optimism were associated with increased positive mental health outcomes. Conclusions: Quantitative research investigating Indigenous children's mental health is largely cross-sectional and focused upon negative outcomes. Indigenous children living in high income countries share many of the same risk and protective factors associated with mental health. The evidence linking children's familial environment, psychological traits, substance use and experiences of discrimination with mental health outcomes highlights key targets for more concerted efforts to develop initiatives to improve the mental health of Indigenous children.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Assertive community treatment (ACT) is one of the few evidence-based practices for adults with severe mental illness. Interest has slowly waned for ACT implementation. Yet ACT remains an appealing services platform to achieve the triple aim of health care reform (improved health outcomes, reduced cost, and improved satisfaction) through integration of primary care and behavioral health services. This review highlights the evidence for ACT to improve general medical outcomes, reduce treatment costs, and increase access to treatment.Methods: Using a comprehensive list of relevant search terms, the authors performed a systematic literature database search for articles published through November 2015, resulting in ten articles for inclusion.Results: No studies reported on clinical outcomes of general medical comorbidities or on mortality of ACT clients. Half of the studies reporting utilization (three of six) found a decrease in emergency room usage, and three of four studies identified an increase in outpatient primary care visits. Most studies found no increase in overall medical care costs. Of the few studies reporting on quality of life, most found mild to moderate improvements.Conclusions: To date, rigorous scientific examination of the effect of ACT on the general health of the populations it serves has not been undertaken. Given ACT's similarity to emerging chronic illness medical management models, the approach seems like a natural fit for improving general medical outcomes of persons with severe mental illnesses. More research is needed that investigates the current effect of ACT teams on general medical outcomes, treatment costs, and access to care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Latino families raising children with mental health and other special health care needs report greater dissatisfaction with care compared with other families. Activation is a promising strategy to eliminate disparities. This study examined the comparative effectiveness of MePrEPA, an activation intervention for Latino parents whose children receive mental health services.Methods: A randomized controlled trial (N=172) was conducted in a Spanish-language mental health clinic to assess the effectiveness of MePrEPA, a four-week group psychoeducational intervention to enhance parent activation among Latino parents, compared with a parent-support control group. Inclusion criteria were raising a child who receives services for mental health needs and ability to attend weekly sessions. Outcomes were parent activation, education activation, quality of school interaction, and parent mental health. Effectiveness of the intervention was tested with a difference-in-difference approach estimating linear mixed models. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was examined.Results: MePrEPA enhanced parent activation (β=5.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.42-10.53), education activation (β=7.98, CI=3.01-12.94), and quality of school interaction (β=1.83, CI=.14-3.52) to a greater degree than did a parent-support control group. The intervention's impact on parent activation and education outcomes was greater for participants whose children were covered by Medicaid and were novices to therapy and those with low activation at baseline. No statistically significant effects were observed in parent mental health.Conclusions: Activation among Latino parents was improved with MePrEPA, which can be readily incorporated in current practices by mental health clinics. Future work should replicate findings in a large number of sites, adding behavioral measures and distal impacts while examining MePrEPA's effects across settings and populations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pathological anxiety is the most common type of psychiatric disorder. The current first-line anti-anxiety treatment, selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, produces a delayed onset of action with modest therapeutic and substantial adverse effects, and long-term use of the fast-acting anti-anxiety benzodiazepines causes severe adverse effects. Inhibition of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the endocannabinoid W-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) degradative enzyme, produces anti-anxiety effects without substantial "unwanted effects" of cannabinoids, but its anti-anxiety mechanism is unclear. Methods: We used behavioural, electro- physiological, morphological and mutagenesis strategies to assess the anti-anxiety mechanism of the FAAH inhibitors PF3845 and URB597. Results: PF3845 exerts rapid and long-lasting anti-anxiety effects in mice exposed acutely to stress or chronically to the stress hormone corticosterone. PF3845-induced anti-anxiety effects and in vivo long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength at the prefrontal cortical input onto the basolateral amygdala neurons are abolished in mutant mice without CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) in brain astroglial cells, but are conserved in mice without CB1R in glutamatergic neurons. Blockade of glutamate W-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and of synaptic trafficking of glutamate AMPA receptors also abolishes PF3845-induced anti-anxiety effects in mice and LTD production in rats. URB597 produces similar anti-anxiety effects, which are abolished by blockade of LTD induction in mice. Limitations: The determination of FAAH in which types of brain cells contribute to AEA degradation for the maintenance of amygdala interstitial AEA has yet to be determined. Conclusion: We propose that the rapid anti-anxiety effects of FAAH inhibition are due to AEA activation of astroglial CB1R and subsequent basolateral amygdala LTD in vivo.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mental health problems have an adverse effect on the course of cardiac disease. The integration of their diagnosis and treatment into cardiology care is generally poor. It is particularly challenging in cultural environments where mental health problems are stigmatized. The objective of the current study was to investigate the proportion of cardiac patients with depression and anxiety as well as factors associated with the presence of these symptoms in a Palestinian population.Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted on patients consecutively admitted with a new or existing cardiac diagnosis to one of the four main hospitals in Nablus, Palestine over an eight-month period. Data was obtained from hospital medical charts and an in-person interview, using a structured questionnaire with a sequence of validated instruments. All subjects were screened for depression and anxiety using the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42). Multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors among four categories (socio-demographic, clinical, psychosocial, lifestyle) independently associated with depression and anxiety.Results: In total, 1053 patients with a confirmed cardiac diagnosis were included in the study with a participation rate of 96%. Based on the CDS and DASS-42, 54% met the criteria for severe depression (CDS &gt; 100) and 19.2% for severe-to-very severe anxiety (DASS-anxiety &gt; 15), respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were more prevalent among females and less educated patients. Factors independently associated with both depressive and anxiety symptoms were post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, low level of self-esteem, high somatic symptoms, low physical and mental health component scores, active smoking, physical inactivity, and longer disease duration. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms also reported poor social support and lower resilience.Conclusion: There was a high level of depression and anxiety in this sample of cardiac patients. The results point to characteristics of patients in particular need for mental health screening and suggest possible targets for intervention such as strengthening of social support and of physical activity. The integration of mental health services into cardiac rehabilitation in Palestine and comparable cultural settings is warranted from the time of first diagnosis and onward.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is now broad consensus regarding the importance of involving users in the process of implementing guidelines. Few studies, however, have addressed this issue, let alone the implementation of guidelines for common mental health disorders. The aim of this study is to compile and describe implementation strategies and resources related to common clinical mental health disorders targeted at service users.Methods: The literature was reviewed and resources for the implementation of clinical guidelines were compiled using the PRISMA model. A mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed based on a series of categories developed ad hoc.Results: A total of 263 items were included in the preliminary analysis and 64 implementation resources aimed at users were analysed in depth. A wide variety of types, sources and formats were identified, including guides (40%), websites (29%), videos and leaflets, as well as instruments for the implementation of strategies regarding information and education (64%), self-care, or users' assessment of service quality.Conclusions: The results reveal the need to establish clear criteria for assessing the quality of implementation materials in general and standardising systems to classify user-targeted strategies. The compilation and description of key elements of strategies and resources for users can be of interest in designing materials and specific actions for this target audience, as well as improving the implementation of clinical guidelines.</ab>

        <ab>Assertive community treatment (ACT) has the potential to serve as a medical home for adults with serious mental illness, a population that experiences some of the most significant health disparities in the United States. Using site visit methodology, the authors describe partnerships that were created between five ACT programs and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to provide integrated behavioral health and primary care. The authors examined rates of screening for common chronic conditions. The programs used three distinct approaches: two programs colocated ACT teams at an FQHC, two programs employed primary care providers who split their time between the FQHC and the ACT program, and one program embedded a primary care provider within the ACT team. Effective communication between staffs may be more important than type of partnership in determining integration success.</ab>

        <ab>Art therapists working with learning disabled clients are used to adapting an art therapy model to work in a way meaningful to the individual. The attuned response to working with past trauma may often be a more interactive responsive style depending on the ability of the client to process cognitive material. This article illustrates in detail an example of an art therapy intervention which demonstrates a flexible, collaborative approach as well as presenting retrospectively gathered evidence of the outcomes of the work. It highlights the ability of an art therapy relationship to enable positive changes in a client whose distressed behaviour could not be managed by behavioural strategies or use of psycho-active medication alone.</ab>

        <ab>Although religious belief and practice are relevant to mental health outcomes, many clinicians lack knowledge of particular religious traditions required to make informed judgments about referral to and collaboration with faith-based organizations and clinicians. This Open Forum examines five diverse American Christian approaches to mental health and mental illness-pastoral care and counseling, biblical counseling, integrationism, Christian psychology, and the work of the Institute for the Psychological Sciences--that are relevant for contemporary mental health service delivery. Each of these movements is briefly described and placed in historical, conceptual, and organizational context. Knowledge of the diverse and varied terrain of American Christian engagement with mental health care can inform clinicians' interactions with faith-based providers, clarify opportunities for responsible collaboration, and provide important insight into religious subcultures with faith-based concerns about contemporary psychiatric care.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Anxiety and depressive disorders frequently occur in people with epilepsy (PWE). An information processing model of psychopathology, the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model specifies that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and processes play a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and depression. This study explored whether metacognitive beliefs would explain additional variance in anxiety and depression after accounting for demographics, physical and/or psychiatric illnesses, epilepsy characteristics and medication issues. The mediational relationships between metacognitive beliefs, worry and anxiety and depression, predicted by the metacognitive model were also explored, METHODS: Three hundred and forty-nine PWE participated in an online survey and completed self-report questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, metacognitive beliefs and worry. Participants also provided information on epilepsy characteristics, demographics, comorbid physical and/or psychiatric illnesses, number of, and perceived side effects of, anti-epileptic medication.Results: Regression analysis showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and explained additional variance in these outcomes after accounting for the control variables. Furthermore, the fundamental tenet of the metacognitive model was supported; the relationship between negative metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry and anxious and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by worry.Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that metacognitive beliefs and processes contribute to anxiety and depression beyond variables often associated with emotional distress in PWE. Further research is required to test if modification of metacognitive beliefs and processes using metacognitive therapy would effectively alleviate anxiety and depression in PWE.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Infertility is often associated with a chronic state of stress which may manifest itself in anxiety-related and depressive symptoms. The aim of our study is to assess the psychological state of women with and without fertility problems, and to investigate the background factors of anxiety-related and depressive symptoms in women struggling with infertility.Methods: Our study was conducted with the participation of 225 (134 primary infertile and 91 fertile) women, recruited in a clinical setting and online. We used the following questionnaires: Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), Shortened Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI). We also interviewed our subjects on the presence of other sources of stress (the quality of the relationship with their mother, financial and illness-related stress), and we described sociodemographic and fertility-specific characteristics. We tested our hypotheses using independent-samples t-tests (M ± SD) and multiple linear regression modelling (ß).Results: Infertile women were younger (33.30 ± 4.85 vs. 35.74 ± 5.73, p = .001), but had significantly worse psychological well-being (BDI = 14.94 ± 12.90 vs. 8.95 ± 10.49, p &lt; .0001; STAI-T = 48.76 ± 10.96 vs. 41.18 ± 11.26, p &lt; .0001) than fertile subjects. Depressive symptoms and anxiety in infertile women were associated with age, social concern, sexual concern and maternal relationship stress. Trait anxiety was also associated with financial stress. Our model was able to account for 58% of the variance of depressive symptoms and 62% of the variance of trait anxiety.Conclusions: Depressive and anxiety-related symptoms of infertile women are more prominent than those of fertile females. The measurement of these indicators and the mitigation of underlying distress by adequate psychosocial interventions should be encouraged.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This study examined how mental health clinic administrators decided whether or not to adopt evidence-based and other innovative practices by exploring their views of implementation barriers and facilitators and operation of these views in assessment of implementation costs and benefits.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 75 agency chief executive officers and program directors of 34 New York State-licensed mental health clinics serving children and adolescents.Results: Three interconnected themes relating to barriers and facilitators were identified, namely costs and benefits associated with adoption, capacity for adoption, and acceptability of new practices. The highest percentage of participants (86.7%) mentioned costs as a barrier, followed by limited capacity (55.9%) and lack of acceptability (52.9%). The highest percentage (82.3%) of participants identified available capacity as a facilitator, followed by acceptability (41.2%) and benefits or limited costs (24.0%). Assessment of costs and benefits exhibited several principles of behavioural economics, including loss aversion, temporal discounting use of heuristics, sensitivity to monetary incentives, decision fatigue, framing, and environmental influences.Conclusions: The results point to opportunities for using agency leader models to develop strategies to facilitate implementation of evidence-based and innovative practices for children and adolescents.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Large-scale health care systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have recently invested heavily in the expansion of psychotherapy services. This study examined longitudinal changes in use of psychotherapy at the VHA during a period of substantial programmatic change targeting increased availability and quality of mental health care. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used data from the VHA National Patient Care Database outpatient treatment files to identify patients with a new-onset diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder during fiscal years (FYs) 2004 (N=424,428), 2007 (N=494,318), and 2010 (N=583,733). Use of psychotherapy during the 12 months after diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS The proportion of patients receiving any psychotherapy increased across the three study time points (FY 2004, 21%; FY 2007, 22%; and FY 2010, 27%). Amount of psychotherapy also increased such that with time a growing proportion of patients received eight or more psychotherapy sessions. The median time between diagnosis and start of psychotherapy decreased from 56 to 47 days from FY 2004 to FY 2010. Consistent with VHA expansion efforts, more substantial increases in psychotherapy reach, amount, and timeliness occurred between FY 2007 and 2010 than between FY 2004 and FY 2007. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight recent increases in the use of VHA psychotherapy and correspond to substantial efforts to improve access to mental health services. Despite these advances, most newly diagnosed patients received no psychotherapy or a low-intensity amount of psychotherapy. Additional efforts to promote veteran engagement in needed mental health services appear warranted.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: People with mental illness struggle with symptoms and with public stigma. Some accept common prejudices and lose self-esteem, resulting in shame and self-stigma, which may affect their interactions with mental health professionals. This study explored whether self-stigma and shame are associated with consumers' preferences for participation in medical decision making and their behavior in psychiatric consultations.Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted in Germany, 329 individuals with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or an affective disorder and their psychiatrists provided sociodemographic and illness-related information. Self-stigma, shame, locus of control, and views about clinical decision making were assessed by self-report. Psychiatrists rated their impression of the decision-making behavior of consumers. Regression analyses and structural equation modeling were used to determine the association of self-stigma and shame with clinical decision making.Results: Self-stigma was not related to consumers' participation preferences, but it was associated with some aspects of communicative behavior. Active and critical behavior (for example, expressing views, daring to challenge the doctor's opinion, and openly speaking out about disagreements with the doctor) was associated with less shame, less self-stigma, more self-responsibility, less attribution of external control to powerful others, and more years of education.Conclusions: Self-stigma and shame were associated with less participative and critical behavior, which probably leads to clinical encounters that involve less shared decision making and more paternalistic decision making. Paternalistic decision making may reinforce self-stigma and lead to poorer health outcomes. Therefore, interventions that reduce self-stigma and increase consumers' critical and participative communication may improve health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Perinatal depression is the most common mental illness experienced by pregnant and postpartum women, yet it is often under-detected and under-treated. Some researchers suggest this may be partly influenced by a lack of education and professional development on perinatal depression among health-care providers, which can negatively affect care and contribute to stigmatization of women experiencing altered mood. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to provide a synthesis of educational and professional development needs and strategies for health-care providers in perinatal depression.Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in seven academic health databases using selected keywords. The search was limited to primary studies and reviews published in English between January 2006 and May/June 2015, with a focus on perinatal depression education and professional development for health-care providers. Studies were screened for inclusion by two reviewers and tie-broken by a third. Studies that met inclusion criteria were quality appraised and data extracted. Results from the studies are reported through narrative synthesis.Results: Two thousand one hundred five studies were returned from the search, with 1790 remaining after duplicate removal. Ultimately, 12 studies of moderate and weak quality met inclusion criteria. The studies encompassed quantitative (n = 11) and qualitative (n = 1) designs, none of which were reviews, and addressed educational needs identified by health-care providers (n = 5) and strategies for professional development in perinatal mental health (n = 7). Consistently, providers identified a lack of formal education in perinatal mental health and the need for further professional development. Although the professional development interventions were diverse, the majority focused on promoting identification of perinatal depression and demonstrated modest effectiveness in improving various outcomes.Conclusions: This systematic review reveals a lack of strong research in multi-disciplinary, sector, site, and modal approaches to education and professional development for providers to identify and care for women at risk for, or experiencing, depression. To ensure optimal health outcomes, further research comparing diverse educational and professional development approaches is needed to identify the most effective strategies and consistently meet the needs of health-care providers.Trial Registration: A protocol for this systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (Protocol number: CRD42015023701 ), June 21, 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study evaluated the effect of California's Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) on the structure, volume, location, and patient centeredness of Los Angeles County public mental health services.Methods: This prospective mixed-methods study (2006-2013) was based in five Los Angeles County public mental health clinics, all with usual care and three with full-service partnerships (FSPs). FSPs are MHSA-funded programs designed to "do whatever it takes" to provide intensive, recovery-oriented, team-based, integrated services for clients with severe mental illness. FSPs were compared with usual care on outpatient services received (claims data) and on organizational climate, recovery orientation, and provider-client working alliance (surveys and semistructured interviews), with regression adjustment for client and provider characteristics.Results: In the first year after admission, FSP clients (N=174) received significantly more outpatient services than did usual care clients (N=298) (5,238 versus 1,643 minutes, p&lt;.001), and a larger proportion of these services were field based (22% versus 2%, p&lt;.001). Compared with usual care clients, FSP clients reported more recovery-oriented services (p&lt;.001) and a better provider-client working alliance (p=.01). Compared with usual care providers (N=130), FSP providers (N=42) reported more stress (p&lt;.001) and lower morale (p&lt;.001).Conclusions: Los Angeles County's public mental health system was able to transform service delivery in response to well-funded policy mandates. For providers, a structure emphasizing accountability and patient centeredness was associated with greater stress, despite smaller caseloads. For clients, service structure and volume created opportunities to build stronger provider-client relationships and address their needs and goals.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is of significant global concern. Despite a range of effective treatment options it is estimated that around one in five diagnosed with an acute depressive episode continue to experience enduring symptoms for more than 2 years. There is evidence for effectiveness of individual music therapy for depression. However, no studies have as yet looked at a group intervention within an NHS context. This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of group music therapy for patients with long-term depression (symptom durations of 1 year or longer) within the community.Methods: This is a single-centre randomised controlled feasibility trial of group music therapy versus wait-list control with a nested process evaluation. Thirty participants will be randomised with unbalanced allocation (20 to receive the intervention immediately, 10 as wait-list controls). Group music therapy will be offered three times per week in a community centre with a focus on songwriting. Data will be collected post-intervention, 3 and 6 months after the intervention finishes. We will examine the feasibility of recruitment processes including identifying the number of eligible participants, participation and retention rates and the intervention in terms of testing components, measuring adherence and estimation of the likely intervention effect. A nested process evaluation will consist of treatment fidelity analysis, exploratory analysis of process measures and end-of-participation interviews with participants and referring staff.Discussion: Whilst group music therapy is an option in some community mental health settings, this will be the first study to examine group music therapy for this particular patient group. We will assess symptoms of depression, acceptability of the intervention and quality of life. We anticipate potential challenges in the recruitment and retention of participants. It is unclear whether offering the intervention three times per week will be acceptable to participants, particularly given participants' enduring symptoms and impact upon motivation. This study will provide data to inform both development of the intervention and to assess and inform the design of a full trial.Trial Registration: ISRCTN.com, ISRCTN18164037 .

        <ab>Background: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed.Methods: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N = 100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N = 101). Participants were interviewed every 3 months over 21/24 months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery.Results: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25 days, d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p &lt; 0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z = 5.30, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z = 4.59, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6 months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), χ2 (2, n = 170) = 11.46, p = .003, Cramer's V = 0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z = 3.83, p &lt; 0.001, ASMD = 0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z = 12.89, p &lt; 0.001, pooled ASMD = 0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z = 2.26, p = 0.03, ASMD = 0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants.Conclusions: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness.Trial Registration: International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register Identifier: ISRCTN42520374 , assigned August 18, 2009.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This community-based randomized controlled trial was carried out to test the Ending Self-Stigma (ESS) psychoeducational intervention, which is designed to help adults with serious mental illnesses reduce internalization of mental illness stigma and its effects.Methods: A total of 268 adults from five different mental health programs in Maryland took part. After baseline interview, consenting participants were randomly assigned to the nine-week ESS intervention or a minimally enhanced treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants were assessed by using symptom, psychosocial functioning, and self-stigma measures at baseline, postintervention, and six-month follow-up. Demographic characteristics were assessed at baseline.Results: Compared with participants in the control condition, ESS group participants showed significant decreases on the stereotype agreement and self-concurrence subscales of the Self Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, significant improvement on the alienation and stigma resistance subscales of the Internalized Stigma Mental Illness measure, and a significant increase in recovery orientation from baseline to postintervention. None of these differences were sustained at six-month follow-up.Conclusions: Results indicate that ESS was useful in helping to reduce key aspects of internalized stigma among individuals with mental illnesses and that advances in the delivery, targeting, and content of the intervention in the field may be warranted to increase its potency.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Xiao Yao San (XYS) is an herbal prescription which is used in the treatment of depression for thousands of years from Song dynasty in China (960-1127 A.D.), and is the bestselling and most popular herb formula for treating major depression. This study aimed to assess the chronic antidepressant effects of XYS and fluoxetine in depressed mice induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and its association with alterations in glutamate/glutamine cycle and glutamate transporters. Methods: Mice in the control and model group were given 0.5 ml physiological saline by intragastric administration. Mice in two treatment groups were given XYS (0.25 g/kg/d) and fluoxetine (2.6 mg/kg/d), respectively. The depressive-like behaviors such as forced swim test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT) and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test were measured after mice exposed to CUMS for 21 days. Body weight, contents of glutamate and glutamine, glutamine/glutamate ratio that is usually thought to reflect glutamate/glutamine cycle, and the protein and mRNA expressions of glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporter 1-2,GLAST/EAAT1 and GLT-1/EAAT2) were measured. The immunoreactivities of GLAST and GLT-1 in the hippocampus were also investigated. Results: After CUMS exposure, mice exhibited depressive-like behaviors, body weight loss, increased glutamate level, decreased glutamine level, elevated glutamine/glutamate ratio, decreased GLT-1 protein expression and mRNA level, and decreased average optical density (AOD) of GLT-1 in the CA1, CA3 and DG in the hippocampus. These abnormalities could be effectively reversed by XYS or fluoxetine treatment. In addition, the study also found that GLAST expression in the hippocampus could not be altered by 21 -d CUMS. Conclusion: The studies indicated that XYS may have therapeutic actions on depression-like behaviors induced by CUMS in mice possibly mediated by modulation of glutamate/glutamine cycle and glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the hippocampus.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments [PReDICT] study aimed to identify clinical and biological factors predictive of treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder among treatment-naive adults. The authors evaluated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and two antidepressant medications (escitalopram and duloxetine) in patients with major depression and examined the moderating effect of patients' treatment preferences on outcomes.Method: Adults aged 18-65 with treatment-naive major depression were randomly assigned with equal likelihood to 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram (10-20 mg/day), duloxetine (30-60 mg/day), or CBT (16 50-minute sessions). Prior to randomization, patients indicated whether they preferred medication or CBT or had no preference. The primary outcome was change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), administered by raters blinded to treatment.Results: A total of 344 patients were randomly assigned, with a mean baseline HAM-D score of 19.8 (SD=3.8). The mean estimated overall decreases in HAM-D score did not significantly differ between treatments (CBT: 10.2, escitalopram: 11.1, duloxetine: 11.2). Last observation carried forward remission rates did not significantly differ between treatments (CBT: 41.9%, escitalopram: 46.7%, duloxetine: 54.7%). Patients matched to their preferred treatment were more likely to complete the trial but not more likely to achieve remission.Conclusions: Treatment guidelines that recommend either an evidence-based psychotherapy or antidepressant medication for nonpsychotic major depression can be extended to treatment-naive patients. Treatment preferences among patients without prior treatment exposure do not significantly moderate symptomatic outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Despite the increasing use of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and the significant physical and emotional commitments that these treatments and procedures involve, only limited evidence exists regarding the psychological health of women who undergo ART. This study investigated the changes over time in the psychological health of women who have conceived using ART during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and during the postpartum period in Taiwan.Methods: A quantitative longitudinal study was conducted at a fertility centre in Taiwan. 158 pregnant women who had conceived using ART completed a web-based questionnaire that included the following instruments: State Anxiety Inventory, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Modified Maternal Foetal Attachment Scale, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale, Maternity Social Support Scale, Intimate Bond Measure, and Parenting Stress Index. The data were collected the first (9-12 weeks), second (19-22 weeks), third (28-31 weeks) trimesters of pregnancy and at 7-10 weeks postpartum.Results: Levels of anxiety and depression, which are both key indicators of psychological health, were highest during the first trimester, with scores of 42.30 ± 11.11 and 8.43 ± 4.44, respectively. After the first trimester, anxiety scores decreased and remained stable through the remainder of pregnancy, with scores of 38.03 ± 10.58 in the second and 38.39 ± 10.36 in the third trimester, but increased at two-months postpartum, attaining a score of 41.18 ± 11.68. Further, depression scores showed a similar pattern, declining to a mean of 7.21 ± 4.23 in the second and 6.99 ± 4.11 in the third trimester and then increasing to 8.39 ± 5.25 at two-months postpartum. Pregnancy stress and social support were found to be the most important predictors of change in psychological health during pregnancy and the postpartum period.Conclusion: Psychological health was found to be poorest during the first trimester and at two-months postpartum. Moreover, pregnancy stress and social support were identified as key predictors of change in psychological health. The findings indicate a need for increased sensitivity among healthcare professionals to the psychological vulnerability of women who have conceived using ART as well as a need to introduce tailored interventions to provide appropriate psychological support to these women.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The initial goal was to validate the use of a self-report measure of disability in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). The main goal was to document the extent of disability in personnel with and without mental disorders.Methods: Data were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey; the sample included 6700 Regular Forces personnel. Disability was measured with the 12-item version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-2); established cut points were used to demarcate severe, moderate, minimal, and no disability. The following recent (past-year) and remote (lifetime but not past-year) disorders were assessed with diagnostic interviews: posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol use disorder.Results: The WHODAS-2 showed good internal consistency (α = 0.89) and a 1-factor structure. Most personnel had no disability (59.2%) or minimal disability (30.8%). However, an important minority had moderate or severe disability (8.4% and 1.6%, respectively). Individuals with recent disorders reported greater disability than those without lifetime disorders, although many had minimal or no disability (41.2% and 24.7%, respectively). Disability increased with the number of recent disorders. Relative to those without lifetime disorders, individuals with remote disorders showed slightly greater disability, but most had no disabilty (57.1%) or minimal disability (35.0%).Conclusions: The 12-item WHODAS-2 is a valid measure of disability in the CAF. Mental disorders may be important drivers of disability in this population, although limited residual disability is seen in individuals with remote disorders.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif: L'objectif initial etait de valider l'utilisation d'un instrument d'auto-evaluation d'invalidite dans les Forces armees canadiennes (FAC). Le but principal etait de documenter l'etendue de l'invalidite chez le personnel avec et sans troubles mentaux. Methode: Les donnees ont ete obtenues de l'Enquete sur la sante mentale des Forces armees canadiennes de 2013; l'echantillon comprenait 6 700 membres de la Force reguliere. L'invalidite etait mesurée par la version en 12 items du WHODAS-2; des points de decoupage etablis ont servi a demarquer l'invalidite grave, moderée, minimale et nulle. Les troubles suivants recents (l'annee précedente) et distants (de durée de vie mais pas l'annee précedente) ont ete evalues par des entrevues diagnostiques : trouble de stress post-traumatique, episode de depression majeure, trouble d'anxiete generalisee, trouble panique, et trouble lie a l'alcool. Résultats: Le WHODAS-2 a révélé une bonne cohésion interne (α = 0,89) et une structure unifactorielle. Pour la plupart, le personnel n'avait pas d'invalidite (59,2%) ou une invalidite minimale (30,8%). Cependant, une importante minorite avait une invalidite moderee ou grave (8,4% et 1,6%, respectivement). Les personnes ayant des troubles recents ont declare une plus grande invalidite que ceux n'ayant pas de troubles de durée de vie, meme si beaucoup avaient une invalidite minimale ou nulle (41,2% et 24,7%, respectivement). L'invalidite augmentait avec le nombre de troubles recents. Relativement a ceux n'ayant pas de troubles de durée de vie, ceux ayant des troubles distants indiquaient une invalidite legerement plus elevee, mais la plupart n'avait pas d'invalidite (57,1%) ou une invalidite minimale (35,0%). Conclusions: Le WHODAS-2 en 12 items est une mesure valide de l'invalidite dans les FAC. Les troubles mentaux peuvent etre d'importants facteurs d'invalidite dans cette population, bien qu'une invalidite résiduelle limitee s'observe chez ceux ayant des troubles distants.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Quality improvement interventions for depression care have been shown to be effective for improving quality of care and depression outcomes in settings with primarily insured patients. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a collaborative care intervention for depression that was tailored for low-income Latino patients seen in public-sector clinics.Methods: A total of 400 depressed patients from three public-sector primary care clinics were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a tailored collaborative care intervention versus enhanced usual care. Social workers without previous mental health experience served as depression care specialists for the intervention patients (N=196). Depending on patient preference, they delivered a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention or facilitated antidepressant medication given by primary care providers or both. In enhanced usual care, patients (N=204) received a pamphlet about depression, a letter for their primary care provider stating that they had a positive depression screen, and a list of local mental health resources. Intent-to-treat analyses examined clinical and process-of-care outcomes at 16 weeks.Results: Compared with patients in the enhanced usual care group, patients in the intervention group had significantly improved depression, quality of life, and satisfaction outcomes (p&lt;.001 for all). Intervention patients also had significantly improved quality-of-care indicators, including the proportion of patients receiving either psychotherapy or antidepressant medication (77% versus 21%, p&lt;.001).Conclusions: Collaborative care for depression can greatly improve care and outcomes in public-sector clinics. Social workers without prior mental health experience can effectively provide CBT and manage depression care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Excessive smartphone use has been associated with numerous psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of smartphone addiction and its association with depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a large sample of Korean adolescents. Methods: A total of 4512 (2034 males and 2478 females) middle- and high-school students in South Korea were included in this study. Subjects were asked to complete a self-reported questionnaire, including measures of the Korean Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Conners-Wells' Adolescent Self-Report Scale (CASS). Smartphone addiction and non-addiction groups were defined using SAS score of 42 as a cut-off. The data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: 338 subjects (7.5%) were categorized to the addiction group. Total SAS score was positively correlated with total CASS score, BDI score, BAI score, female sex, smoking, and alcohol use. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio of ADHD group compared to the non-ADHD group for smartphone addiction was 6.43, the highest among all variables (95% CI 4.60–9.00). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ADHD may be a significant risk factor for developing smartphone addiction. The neurobiological substrates subserving smartphone addiction may provide insights on to both shared and discrete mechanisms with other brain-based disorders.</ab>

        <ab>To document the use of prescribed psychoactive medicines in France in patients recovering from alcohol use disorders (AUDs).~Aim~Unassigned~Survey among short- and long-term abstainers attending groups of French self-help associations for AUDs, recording socio-demographic profile, duration of abstinence, prescription of psychoactive medication and attitudes towards that, and whether or not in medical or psychological follow-up for AUD.~Method~Unassigned~Five hundred seventy-five abstainers participated. More than a half had stopped drinking for at least 5 years. About 25% of the very long-term abstainers were still in follow-up. Benzodiazepines, then antidepressants, were the most frequently used medication. Prescriptions of medication decreased with length of abstinence; was always higher in women than in men and in those with a medical follow-up. About 45% claimed that they were 'dependent' on their pills. Ten years after having stopping drinking, 19 and 42.1% of men and women, respectively, were still under medication. Cluster analysis of self-opinion on medication showed that in ~30% of the subjects medication seemed to be prescribed for precautionary reasons.~Result~Unassigned~Psychoactive medication in France is frequently prescribed for years following alcohol withdrawal. While it is possible that this is over-prescription, and further work in this regard is needed, changes in an on-going treatment for a given patient would need to be cautious.~Conclusion~Unassigned~Psychoactive medication in alcohol use disorders often prescribed for long-term abstainers in France. Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are the most frequently prescribed drugs. Prescription is more frequent in women and in those subjects having medical follow-up for their alcohol problem. Over-prescription is discussed.~Short summary~Unassigned</ab>

        <ab>Background: Obstetricians are often reluctant to grant requests for an elective cesarean section (ECS) due to childbirth fear. To date, it is unknown if an ECS on request improves mental well-being in the mother in the peripartum period and if possible beneficial effects on anxiety and depression could outweigh the increased risk of complications associated with a surgical delivery. A systematic review was conducted to explore the effect of ECS on request on peripartum anxiety and depression.Methods: We searched on PubMed, PsychoInfo and Embase. Studies were included with primary data on anxiety and/or depression postpartum in women with childbirth fear who had requested an ECS. After full-text evaluation of 65 papers and quality analysis of four papers, three papers were included. Of one paper additional and yet unpublished data were provided. Studies varied in outcome measures, hence no meta-analysis was performed.Results: Women who requested an ECS had higher antepartum depression and anxiety levels but no different postpartum depression levels than women who delivered vaginally. One study of good quality examined the effect of vaginal delivery in women preferring ECS: These women had significantly higher symptom levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression than women with normal vaginal delivery.Conclusions: The prospect of an ECS does not lower antepartum anxiety and/or depression levels in women requesting an ECS. If women resolutely persist in wishing an ECS despite adequate counselling and/or psychiatric treatment, the risk of developing depressive and PTSD symptoms in case of vaginal delivery should be taken into account, and an ECS may be considered as a valid alternative.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This cluster-randomised monocentric controlled trial focuses on improving the uptake symptoms of mental health care in adolescents with chronic medical conditions who have been identified by screening to have depression or anxiety. The study aims to determine the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI) delivered by trained physicians to increase 12- to 20-year-old adolescents' utilisation of psychological health care for symptoms of anxiety or depression.Methods/design: In this single-centre approach, n = 1,000 adolescents will be screened (using PHQ-9 and GAD-7), and adolescents with results indicative of anxiety or depressive symptoms (n = 162) will be advised to seek psychological health care in clusters from treating physicians in specialised outpatient departments. Participants who screen positive will receive either two sessions of MI or treatment as usual (TAU; regarded as the typical daily clinical practice), which is focused on recommending them to seek psychological health care for further evaluation. MI efficacy will be compared to the current TAU as the control condition. The primary outcome is the utilisation rate of psychological health care after counselling by an MI-trained physician vs. an untrained physician. Additionally, reasons for not claiming psychological support and changes in disease-related parameters will be evaluated in a 6-month follow-up session.Discussion: This trial will evaluate the feasibility of MI as a way to improve the utilisation of mental health-care services by adolescents who need further support other than that provided by standard care for chronic diseases. Physicians offering MI to adolescents may serve as a model for optimising health-care management in daily clinical practice, which may improve adolescents' long-term well-being by improving adherence to medical treatment and preventing negative lifelong consequences into adulthood.Trial Registration: German Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS00014043 .

        <ab>Objective: Housing First with assertive community treatment (ACT) is a promising approach to assist people with serious mental illness to exit homelessness. The article presents two-year findings from a multisite trial on the effectiveness of Housing First with ACT.Methods: The study design was a randomized controlled trial conducted in five Canadian cities. A sample of 950 participants with serious mental illness who were absolutely homeless or precariously housed were randomly assigned to receive either Housing First with ACT (N=469) or treatment as usual (N=481).Results: Housing First participants spent more time in stable housing than participants in treatment as usual (71% versus 29%, adjusted absolute difference [AAD]=42%, p&lt;.01). Compared with treatment-as-usual participants, Housing First participants who entered housing did so more quickly (73 versus 220 days, AAD=146.4, p&lt;.001), had longer housing tenures at the study end-point (281 versus 115 days, AAD=161.8, p&lt;.01), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (adjusted standardized mean difference [ASMD]=.17, p&lt;.01). Housing First participants reported higher quality of life (ASMD=.15, p&lt;.01) and were assessed as having better community functioning (ASMD=.18, p&lt;.01) over the two-year period. Housing First participants showed significantly greater gains in community functioning and quality of life in the first year; however, differences between the two groups were attenuated by the end of the second year.Conclusions: Housing First with ACT is an effective approach in various contexts for assisting individuals with serious mental illness to rapidly exit homelessness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has been developed for the treatment of depression but has been examined for several other mental disorders. A comprehensive meta-analysis of all randomized trials examining the effects of IPT for all mental health problems was conducted.Method: Searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Cochrane were conducted to identify all trials examining IPT for any mental health problem.Results: Ninety studies with 11,434 participants were included. IPT for acute-phase depression had moderate-to-large effects compared with control groups (g=0.60; 95% CI=0.45-0.75). No significant difference was found with other therapies (differential g=0.06) and pharmacotherapy (g=-0.13). Combined treatment was more effective than IPT alone (g=0.24). IPT in subthreshold depression significantly prevented the onset of major depression, and maintenance IPT significantly reduced relapse. IPT had significant effects on eating disorders, but the effects are probably slightly smaller than those of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the acute phase of treatment. In anxiety disorders, IPT had large effects compared with control groups, and there is no evidence that IPT was less effective than CBT. There was risk of bias as defined by the Cochrane Collaboration in the majority of studies. There was little indication that the presence of bias influenced outcome.Conclusions: IPT is effective in the acute treatment of depression and may be effective in the prevention of new depressive disorders and in preventing relapse. IPT may also be effective in the treatment of eating disorders and anxiety disorders and has shown promising effects in some other mental health disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) program on psychiatric symptoms, global functioning, life satisfaction, and recovery-promoting relationships among individuals with mental illness.Methods: Participants were patients at the Suwon Mental Health Center. Thirty-two patients were part of the ACT program and 32 patients matched for age, sex, and mental illness were in a standard case-management program and served as a control group. Follow-up with patients occurred every 3 months during the 15 months after a baseline interview. Participants completed the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, and Recovery-Promoting Relationship Scale (RPRS).Results: No significant differences were noted in the sociodemographic characteristics of the ACT and the case-management group. According to the BPRS, the ACT group showed a significant reduction in symptom severity, but the ACT program was not significantly more effective at reducing psychiatric symptoms from baseline to the 15-month follow-up compared to the case-management approach. The ACT group showed more significant improvement than the control group in terms of the GAF Scale. Both groups showed no significant differences in the change of life satisfaction and in the change of recovery-promoting relationships. We observed a significant increase in recovery-promoting relationships in the control group, but the degree of change of recovery-promoting relationships through time flow between groups was not significantly different.Discussion: In this study, we observed that ACT was significantly better at improving the GAF than case management and that participation in ACT was associated with a significant decrease in BPRS scores. However, ACT did not demonstrate an absolute superiority over the standard case-management approach in terms of the BPRS and the measures of life satisfaction and recovery-promoting relationships.Conclusions: ACT may have some advantages over a standard case management approach.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the quality of mental healthcare provided to patients with schizophrenic disorders in the Italian region of Lombardy.Design: Forty-one clinical indicators were applied to Lombardy's healthcare databases containing data on mental health treatments, hospital admissions, somatic health treatments and pharmaceutical prescriptions.Setting: All public departments of mental health and private residential facilities in Lombardy.Participants: All 28 227 patients with schizophrenic disorders that were under the care of Lombardy mental health services in 2009.Interventions: N/A.Main outcome measures: N/A.Results: The care that was delivered to patients and family members was more frequent for first-episode cases than for prevalent ones. Seven out of ten patients made use of continuing care and, after hospitalization, more than half of the discharged patients received a follow-up visit by community mental health centre staff within 2 weeks of their discharge. Psychotherapeutic and psychoeducative treatments, such as employment and independent living support, were not widespread among these discharged patients. Antipsychotic drug dosage was usually within the recommended range. The adherence of first-episode patients to antipsychotic treatment was lower than that of prevalent patients, and the monitoring of metabolic side effects was not always consistent. Inappropriateness of hospital care, in terms of longer admission, readmission, compulsory admission and restraint, was limited. Mortality during the period was significant.Conclusions: Clinical indicators demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the mental health system in Lombardy and they can be useful tools in the routine assessment of mental healthcare quality.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo: Evaluar la calidad de la atención de salud mental proporcionada a los pacientes con trastornos esquizofrénicos en la región italiana de Lombardía. Diseño: Cuarenta y un indicadores clínicos fueron aplicados a las bases de datos de salud de Lombardía que contenían datos sobre los tratamientos de salud mental, las admisiones hospitalarias, los tratamientos de salud somáticos y prescripciones farmacéuticas. Entorno: Todos los departamentos públicos de salud mental y los centros residenciales privados en Lombardía. Participantes: Los 28.227 pacientes con trastornos esquizofrénicos que estaban bajo la atención de los servicios de salud mental de Lombardía en 2009. Intervenciones: N/A. Principales medidas de resultado: N/A. Resultados: La atención realizada a pacientes y familiares era más frecuente en los casos de primeros episodios que para los prevalentes. Siete de cada diez pacientes hicieron uso de la atención continuada y, después de la hospitalización, más de la mitad de los pacientes dados de alta recibió una visita de seguimiento por personal del centro de salud mental comunitario dentro de las dos semanas siguientes a su alta. Tratamientos terapéuticos y psicoeducativos, tales como apoyo al empleo y a la vida independiente, no eran muy difundidos entre estos pacientes dados de alta. La dosis del fármaco antipsicótico era, por lo general, dentro de los límites recomendados. La adherencia al tratamiento antipsicótico de los pacientes con un primer episodio era menor que la de los pacientes prevalentes, y el seguimiento de los efectos secundarios en su metabolismo no siempre era consistente. La inadecuación de la atención hospitalaria, en términos de admisiones más largas, readmisiones, admisiones obligadas y uso de contenciones, fue limitada. La mortalidad durante el período fue significativa. Conclusión: Los indicadores clínicos demuestran las fortalezas y debilidades del sistema de salud mental en Lombardía y pueden ser herramientas útiles en la evaluación sistemática de la calidad de la salud mental.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif: Evaluer la qualité de la prise en charge des troubles schizophréniques dans la région de Lombardie (Italie). Schéma: 41 indicateurs cliniques ont été recueillis, à partir des bases de données de santé de Lombardie, concernant les traitements psychiatriques et somatiques, les hospitalisations et les prescriptions médicamenteuses. Cadre de l'étude: Tous les services de santé mentale, publics et privés, en Lombardie. Population: L'ensemble des 28 227 patients schizophrènes soignés dans les services de santé mentale de Lombardie en 2009. Interventions évaluées: sans objet. Critère de jugement principal: sans objet. Résultats: Les soins dispensés aux patients et à leur famille ont été plus fréquents lors du premier épisode de la maladie que lors des épisodes suivants. Sept patients sur dix ont bénéficié de soins prolongés et plus de la moitié des patients a bénéficié d'une visite de suivi par un membre de l'équipe du centre de santé mentale dans les deux semaines suivant leur sortie d'hospitalisation. Les traitements psychothérapeutiques ou psychoéducatifs, tels qu'une aide favorisant l'emploi et l'autonomie à domicile, n'ont pas été proposés systématiquement aux patients sortants. La posologie du médicament antipsychotique était habituellement conforme aux posologies recommandées. L'observance au traitement antipsychotique était moins bonne pour les patients ayant vécu un premier épisode de la maladie que pour les patients ayant vécu plusieurs épisodes. Le suivi des effets indésirables métaboliques n'a pas toujours été effectué. Lors de la prise en charge hospitalière, les événements du type long séjour, réadmission, placement d'office étaient limités. La mortalité durant la période était significative. Conclusions: Les indicateurs cliniques ont mis en évidence les points forts et les points faibles du système de santé mentale en Lombardie et pourraient être utilisés en routine pour évaluer la qualité de la prise en charge en santé mentale.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Perinatal anxiety and depression are widespread, with up to 20% of women affected during pregnancy and after birth. In the UK, management of perinatal mental health falls under the remit of general practitioners (GPs). We reviewed the literature on GPs' routine recognition, diagnosis and management of anxiety and depression in the perinatal period.Method: A systematic search of Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted. Studies were eligible if they reported quantitative measures of GPs' or Family Physicians' assessment, recognition and management of anxiety or depression in pregnancy or post-partum.Results: Thirteen papers, reporting 10 studies, were identified from the United States, Australia, UK, Netherlands and Canada. All reported on depression; two included anxiety disorders. Reported awareness and ability to diagnose perinatal depression among GPs was high. GPs knew about and used screening tools in the UK but less so in US settings. Antidepressants were the first line of treatment, with various SSRIs considered safest. Counseling by GPs and referrals to specialists were common in the post-natal period, less so in pregnancy. Treatment choices were determined by resources, attitudes, knowledge and training.Conclusions: Data on GPs' awareness and management of perinatal depression were sparse and unlikely to be generalizable. Future directions for research are proposed; such as exploring the management of anxiety disorders which are largely missing from the literature, and understanding more about barriers to disclosure and recognition in primary care. More standardized training could help to improve recognition and management practices.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This descriptive study aimed to investigate adolescents' motivations for participating in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), to explore the understanding that the young people had regarding a number of aspects of the trial design, to examine whether or not they found participation in the trial to be acceptable and what affected this, and to identify whether and how the young people felt that their participation in the RCT impacted on their experience of therapy and on therapeutic change.Methods: Seventy-six adolescents who were taking part in a large-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of psychological therapies for depression were interviewed at two time-points after completing therapy. The semi-structured interviews, which included a focus on the young people's experience of the research study, were analysed using framework analysis.Results: The vast majority of adolescents found it acceptable to participate in the clinical trial, and many agreed to participate for reasons of 'conditional altruism'. However consent was often given without great understanding of the key elements of the trial, including the difference between treatment arms and the randomisation process. Although the adolescents were largely positive about their experiences from taking part, the study raises questions about whether clinical outcomes may be influenced by participation in the research elements of the trial.Conclusions: Although adolescents are under-represented in clinical trials, those who do participate are generally positive about the experience; however, careful thought needs to be given to key elements of the trial design and the potential impact of the research participation on clinical outcomes.Trial Registration: ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN83033550 .

        <ab>Objective: Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) provides an alternative to fixed-length assessments. The study validated a suite of computerized adaptive tests for mental health (CAT-MH) in a community psychiatric sample.Methods: A total of 145 adults from a community outpatient clinic, including 19 with no history of a mental disorder (control group), were prospectively evaluated with CAT for depression (CAD-MDD and CAT-DI), mania (CAT-MANIA), and anxiety symptoms (CAT-ANX). Ratings were compared with gold-standard psychiatric assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-25), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).Results: Sensitivity and specificity for CAD-MDD were .96 and .64, respectively (.96 and 1.00 for major depression versus the control group). CAT for depression severity (CAT-DI) correlated well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.79), PHQ-9 (r=.90), and CES-D (r=.90) and had an odds ratio (OR) of 27.88 across its range for current SCID major depressive disorder. CAT-ANX correlated with the HAM-D-25 (r=.73), PHQ-9 (r=.78), and CES-D (r=.81) and had an OR of 11.52 across its range for current SCID generalized anxiety disorder. CAT-MANIA did not correlate well with the HAM-D-25 (r=.31), PHQ-9 (r=.37), and CES-D (r=.39), but it had an OR of 11.56 across its range for a current SCID bipolar diagnosis. Participants found the CAT-MH acceptable and easy to use, averaging 51.7 items and 9.4 minutes to complete the full battery.Conclusions: Compared with gold-standard diagnostic and assessment measures, CAT-MH provided an effective, rapidly administered assessment of psychiatric symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Previous research suggests benefits of yoga in reducing depression and anxiety. However, common concerns in reviews of the research include lack of detail, rationale and consistency of approach of interventions used. Issues related to heterogeneity include amount, types and delivery of yoga interventions. This study aims to document consensus-based recommendations for consistency of yoga interventions for reducing depression and anxiety. Methods: The Delphi method was used to establish consensus from experienced yoga teachers. Thirty-three eligible teachers were invited to participate, from four different countries. Two rounds of an online survey were sent to participants. The first round sought initial views. The second round sought consensus on a summary of those views. Survey questions related to frequency and duration (dosage) of the yoga, approaches and techniques to be included or avoided, and training and experience for yoga teachers. Results: Twenty-four teachers agreed to participate. Eighteen completed the second round (n = 18). General consensus (&gt;75% of participants in agreement) was achieved on parameters of practice (dosage): an average of 30 to 40 minutes, to be done 5 times per week, over a period of 6 weeks. Numerous recommendations for yoga techniques to include or avoid were collected in the first round. The second round produced a consensus statement on those recommendations. Breath regulation and postures were considered very important or essential for people with depression; and relaxation, breath regulation and meditation being very important or essential for people with anxiety. Other recommended components also achieved consensus. There was also general consensus that it is very important or essential for teachers to have a minimum of 500 training hours over 2 years, at least 2 years teaching experience, training in developing personalised yoga practices, training in yoga for mental health, and professional supervision or mentoring. Conclusions: The Delphi process has achieved a consensus statement on the application of yoga for reducing anxiety and depression. This consensus provides a checklist for identification of commonalities and evaluation of past research. Future research can proceed to develop and evaluate consensus-based yoga intervention protocols for the reduction of anxiety and depression, and improvements in well-being.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prenatal anxiety and depression are distressing for the expectant mother and can have adverse effects on her fetus and subsequently, her child. This study aimed to determine whether listening to specially composed songs would be an effective intervention for reducing symptoms of prenatal anxiety and depression. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited online and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the music group (daily listening to specially composed songs) or control group (daily relaxation) for 12 weeks each. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess symptoms of State and Trait anxiety (Spielberger) and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)). Trait anxiety was measured as the primary outcome, while State anxiety and depression were the secondary outcomes. 111 participants were randomised to each group. 20 participants in theinterventiongroupand16participantsinthe active control group completed the study. Results: The music group demonstrated lower Trait Anxiety (p = .0001) (effect size 0.80), State Anxiety (p =.02) (effect size 0.64), and EPDS (p = .002) (effect size 0.92) scores at week 12 compared to baseline, by paired t test. There were no such changes in the control group. Conclusions: Though this pilot study had high levels of attrition, the results do suggest that regular listening to relaxing music should be explored further as an effective non-pharmacological means for reducing prenatal anxiety and depression.

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of this study was to systematically review the rates of nonadherence to oral maintenance treatment in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to describe perceived barriers to adherence and psychosocial factors involved.Methods: The article considered studies published in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO up to March 2015. Studies that had collected data on adherence to thiopurines or aminosalicylates in a cohort of adolescents with IBD. Case reports and case series were excluded.Results: A total of 25 studies were included. Lack of uniformity of outcome measures made pooling of data impossible. Rates of medication nonadherence ranged from 2% to 93%. The most frequently reported barriers were "just forgot," "wasn't home," and "interferes with activity." Family dysfunction, peer victimization, poor health-related quality of life, poor child-coping strategies, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were associated with medication nonadherence.Conclusions: Nonadherence to oral maintenance therapy in adolescents with IBD is a significant health care problem and can lead to unnecessary escalation in therapy. Difficulties in family and social interactions, and psychosocial dysfunction can jeopardize IBD treatment outcome and should receive attention early in the course of the disease.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study examined whether same-day integrated mental health services are associated with increased diagnosis and treatment initiation among primary care patients with positive posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) screens.Methods: Data were from a national sample of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care patients with a positive PTSD screen (N=21,427). Patients were assessed for PTSD diagnosis and treatment initiation on the screening day and ≤ 7 days, ≤ 12 weeks, ≤ 6 months, and ≤ 1 year after screening positive. The service setting on screening day was categorized as primary care only, same-day primary care-mental health integration (PC-MHI), or same-day specialty mental health care. Multivariable generalized estimating equations logistic regression was used to estimate associations between category of screening day services and diagnosis and treatment initiation, with adjustment for demographic characteristics, prior psychiatric diagnoses, prior VHA service utilization, and PTSD screen score.Results: Of the 21,427 patients with positive PTSD screens, 10,809 (50.4%) received a diagnosis within one year of screening positive. Same-day PC-MHI services were associated with greater odds of PTSD diagnosis, both on the same day as (odds ratio [OR]=2.23) and one year (OR=1.67) after screening positive compared with primary care-only services (p&lt;.001). Among those who received a diagnosis on the same day as their positive screen, same-day PC-MHI services were associated with increased odds of initiating PTSD treatment (OR=3.39) within 12 weeks of diagnosis, compared with primary care only (p&lt;.001).Conclusions: Same-day integrated mental health services may help facilitate PTSD diagnosis and treatment initiation after a positive screen.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There are inherent methodological challenges in the measurement of mental health problems in longitudinal research. There is constant development in definitions, taxonomies and demands concerning the properties of mental health measurements. The aim of this paper was to construct composite measures of mental health problems (according to today's standard) from single questionnaire items devised in the early 1980s, and to evaluate their internal consistency and factorial invariance across the life course using the Northern Swedish Cohort.Methods: All pupils in the last year of compulsory school in Luleå in 1981 (n = 1083) form a prospective cohort study where the participants have been followed with questionnaires from the age of 16 (in 1981) until the age of 43 (in 2008). We created and tested the following composite measures from self-reports at each follow-up: depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, functional somatic symptoms, modified GHQ and positive health. Validity and internal consistency were tested by confirmatory factor analysis, including tests of factorial invariance over time.Results: As an overall assessment, the results showed that the composite measures (based on more than 30-year-old single item questions) are likely to have acceptable factorial invariance as well as internal consistency over time.Conclusions: Testing the properties of the mental health measures used in older studies according to the standards of today is of great importance in longitudinal research. Our study demonstrates that composite measures of mental health problems can be constructed from single items which are more than 30 years old and that these measures seem to have the same factorial structure and internal consistency across a significant part of the life course. Thus, it can be possible to overcome some specific inherent methodological challenges in using historical data in longitudinal research.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among women. Women with CVD experience a greater burden of psychosocial distress than men, and practice guidelines promote screening in cardiac patients, especially women. The objectives herein were to describe the burden of psychosocial distress, extent of screening, forms of treatment, and whether receipt of treatment was related to psychosocial distress symptom severity at follow-up, among women.Methods: Within a multi-center trial of women randomized to cardiac rehabilitation models, consenting participants were asked to complete surveys upon consent and 6 months later. Clinical data were extracted from charts. This study presents a secondary analysis of the surveys, including investigator-generated items assessing screening and treatment, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-2.Results: Of the 128 (67.0%) participants with valid baseline and follow-up survey results, 48 (40.3%) self-reported that they recalled being screened, and of these, 10 (21.3%) recalled discussing the results with a health care professional. Fifty-six (43.8%) retained participants had elevated symptoms of psychosocial distress at baseline, of which 25 (44.6%) were receiving treatment. Regression analyses showed that treatment of psychosocial distress was not significantly associated with follow-up depressive symptoms, but was significantly associated with greater follow-up anxiety.Conclusions: Findings reiterate the great burden of psychosocial distress among women with CVD. Less than half of patients with elevated symptoms were treated, and the treatment approaches appeared to insufficiently achieve symptom relief.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Treatment services to patients with substance use disorders (SUDs), including those mandated to treatment, needs to be evaluated and evidence based. The Norwegian Municipal Health Care Act (NMHCA) calls for compulsory treatment for persons with "severe and life-threatening substance use disorder" if these individuals are not otherwise willing to be voluntarily treated and consequently risk their lives over drug use. Mental distress is known to be high among SUD patients admitted to inpatient treatment. The purpose of this study is to describe changes in mental distress from admission to a 6-month follow-up in patients with SUDs, which underwent either voluntary or compulsory treatment.Method: This prospective study followed 202 hospitalized patients with SUDs who were admitted voluntarily (VA; n = 137) or compulsorily (CA; n = 65). Levels of mental distress were assessed with SCL-90-R. Of 123 patients followed-up at 6 months, 97 (62 VA and 35 CA) had rated their mental distress at admission, discharge and follow-up. Sociodemographics and substance use severity were recorded with the use of The European Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI). We performed a regression analysis to examine factors associated with changes in psychiatric distress at the 6-month follow-up.Results: The VA group exhibited higher mental distress than the CA group at admission, but both groups improved significantly during treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, the VA group continued to show reduced distress, but the CA group showed increases in mental distress to the levels observed before treatment. The deterioration appeared to be associated with higher scores that reflected paranoid ideas, somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, and depression. Active substance use during follow-up was significantly associated with increased mental distress.Conclusion: In-patient treatment reduces mental distress for both CA and VA patients. The time after discharge seems critical especially for CA patients regarding active substance use and severe mental distress. A greater focus on continuing care initiatives to assist the CA patients after discharge is needed to maintain the reduction in mental distress during treatment. Continuing-care initiatives after discharge should be intensified to assist patients in maintaining the reduced mental distress achieved with treatment.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00970372 December 02, 2016.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression and binge drinking behaviours are common clinical problems, which cause substantial functional, economic and health impacts. These conditions peak in young adulthood, and commonly co-occur. Comorbid depression and binge drinking are undertreated in young people, who are reluctant to seek help via traditional pathways to care. The iTreAD project (internet Treatment for Alcohol and Depression) aims to provide and evaluate internet-delivered monitoring and treatment programs for young people with depression and binge drinking concerns.Methods: Three hundred sixty nine participants will be recruited to the trial, and will be aged 18-30 years will be eligible for the study if they report current symptoms of depression (score 5 or more on the depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and concurrent binge drinking practices (5 or more standard drinks at least twice in the prior month). Following screening and online baseline assessment, participants are randomised to: (a) online monthly self-assessments, (b) online monthly self-assessments + 12-months of access to a 4 week online automated cognitive behaviour therapy program for binge drinking and depression (DEAL); or (c) online monthly assessment + DEAL + 12-months of access to a social networking site (Breathing Space). Independent, blind follow-up assessments occur at 26, 39, 52 and 64-weeks post-baseline.Discussion: The iTreAD project is the first randomised controlled trial combining online cognitive behaviour therapy, social networking and online monitoring for young people reporting concerns with depression and binge drinking. These treatments represent low-cost, wide-reach youth-appropriate treatment, which will have significantly public health implications for service design, delivery and health policy for this important age group.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12614000310662.

        <ab>Objective: The study sought to identify the extent to which posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses are recorded in the electronic health record (EHR) in Army behavioral health clinics and to assess clinicians' reasons for not recording them and treatment factors associated with recording or not recording the diagnosis.Methods: A total of 543 Army mental health providers completed the anonymous, Web-based survey. Clinicians reported clinical data for 399 service member patients, of whom 110 (28%) had a reported PTSD diagnosis. Data were weighted to account for sampling design and nonresponses.Results: Of those given a diagnosis of PTSD by their clinician, 59% were reported to have the diagnosis recorded in the EHR, and 41% did not. The most common reason for not recording was reducing stigma or protecting the service member's career prospects. Psychiatrists were more likely than psychologists or social workers to record the diagnosis.Conclusions: Findings indicate that for many patients presenting with PTSD in Army behavioral health clinics at the time of the survey (2010), clinicians did not record a PTSD diagnosis in the EHR, often in an effort to reduce stigma. This pattern may exist for other diagnoses. Recent Army policy has provided guidance to clinicians on diagnostic recording practice. An important implication concerns the reliance on coded diagnoses in PTSD surveillance efforts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The problem of underestimated prevalence rates may be further compounded by overly narrow DoD surveillance definitions of PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Morita Therapy, a psychological therapy for common mental health problems, is in sharp contrast to established western psychotherapeutic approaches in teaching that undesired symptoms are natural features of human emotion rather than something to control or eliminate. The approach is widely practiced in Japan, but untested and little known in the UK. A clinical trial of Morita Therapy is required to establish the effectiveness of Morita Therapy for a UK population. However, a number of methodological, procedural and clinical uncertainties associated with such a trial first require addressing.Methods/design: The Morita Trial is a mixed methods study addressing the uncertainties associated with an evaluation of Morita Therapy compared with treatment as usual for depression and anxiety. We will undertake a pilot randomised controlled trial with embedded qualitative study. Sixty participants with major depressive disorder, with or without anxiety disorders, will be recruited predominantly from General Practice record searches and randomised to receive Morita Therapy plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Morita Therapy will be delivered by accredited psychological therapists. We will collect quantitative data on depressive symptoms, general anxiety, attitudes and quality of life at baseline and four month follow-up to inform future sample size calculations; and rates of recruitment, retention and treatment adherence to assess feasibility. We will undertake qualitative interviews in parallel with the trial, to explore people's views of Morita Therapy. We will conduct separate and integrated analyses on the quantitative and qualitative data.Discussion: The outcomes of this study will prepare the ground for the design and conduct of a fully-powered evaluation of Morita Therapy plus treatment as usual versus treatment as usual alone, or inform a conclusion that such a trial is not feasible and/or appropriate. We will obtain a more comprehensive understanding of these issues than would be possible from either a quantitative or qualitative approach alone.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN17544090 registered on 23 July 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Psychological interventions may be beneficial in bipolar disorder.Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of psychological interventions for adults with bipolar disorder.Method: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials was conducted. Outcomes were meta-analysed using RevMan and confidence assessed using the GRADE method.Results: We included 55 trials with 6010 participants. Moderate-quality evidence associated individual psychological interventions with reduced relapses at post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.92) and follow-up (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87), and collaborative care with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.94). Low-quality evidence associated group interventions with fewer depression relapses at post-treatment and follow-up, and family psychoeducation with reduced symptoms of depression and mania.Conclusions: There is evidence that psychological interventions are effective for people with bipolar disorder. Much of the evidence was of low or very low quality thereby limiting our conclusions. Further research should identify the most effective (and cost-effective) interventions for each phase of this disorder.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Depression is pervasive and costly, and the majority of depression is treated in primary care. The objective of this study was to identify patient characteristics predictive of poor depression outcomes in primary care clinics.Methods: This observational study followed 792 patients receiving usual care for depression in 83 clinics across Minnesota for at least six months between 2008 and 2010. The primary outcome was an ordinal outcome of remission or response without remission ("response") six months after the start of treatment. The outcome was assessed via telephone administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Associations of patient characteristics with the primary outcome were assessed by using ordinal logistic regression.Results: The majority of patients were female, Caucasian, and employed, and most had some college education and good, very good, or excellent self-rated health. At baseline, 32% had mild depression, 40% moderate depression, 20% moderately severe depression, and 8% severe depression. One-third of patients had psychotherapy or psychiatric care in addition to antidepressant medications. At six months, only 47% of patients obtained depression remission or response. Patients were significantly less likely to experience remission or response if they rated their health as poor or fair or if they were unemployed and were more likely to achieve remission or response if they were younger or had mild depression.Conclusions: Patients with poor or fair health or who were unemployed were less likely to respond to usual depression care and may be good candidates for limited, but potentially more effective, intensive treatment resources for depression.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide, indicating the importance of effective therapies. Outcome studies have shown overall efficacy of different types of psychotherapy across groups, yet large variability within groups. Although patient characteristics are considered crucial in understanding outcome, they have received limited research attention. This trial aims at investigating the interaction between therapeutic approach (pre-structured versus explorative) and the personality style of patients (dependent versus self-critical), which is considered a core underlying dimension of depressive pathology.Methods/design: This study is a pragmatic stratified (dependent and self-critical patients) parallel trial with equal randomization (allocation 1:1) conducted in Flanders, Belgium. One hundred and four patients will be recruited and randomized to either 16-20 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression (pre-structured approach) or 16-20 sessions of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for depression (explorative approach) conducted by trained psychotherapists in private practices. The primary outcome is the severity of depression as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at completion of therapy. Secondary outcome measures include self-reported depressive and other symptoms, interpersonal functioning, idiosyncratic complaints, and the presence of the diagnosis of depression. Additional measures include biological measures, narrative material (sessions, interviews), and health care costs.Discussion: This trial presents the test of an often-described, yet hardly investigated interaction between important personality dimensions and therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression. Results could inform therapists on how to match psychotherapeutic treatments to specific personality characteristics of their patients.Trial Registration: Isrctn.com, ISRCTN17130982 .

        <ab>Background: NICE guidelines state cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a front-line psychological treatment for people presenting with depression in primary care. Counselling for Depression (CfD), a form of Person-Centred Experiential therapy, is also offered within Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services for moderate depression but its effectiveness for severe depression has not been investigated. A full-scale randomised controlled trial to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CfD is required.Methods: PRaCTICED is a two-arm, parallel group, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing CfD against CBT. It is embedded within the local IAPT service using a stepped care service delivery model where CBT and CfD are routinely offered at step 3. Trial inclusion criteria comprise patients aged 18 years or over, wishing to work on their depression, judged to require a step 3 intervention, and meeting an ICD-10 diagnosis of moderate or severe depression. Patients are randomised using a centralised, web-based system to CfD or CBT with each treatment being delivered up to a maximum 20 sessions. Both interventions are manualised with treatment fidelity tested via supervision and random sampling of sessions using adherence/competency scales. The primary outcome measure is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures tap depression, generic psychological distress, anxiety, functioning and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness is determined by a patient service receipt questionnaire. Exit interviews are conducted with patients by research assessors blind to treatment allocation. The trial requires 500 patients (250 per arm) to test the non-inferiority hypothesis of -2 PHQ-9 points at the one-sided, 2.5% significance level with 90% power, assuming no underlying difference and a standard deviation of 6.9. The primary analysis will be undertaken on all patients randomised (intent to treat) alongside per-protocol and complier-average causal effect analyses as recommended by the extension to the CONSORT statement for non-inferiority trials.Discussion: This large-scale trial utilises routinely collected outcome data as well as specific trial data to provide evidence of the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Counselling for Depression compared with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy as delivered within the UK government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies initiative.Trial Registration: Controlled Trials ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN06461651 .

        <ab>Background: Mental disorders are the leading global cause of years lived with disability; the majority of this burden exists in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Over half of mental illness is attributable to depression and anxiety disorders, both of which have known treatments. While the scarcity of mental health care providers is recognized as a major contributor to the magnitude of untreated disorders in LMICs, studies in LMICs find that evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety disorders, such as brief, structured psychotherapies, are feasible, acceptable and have strong efficacy when delivered by local non-specialist personnel. However, most mental health treatment studies using non-specialist providers in LMICs deploy traditional efficacy designs (T1) without the benefit of integrated mental health treatment models shown to succeed over vertical interventions or methods derived from new implementation science to speed policy change. Here, we describe an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study that evaluates non-specialist delivery of mental health treatment within an HIV clinic for HIV-positive (HIV+) women affected by gender- based violence (GBV) (HIV+ GBV+) in the Nyanza region of Kenya.Methods/design: In this effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I design, 200 HIV+ women with major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who are receiving care at a Family AIDS Care Education and Services (FACES)-supported clinic in Kisumu, Kenya will be randomized to: (1) interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) + treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) TAU, both delivered within the HIV clinic. IPT will consist of 12 weekly 60-minute individual IPT sessions, delivered by non-specialists trained to provide IPT. Primary effectiveness outcomes will include MDD and PTSD diagnosis on the Mini International Diagnostic Interview (MINI). Primary implementation outcomes will include treatment cost-benefit, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity of the IPT delivery within an HIV clinic.Discussion: This trial leverages newly defined effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs to gather data on mental health treatment implementation within an HIV care clinic, while testing the effectiveness of an evidence-based treatment for use with a large underserved population (HIV+ GBV+ women) in Kenya.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT02320799, registered on 9 September 2014.</ab>

        <ab>Background/purpose: This study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of psychological distress among incarcerated youth in Taiwan using the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5).Methods: This cross-sectional census survey study was conducted in 2007 among all the juveniles incarcerated in 23 correctional institutions (n = 1505) in Taiwan using a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Of the total 1505 participants, 1363 completed the questionnaire (91% response rate). We excluded 494 participants as they were aged either over 17 years or under 12 years. Psychological distress was measured among the final 869 participants using the BSRS-5. Psychological distress was defined as a total score of at least 6 out of 20. Those identified as having psychological distress were then pooled into a case group and compared with control participants without psychological distress.Results: The prevalence of psychological distress was 44.1%. Among the case group, sleep disturbance (36.8%) had the highest prevalence of severe or very severe symptoms, followed by depression (34.7%), and hostility (27.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that correlates of psychological distress included the following: being female; having a poor self-rated health status; having joined a gang; having experienced life disturbances prior to the current imprisonment; and having ever had a smoking habit.Conclusion: Significant sex differences were found for both the overall BSRS-5, as well as for each individual item of the BSRS-5. Treatment programs and interventions should be carefully tailored to address the mental health needs of juvenile inmates in a sex-specific manner using a multifaceted approach.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. To evaluate gender, age, and race/ethnicity as predictors of incident mental health diagnoses amongOperations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and New Dawn veterans. Methods. We used US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health records from 2001 to 2014 to examine incidence rates and sociodemographic risk factors for mental health diagnoses among 888 142 veterans. Results. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most frequently diagnosed mental health condition across gender and age groups. Incidence rates for all mental health diagnoses were highest at ages 18 to 29 years and declined thereafter, with the exceptions of major depressive disorder (MDD) in both genders, and PTSD among women. Risk of incident bipolar disorder and MDD diagnoses were greater among women; risk of incident schizophrenia, and alcohol- and drug-use disorders diagnoses were greater in men. Compared with Whites, risk incident PTSD, MDD, and alcohol-use disorder diagnoses were lower at ages 18 to 29 years and higher at ages 45 to 64 years for both Hispanics and African Americans. Conclusions. Differentiating high-risk demographic and gender groups can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of mental health diagnoses among veterans and other high-risk groups.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To determine mental health service utilization and barriers among female veterans, this study examined the prevalence of U.S. female veterans who identified the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as their main source of health care.Methods: This observational study used data from a nationally representative sample of 1,202 veterans who completed a Web-based survey. The analysis compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, mental health service use, and perceived barriers to mental health care among female veterans who do and do not use the VA as their main source of health care and male veterans who mainly use VA health care.Results: By gender, 23.4% of female veterans and 19.6% of male veterans identified the VA as their main source of health care, which was not significantly different. Compared with male VA patients, women were more likely to be single, younger, and from a racial-ethnic minority group and to screen positive for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but they were less likely to have a substance use disorder. Compared with female veterans who did not mainly use VA care, female VA patients were more likely to be on a low income, not employed, from racial-ethnic minority groups, and combat veterans, and they were more likely to have a disability, to screen positive for PTSD, and to report poorer mental health-related functioning. There were no group differences in mental health service use, and the most frequently endorsed barriers to using mental health care across veteran groups were "high treatment costs" and "being seen as weak."Conclusions: These findings highlight the health care needs of female VA service users and support efforts to dispel misconceptions and stigma related to mental health care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Antidepressant use continues to rise, mainly explained by an increase in the proportion of patients receiving long term treatment. Although treatment guidelines recommend discontinuation after sustained remission, discontinuing antidepressants appears to be challenging for both patients and general practitioners (GPs). Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an effective intervention that reduces the risk of relapse in recurrent depression and might facilitate discontinuation by teaching patients to cope with withdrawal symptoms and fear of relapse. The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the combination of Supported Protocolized Discontinuation (SPD) and MBCT in comparison with SPD alone in successful discontinuation of long-term use of antidepressants in primary care. Methods: This study involves a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in primary care patients with long-term use antidepressants with baseline and 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up assessments. Patients choosing to discontinue their medication will be offered a combination of SPD and MBCT or SPD alone. Our primary outcome will be full discontinuation of antidepressant medication (= 0 mg) within 6 months after baseline assessment. Secondary outcome measures will be the severity of withdrawal symptoms, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological well-being, quality of life and medical and societal costs. Discussion: In theory, stopping antidepressant medication seems straightforward. In practice however, patients and their GPs appear reluctant to initiate and accomplish this process. Both patients and professionals are in need of appropriate tools and information to better support the process of discontinuing antidepressant medication.

        <ab>Background: Depression, prevalent among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Malawi, is associated with negative HIV patient outcomes and likely affects HIV medical management. Despite the high prevalence of depression, its management has not been integrated into HIV care in Malawi or most low-income countries.Methods: This study employs a pre-post design in two HIV clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi, to evaluate the effect of integrating depression management into routine HIV care on both mental health and HIV outcomes. Using a multiple baseline design, this study is examining mental health and HIV outcome data of adult (≥18 years) patients newly initiating ART who also have depression, comparing those entering care before and after the integration of depression screening and treatment into HIV care. The study is also collecting cost information to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the program in improving rates of depression remission and HIV treatment engagement and success.Discussion: We anticipate that the study will generate evidence on the effect of depression management on HIV outcomes and the feasibility of integrating depression management into existing HIV care clinics. The results of the study will inform practice and policy decisions on integration of depression management in HIV care clinics in Malawi and related settings, and will help design a next-step strategy to scale-up integration to a larger scale.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID [ NCT03555669 ].

        <ab>Background: Depression is the leading cause of disability in young people (aged 15-25) globally. Loneliness is a major factor in the development and relapse of depression in young people, yet few interventions directly address loneliness. Groups 4 Health (G4H) - a novel, theoretically derived group psychotherapy intervention - may address this disconnect. Previous trials (Phase I and Phase II) have found G4H to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression. However, the efficacy of G4H compared to current evidence-based treatments (Phase III) has not been investigated. This protocol details the design and methodology of the Connecting Adolescents to Reduce Relapse (CARR) trial, a randomised control trial assessing the efficacy of G4H in young people relative to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).Methods: The CARR trial is a two-arm non-inferiority randomised controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of G4H to the most widely used evidence-based treatment for depression, CBT, at program completion and 6- and 12-month follow up. Participants will be 200 young people (aged 15-25) with symptoms of depression and/or loneliness recruited from community and university mental health services. We hypothesise that the interventions will be comparable in reducing depression symptoms, but that G4H will be superior in reducing loneliness. Because loneliness is a primary risk factor for depression relapse in young people, we therefore expect the benefits of Groups 4 Health to be particularly apparent at 12-month follow up.Discussion: This trial will be the first to evaluate an intervention that targets loneliness, in comparison to the current gold standard treatment approach - CBT. If found to be effective, this program offers a new approach to treatment and relapse prevention of depression among young people.Trial Registration: Trial prospectively registered on ANZCTR ( ACTRN12618000440224 ), registered on 27/03/2018.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Many youths receiving community mental health treatment do not receive evidence-based interventions. Research suggests that community mental health therapists use a broad range of therapeutic techniques at low intensities. This study examined the relationship between therapist- and client-level predictors of community-based therapists' report of cognitive, behavioral, psychodynamic, and family techniques within the context of implementation efforts.Methods: A total of 130 therapists participated from 23 organizations in an urban, publicly funded behavioral health system implementing evidence-based practices. Therapist-level predictors included age, gender, clinical experience, licensure status, and participation in evidence-based practice initiatives. Child-level predictors included therapist-reported child primary disorder (externalizing, internalizing, or other) and child age. Therapists completed the Therapist Procedures Checklist-Family Revised, a self-report measure of therapeutic techniques used.Results: Unlicensed therapists were more likely than licensed therapists to report using psychodynamic and behavioral techniques. Therapists who did not participate in an evidence-based practice initiative were less likely to report use of cognitive techniques. Those with clients with externalizing disorders were more likely to report use of behavioral and family techniques. Therapists with the youngest clients (ages three to seven years) were most likely to report use of behavioral techniques and less likely to report use of cognitive and psychodynamic techniques.Conclusions: Results suggest that both therapist and client factors predict self-reported use of therapy techniques. Participating in an evidence-based practice initiative was associated with increased reports of using cognitive techniques. Therapists reported using behavioral and family techniques more than other techniques when working with youths with externalizing disorders and using fewer cognitive and psychodynamic techniques with young clients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a stressful condition. Mental health comorbidity is common. Stress can increase the risk of depression, reduce quality of life (QOL), and possibly exacerbate disease activity in MS. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may help, but has been little studied in MS, particularly among more disabled individuals.Methods: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and likely effectiveness of a standard MBSR course for people with MS. Participant eligibility included: age &gt; 18, any type of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) &lt;/= 7.0. Participants received either MBSR or wait-list control. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months later. Primary outcomes were perceived stress and QOL. Secondary outcomes were common MS symptoms, mindfulness, and self-compassion.Results: Fifty participants were recruited and randomised (25 per group). Trial retention and outcome measure completion rates were 90% at post-intervention, and 88% at 3 months. Sixty percent of participants completed the course. Immediately post-MBSR, perceived stress improved with a large effect size (ES 0.93; p &lt; 0.01), compared to very small beneficial effects on QOL (ES 0.17; p = 0.48). Depression (ES 1.35; p &lt; 0.05), positive affect (ES 0.87; p = 0.13), anxiety (ES 0.85; p = 0.05), and self-compassion (ES 0.80; p &lt; 0.01) also improved with large effect sizes. At three-months post-MBSR (study endpoint) improvements in perceived stress were diminished to a small effect size (ES 0.26; p = 0.39), were negligible for QOL (ES 0.08; p = 0.71), but were large for mindfulness (ES 1.13; p &lt; 0.001), positive affect (ES 0.90; p = 0.54), self-compassion (ES 0.83; p &lt; 0.05), anxiety (ES 0.82; p = 0.15), and prospective memory (ES 0.81; p &lt; 0.05).Conclusions: Recruitment, retention, and data collection demonstrate that a RCT of MBSR is feasible for people with MS. Trends towards improved outcomes suggest that a larger definitive RCT may be warranted. However, optimisation changes may be required to render more stable the beneficial treatment effects on stress and depression.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02136485 ; trial registered 1st May 2014.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In recent years, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of depression. In addition, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a member of the purinergic receptor family, which is predominantly present on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and neurons in lesser amounts in the central nervous system, was suggested to be involved in the processing and releasing of IL-1β. Here, we investigated the role of P2X7R in the pathogenesis of depression.Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable stressors (CUS) for 3 weeks. At the end of week 1, 2, and 3, extracellular ATP, caspase 1, IL-1β, and components and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain containing 3) were evaluated as biomarker of neuroinflammation. In separate experiments, the rats were microinjected with P2X7R agonists ATP, BzATP, and saline into the hippocampus, respectively, or exposed to CUS combined with hippocampal microinjection with P2X7R antagonist, BBG and A438079, and saline, respectively, for 3 weeks, followed by exposed to forced swimming test and open-field test. Moreover, we also evaluated the depressive and anxiety-like behavior of P2X7-null mice in forced swimming test, open-field test, and elevated plus maze.Results: Along with stress accumulation, extracellular ATP, cleaved-caspase 1, IL-1β, and ASC were significantly enhanced in the hippocampus, but P2X7R and NLRP3 were not. Immunoprecipitation assay indicated that along with the accumulation of stress, assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and cleaved caspase 1 in NLRP3 inflammasome were significantly increased. Moreover, antagonists of P2X7R, either BBG or A438079, prevented the development of depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable stress in rats. Meanwhile, we could not observe any depressive-like or anxiety-like behaviors of P2X7-null mice after they had been exposed to CUS. The results implied that P2X7 knockout could impede the development of depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors induced by CUS. In contrast, chronic administration of agonists of P2X7R, either ATP or BzATP, could induce depressive-like behaviors.Conclusions: The activation of P2X7R and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome in hippocampal microglial cells could mediate depressive-like behaviors, which suggests a new therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Physician follow-up after a first diagnosis of psychotic disorder is crucial for improving treatment engagement. We examined the factors associated with physician follow-up within 30 days of a first diagnosis of schizophrenia.Method: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked health administrative data to identify incident cases of schizophrenia between 1999 and 2008 among people aged 14 to 35 years in Ontario. We estimated the proportion of patients who had physician follow-up within 30 days of the index diagnosis. We used multilevel logistic regression models to examine the factors associated with any physician follow-up and follow-up by a psychiatrist.Results: We identified 20,096 people with a first diagnosis of schizophrenia. Approximately 40% of people did not receive any physician follow-up within 30 days, and nearly 60% did not receive follow-up by a psychiatrist. Males had lower odds of receiving any physician follow-up, and the odds of psychiatrist follow-up decreased with increasing age and were lower for those living in rural areas. Both prior contact with a general practitioner for a mental health reason and prior contact with a psychiatrist were strongly associated with higher odds of receiving both types of follow-up.Conclusions: Many people do not have any physician contact within 30 days of the first diagnosis of schizophrenia, and patients without prior engagement with mental health services are at highest risk. We need information on the reasons behind this lack of physician follow-up to inform strategies aimed at improving engagement with services during the early stages of psychosis.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Le suivi d'un médecin après un premier diagnostic de trouble psychotique est essentiel pour améliorer l'engagement au traitement. Nous avons examiné les facteurs associés au suivi du médecin dans les 30 jours suivant un premier diagnostic de schizophrénie. Méthode : Nous avons mené une étude de cohorte rétrospective à l'aide de données de santé administratives couplées pour identifier les cas incidents de schizophrénie entre 1999 et 2008 chez les personnes de 14 à 35 ans, en Ontario. Nous avons estimé la proportion des patients qui ont eu un suivi du médecin dans les 30 jours suivant le premier diagnostic. Nous avonsutilisé des modèles de régression logistique multiniveaux pour examiner les facteurs associés à un suivi par n'importe quel médecin et à un suivi par un psychiatre. Résultats : Nous avons identifié 20 096 personnes ayant reçu un premier diagnostic de schizophrénie. Environ 40% de ces personnes n'ont reçu aucun suivi d'un médecin dans les 30 jours, et près de 60% n'ont pas reçu de suivi d'un psychiatre. Les hommes avaient de plus faibles probabilités de recevoir un suivi par n'importe quel médecin, et les probabilités d'un suivi par un psychiatre diminuaient plus l'âge augmentait, et étaient plus faibles pour ceux habitant en région rurale. Tant le contact précédent avec un omnipraticien pour une raison de santé mentale que le contact précédent avec un psychiatre étaient fortement associés avec des probabilités plus élevées de recevoir les deux types de suivi. Conclusions : De nombreuses personnes n'ont aucun contact avec un médecin dans les 30 jours suivant le premier diagnostic de schizophrénie, et les patients sans engagement précédent avec les services de santé mentale sont à risque plus élevé. Il nous faut de l'information sur les raisons de ce manque de suivi d'un médecin pour éclairer les stratégies visant à améliorer l'engagement aux services durant les premières phases de la psychose.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundThe influence of baseline severity has been examined for antidepressant medications but has not been studied properly for cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in comparison with pill placebo.AimsTo synthesise evidence regarding the influence of initial severity on efficacy of CBT from all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which CBT, in face-to-face individual or group format, was compared with pill-placebo control in adults with major depression.MethodA systematic review and an individual-participant data meta-analysis using mixed models that included trial effects as random effects. We used multiple imputation to handle missing data.ResultsWe identified five RCTs, and we were given access to individual-level data (n = 509) for all five. The analyses revealed that the difference in changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression between CBT and pill placebo was not influenced by baseline severity (interaction P = 0.43). Removing the non-significant interaction term from the model, the difference between CBT and pill placebo was a standardised mean difference of -0.22 (95% CI -0.42 to -0.02, P = 0.03, I2 = 0%).ConclusionsPatients suffering from major depression can expect as much benefit from CBT across the wide range of baseline severity. This finding can help inform individualised treatment decisions by patients and their clinicians.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Child and youth mental health problems are leading causes of disability and particular problems in low- and middle-income countries where populations are young and child mental health services are in short supply. Collaborative care models that support primary care providers' efforts to detect and treat child mental health problems offer one way to address this need. However, collaborative care for child mental health can be more complex than collaboration for adults for a number of reasons, including two-generational aspects of care, high degrees of co-morbidity, and variations in presentation across developmental stages.Methods: The study takes advantage of an existing collaborative care network in Tehran, Iran, in which general practitioners are supported by community mental health centers to care for adult mental health problems. At present, those practitioners are asked to refer children with mental health problems to the collaborating centers rather than treating them themselves. We are conducting a cluster randomized trial in which practitioners in the network will be randomized to receive training in child/youth mental health treatment or a booster training on recognition and referral. Children/youth aged 5-15 years making visits to the practitioners will be screened using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; those found positive will be followed for six months to compare outcomes between those treated by trained or control practitioners.Discussion: If the trial demonstrates superior outcomes among children treated by trained practitioners, it will support the feasibility of expanding collaborative care networks to include children.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03144739 .

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Depression is a common comorbidity of diabetes, undesirably affecting patients' physical and mental functioning. Psychological interventions are effective treatments for depression in the general population as well as in patients with a chronic disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of individual mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in comparison with a waiting-list control condition for treating depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 94 outpatients with diabetes and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II] &gt;=14) were randomized to MBCT (n = 31), CBT (n = 32), or waiting list (n = 31). All participants completed written questionnaires and interviews at pre- and postmeasurement (3 months later). Primary outcome measure was severity of depressive symptoms (BDI-II and Toronto Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), well-being (Well-Being Index), diabetes-related distress (Problem Areas In Diabetes), and HbA1c levels were assessed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Results showed that participants receiving MBCT and CBT reported significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared with patients in the waiting-list control condition (respectively, P = 0.004 and P &lt; 0.001; d = 0.80 and 1.00; clinically relevant improvement 26% and 29% vs. 4%). Both interventions also had significant positive effects on anxiety, well-being, and diabetes-related distress. No significant effect was found on HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Both individual MBCT and CBT are effective in improving a range of psychological symptoms in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The purpose was to test the effectiveness of two transdiagnostic group interventions compared to care as usual (CAU) for patients with anxiety, depressive or stress-related disorders within a primary health care context.Objectives: To compare the effects of cognitive-based-behavioural therapy (CBT) and multimodal intervention (MMI) on the quality of life and relief of psychological symptoms of patients with common mental disorders or problems attending primary health care centre.Methods: Patients (n = 278), aged 18-65 years, were referred to the study by the GPs and 245 were randomized to CAU or one of two group interventions in addition to CAU: (i) group CBT administered by psychologists and (ii) group MMI administered by assistant nurses. The primary outcome measure was the Mental Component Summary score of short form 36. Secondary outcome measures were Perceived Stress Scale and Self-Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes. The data were analysed using intention-to-treat with a linear mixed model.Results: On the primary outcome measure, the mean improvement based on mixed model analyses across post- and follow-up assessment was significantly larger for the MMI group than for the CBT (4.0; P = 0.020) and CAU (7.5; P = .001) groups. Participants receiving CBT were significantly more improved than those in the CAU group. On four of the secondary outcome measures, the MMI group was significantly more improved than the CBT and CAU groups. The course of improvement did not differ between the CBT group and the CAU group on these measures.Conclusions: Transdiagnostic group treatment can be effective for patients with common mental disorders when delivered in a primary care setting. The group format and transdiagnostic approach fit well with the requirements of primary care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Many people with mental distress are disadvantaged because care is not available or does not address their needs. In order to increase access to high quality primary mental health care for under-served groups, we created a model of care with three discrete elements: community engagement, primary care training and tailored wellbeing interventions. We have previously demonstrated the individual impact of each element of the model. Here we assess the effectiveness of the combined model in increasing access to and improving the quality of primary mental health care. We test the assumptions that access to the wellbeing interventions is increased by the presence of community engagement and primary care training; and that quality of primary mental health care is increased by the presence of community engagement and the wellbeing interventions.Methods: We implemented the model in four under-served localities in North-West England, focusing on older people and minority ethnic populations. Using a quasi-experimental design with no-intervention comparators, we gathered a combination of quantitative and qualitative information. Quantitative information, including referral and recruitment rates for the wellbeing interventions, and practice referrals to mental health services, was analysed descriptively. Qualitative information derived from interview and focus group responses to topic guides from more than 110 participants. Framework analysis was used to generate findings from the qualitative data.Results: Access to the wellbeing interventions was associated with the presence of the community engagement and the primary care training elements. Referrals to the wellbeing interventions were associated with community engagement, while recruitment was associated with primary care training. Qualitative data suggested that the mechanisms underlying these associations were increased awareness and sense of agency. The quality of primary mental health care was enhanced by information gained from our community mapping activities, and by the offer of access to the wellbeing interventions. There were variable benefits from health practitioner participation in community consultative groups. We also found that participation in the wellbeing interventions led to increased community engagement.Conclusions: We explored the interactions between elements of a multilevel intervention and identified important associations and underlying mechanisms. Further research is needed to test the generalisability of the model.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials, reference ISRCTN68572159 . Registered 25 February 2013.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Major depression is one of the most debilitating diseases in terms of quality of life. Less than half of patients suffering from depression can achieve remission after adequate antidepressant treatment. Another promising treatment option is cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). However, the need for experienced therapists and substantive dedicated time prevent CBT from being widely disseminated. In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the same time, in comparison to switching antidepressants only, among patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment.Methods/design: A multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted since September 2014. The smartphone-based CBT program, named the "Kokoro-App," for major depression has been developed and its feasibility has been confirmed in a previous open study. The program consists of an introduction, 6 sessions and an epilogue, and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks by patients. In the present trial, 164 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder and still suffering from depressive symptoms after adequate antidepressant treatment for more than 4 weeks will be allocated to the Kokoro-App plus switching antidepressant group or the switching antidepressant alone group. The participants allocated to the latter group will receive full components of the Kokoro-App after 9 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire through the 9 weeks of the program, as assessed at week 0, 1, 5 and 9 via telephone by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes include the change in the total score of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, change in side effects as assessed by the Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating, and treatment satisfaction.Discussion: An effective and reachable intervention may not only lead to healthier mental status among depressed patients, but also to reduced social burden from this illness. This paper outlines the background and methods of a trial that evaluates the possible additive value of a smartphone-based CBT program for treatment-resistant depression.Trial Registration: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000013693 (registered on 1 June 2014).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) is an emergent research topic in the field of mental health care and is considered to be a central component of a recovery-oriented system. Despite the evidence suggesting the benefits of this change in the power relationship between users and practitioners, the method has not been widely implemented in clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate decisional and information needs among users with mental illness as a prerequisite for the development of a decision support tool aimed at supporting SDM in community-based mental health services in Sweden. Methods: Three semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 22 adult users with mental illness. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using a directed content analysis. This method was used to develop an in-depth understanding of the decisional process as well as to validate and conceptually extend Elwyn et al.'s model of SDM. Results: The model Elwyn et al. have created for SDM in somatic care fits well for mental health services, both in terms of process and content. However, the results also suggest an extension of the model because decisions related to mental illness are often complex and involve a number of life domains. Issues related to social context and individual recovery point to the need for a preparation phase focused on establishing cooperation and mutual understanding as well as a clear follow-up phase that allows for feedback and adjustments to the decision-making process. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The current study contributes to a deeper understanding of decisional and information needs among users of community-based mental health services that may reduce barriers to participation in decision-making. The results also shed light on attitudinal, relationship-based, and cognitive factors that are important to consider in adapting SDM in the mental health system.</ab>

        <ab>It is increasingly recognised that single-case analysis makes a valuable contribution to the evidence base for psychotherapy, alongside other methodologies. Such analyses make it possible to investigate the unfolding process of change in therapy, and develop an understanding of change factors that contribute to outcome. One of the key challenges for the psychotherapy research community is to develop methods for descriptive single-case analysis that are simple to apply, and allow comparison across cases collected in different contexts. Topic Change Process Analysis represents a practice-relevant framework that is descriptive, flexible and widely applicable. The present paper presents an analysis of brief integrative/eclectic therapy received by a young woman struggling to come to terms with emotional instability and depressive episodes. Analysis of topic areas, topic shifts, response patterns within topics and changes in perspective makes it possible to identify key processes which resulted in a positive outcome for this client. The implications of these findings for practice, and future research, are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Residual symptoms and cognitive impairment are among important sources of disability in patients with bipolar disorder. Methylene blue could improve such symptoms because of its potential neuroprotective effects.Aims: We conducted a double-blind crossover study of a low dose (15 mg, 'placebo') and an active dose (195 mg) of methylene blue in patients with bipolar disorder treated with lamotrigine.Method: Thirty-seven participants were enrolled in a 6-month trial (trial registration: NCT00214877). The outcome measures included severity of depression, mania and anxiety, and cognitive functioning.Results: The active dose of methylene blue significantly improved symptoms of depression both on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (P = 0.02 and 0.05 in last-observation-carried-forward analysis). It also reduced the symptoms of anxiety measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (P = 0.02). The symptoms of mania remained low and stable throughout the study. The effects of methylene blue on cognitive symptoms were not significant. The medication was well tolerated with transient and mild side-effects.Conclusions: Methylene blue used as an adjunctive medication improved residual symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Nonprofessional caregivers are highly important in the everyday life of patients with depression. Yet, they may experience increased levels of burden, stress, depression, and anxiety. Therefore, there is a need for interventions that relieve symptoms and are accessible and time-efficient. This paper describes the protocol of a pilot study to evaluate (1) the feasibility of an online self-management intervention, E-care 4 caregivers, for the nonprofessional caregiver of patients with depression, and (2) the initial effects of E-care 4 caregivers on psychological distress, subjective burden, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life.Methods/design: The study is a randomized controlled trial in which we are comparing the E-care 4 caregivers online intervention with a wait list control group. Eighty-four nonprofessional caregivers of patients with depression aged 18 years or older are being recruited from among the general population. Feasibility is determined by semistructured telephone interviews evaluating the subjects' satisfaction with the intervention and by using a questionnaire on the user-friendliness of the system. The primary outcome measure used to examine the initial effects of the intervention is psychological distress. Secondary outcome measures are subjective burden, symptoms of anxiety and depression, level of mastery, and quality of life. Assessments will be done at baseline and 6 weeks later. Statistical analysis of the effects of the intervention will be carried out on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle.Discussion: E-care 4 caregivers could potentially benefit nonprofessional caregivers, as well as patients and professionals indirectly.Trial Registration: Netherlands Trial Register identifier: NTR5268 .

        <ab>The pediatric practitioner is often the first point-of-contact for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness. Part of the treatment planning for psychiatric diagnoses includes consideration of medication. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, one of the most common diagnoses, is very responsive to stimulant medications; for children who are unable to tolerate stimulants or who do not achieve satisfactory symptom management, central α-agonists and atomoxetine are effective and generally well-tolerated alternative or augmentative agents. Depression and anxiety disorders are also frequently encountered in the pediatric office setting. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is considered first-line psychopharmacology for depression and anxiety symptoms. Despite concerns for suicidal ideation related to this medication class, the benefits typically outweigh the risks. This review provides basic clinical pharmacology of stimulant and nonstimulant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors intended to serve as a primer for the general pediatrician.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: We conducted comprehensive assessments of emotional distress to examine relations with diabetes medication adherence over time.Research Design and Methods: Ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adults treated for type 2 diabetes completed validated self-reports (SRs) for diabetes distress and depression, were administered semistructured depression interviews, and provided blood samples for A1C. Medication adherence among 104 participants was electronically monitored (EM) over the subsequent 3 months; validated SRs of medication adherence were also obtained. Hierarchical linear regression evaluated independent effects of diabetes distress and depression on adherence.Results: Mean ± SD 3-month medication adherence was 76.1% ± 25.7% for EM and 83.7% ± 21.9% for SR. Higher levels of SR (P &lt; 0.001) and interview-based (P &lt; 0.05) depressive symptom severity (P &lt; 0.05) and diabetes-related distress (P &lt; 0.01) showed a significant bivariate association with EM and SR nonadherence. Regression models showed baseline diabetes distress was a significant independent predictor of EM (β = -0.29; P = 0.001) and SR adherence (β = -0.24; P &lt; 0.02) at follow-up. SR depression was an independent predictor of EM and SR adherence and reduced the effects of diabetes distress to nonsignificance. Subsequent models indicated this effect was driven by somatic rather than cognitive-affective symptoms of depression. Results were consistent but weaker for interview-based depressive symptoms.Conclusions: Findings support diabetes-related distress and depression symptom severity as risk factors for type 2 diabetes medication nonadherence. Somatic symptoms captured by depression measures, but not cognitive-affective symptoms, independently predict nonadherence and should be further investigated as a potential link between emotional distress and nonadherence.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Broadly disseminating and implementing evidence-based psychotherapies with high fidelity, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has proved challenging for many health-care systems, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially in primary care settings such as small or remote clinics. A computer-based tool (based on the coordinated anxiety learning and management (CALM) program) was designed to support primary care-based mental health providers in delivering CBT. The objectives of this study are to modify the CALM tool to meet the needs of mental health clinicians in veterans affairs (VA) community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) and rural "veterans", use external facilitation to implement CBT and determine the effect of the CALM tool versus a manualized version of CALM to improve fidelity to the CBT treatment model, and conduct a needs assessment to understand how best to support future implementation of the CALM tool in routine care.Methods/design: Focus groups will inform the redesign of the CALM tool. Mental health providers at regional VA CBOCs; CBT experts; VA experts in implementation of evidence-based mental health practices; and veterans with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, "with or without" depression will be recruited. A hybrid type III design will be used to examine the effect of receiving CBT training plus either the CALM tool or a manual version of CALM on treatment fidelity. External facilitation will be used as the overarching strategy to implement both CBT delivery methods. Data will also be collected on symptoms of the targeted disorders. To help prepare for the future implementation of the CALM tool in VA CBOCs, we will perform an implementation need assessment with mental health providers participating in the clinical trial and their CBOC directors.Discussion: This project will help inform strategies for delivering CBT with high fidelity in VA CBOCs to veterans with anxiety disorders and PTSD with or without depression. If successful, results of this study could be used to inform a national rollout of the CALM tool in VA CBOCs including providing recommendations for optimizing the adoption and sustained use of the computerized CALM tool among mental health providers in this setting.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02488551.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Effective, accessible, and affordable depression treatment is of high importance considering the large personal and economic burden of depression. Internet-based treatment is considered a promising clinical and cost-effective alternative to current routine depression treatment strategies such as face-to-face psychotherapy. However, it is not clear whether research findings translate to routine clinical practice such as primary or specialized mental health care. The E-COMPARED project aims to gain knowledge on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended depression treatment compared to treatment-as-usual in routine care.Methods/design: E-COMPARED will employ a pragmatic, multinational, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial in eight European countries. Adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited in primary care (Germany, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) or specialized mental health care (France, The Netherlands, and Switzerland). Regular care for depression is compared to "blended" service delivery combining mobile and Internet technologies with face-to-face treatment in one treatment protocol. Participants will be followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline to determine clinical improvements in symptoms of depression (primary outcome: Patient Health Questionnaire-9), remission of depression, and cost-effectiveness. Main analyses will be conducted on the pooled data from the eight countries (n = 1200 in total, 150 participants in each country).Discussion: The E-COMPARED project will provide mental health care stakeholders with evidence-based information and recommendations on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended depression treatment.Trial Registration: France: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02542891 .

        <ab>Background To estimate the association between exposures to psychosocial risks and risk of minor psychiatric disorder (MPDR) among the working population of Catalonia in 2010, by gender and occupational class. Methods The analysis is based on a sample, corresponding to the year 2010, of workers in Catalonia (n = 2741). We calculated the prevalence [and 95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of MPDR, stratifying by occupational class, age and sex, and by the different psychosocial exposures. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated between MPDR and the different psychosocial exposures using Poisson regression modelling with robust variance estimates. Results The main results show that the prevalence of MPDR was ~12.3% (95% CI: 10.8; 13.8), being higher in women than in men (15.1 and 9.7%, respectively). Workers exposed to each of the various psychosocial dimensions, except for low Control and Double Presence, present significantly higher prevalences of MPDR than non-exposed workers. Differences in terms of gender and occupational class were glimpsed. Conclusion These results highlight the important contribution of psychosocial risk exposures to the MPDR among the working population, and consequently that there is a need to improve workplace psychosocial environments.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The integration of maternal mental health into primary health care has been advocated to reduce the mental health treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study reports findings of a cross-country situation analysis on maternal mental health and services available in five LMICs, to inform the development of integrated maternal mental health services integrated into primary health care.Methods: The situation analysis was conducted in five districts in Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda, as part of the Programme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME). The analysis reports secondary data on the prevalence and impact of priority maternal mental disorders (perinatal depression, alcohol use disorders during pregnancy and puerperal psychosis), existing policies, plans and services for maternal mental health, and other relevant contextual factors, such as explanatory models for mental illness.Results: Limited data were available at the district level, although generalizable data from other sites was identified in most cases. Community and facility-based prevalences ranged widely across PRIME countries for perinatal depression (3-50 %) and alcohol consumption during pregnancy (5-51 %). Maternal mental health was included in mental health policies in South Africa, India and Ethiopia, and a mental health care plan was in the process of being implemented in South Africa. No district reported dedicated maternal mental health services, but referrals to specialised care in psychiatric units or general hospitals were possible. No information was available on coverage for maternal mental health care. Challenges to the provision of maternal mental health care included; limited evidence on feasible detection and treatment strategies for maternal mental disorders, lack of mental health specialists in the public health sector, lack of prescribing guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and stigmatising attitudes among primary health care staff and the community.Conclusions: It is difficult to anticipate demand for mental health care at district level in the five countries, given the lack of evidence on the prevalence and treatment coverage of women with maternal mental disorders. Limited evidence on effective psychosocial interventions was also noted, and must be addressed for mental health programmes, such as PRIME, to implement feasible and effective services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study aimed to determine whether a self-management support service was more effective than treatment as usual in reducing depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes and increasing personal recovery among individuals with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms.Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial of a self-management support service consisting of depression self-management training, recovery coaching, and care coordination. The 18-month intervention included regular telephone or in-person contacts with a care manager and a structured group program co-led by a professional therapist and a trained peer specialist. Intervention (N=150) and control (N=152) participants ages ≥ 18 with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms were recruited from five clinics in Seattle, Washington. Outcome measures included the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale, the Recovery Assessment Scale, the Patient-Rated Global Improvement scale, and the percentage of participants with a major depressive episode. Interviewers were masked to treatment condition.Results: Repeated-measures estimates of the long-term effect of the intervention versus usual care (average of the six-, 12-, and 18-month outcomes adjusted for age, gender, and site) indicated that intervention participants had less severe symptoms (p=.002) and higher recovery scores (p=.03), were less likely to be depressed (odds ratio [OR]=.52, p=.001), and were more likely to be much improved (OR=1.96, p=.001).Conclusions: These findings support providing regular outreach care management and a self-care group offering a combined behavioral and recovery-oriented approach for people with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) constitutes a serious and debilitating problem. Approximately one in five patients will develop significant depression following ACS and less severe depressive symptoms are even more frequent. Furthermore, anxiety symptoms and sleep-wake disturbances are frequent. The objective of the MEDACIS trial is to investigate whether prophylactic treatment with melatonin has a preventive effect on depression, depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep, and circadian disturbances following ACS.Methods/design: "The effect of MElatonin and Depressive symptoms, Anxiety, CIrcadian and Sleep disturbances in patients after acute coronary syndrome" trial (MEDACIS) is a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A total of 240 patients with ACS and no depressive symptoms will be included in the trial for treatment with either 25 mg melatonin or placebo for a 12-week period. Development and severity of depressive symptoms will be evaluated using Major Depression Inventory every 2 weeks with the purpose of investigating the potential preventive effect of melatonin on depressive symptoms.Discussion: Previously, only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been investigated in a primary preventive setup in patients following ACS. However, SSRIs are associated with several side effects. An ideal intervention would constitute the highest degree of prevention of depressive symptoms with the lowest risk of side effects. In this regard, melatonin may have advantages due to its low toxicity as well as its proven anxiolytic and hypnotic effects.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02451293 .

        <ab>Objective: This study investigated whether higher attendance in a skills-based group therapy program designed for inmates was associated with fewer rule infractions as reflected in the number of disciplinary reports received in a state correctional system.Methods: Administrative data were provided by the Connecticut Department of Correction and Correctional Managed Health Care at UConn Health, the system's health care organization. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of START NOW program participation events from 2010 through 2013 (N=946). Participants were adult male and female inmates, both sentenced and unsentenced, with and without recorded psychiatric diagnoses. The number of disciplinary reports was documented for up to six months after program participation. Incident rate ratios are presented from zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Predictive margins examined variation in the effect of sessions attended on disciplinary reports in the postprogram period across security risk groups and primary psychiatric diagnosis groups.Results: For each additional session of START NOW completed, a 5% reduction was noted in the incident rate of disciplinary reports. The effect of program participation was robust to all model considerations. Inmates with higher overall security scores appear to benefit most from program participation. The program was also found to be effective across primary psychiatric diagnosis classifications.Conclusions: START NOW was shown to be an effective treatment option for reducing disciplinary infractions by inmates.</ab>

        <ab>Study Question: Does mode of conception [spontaneous/after infertility treatment (IT)], type of pregnancy (singleton/twin) and parent gender have an effect on anxiety and depression levels and trajectories during pregnancy and the post-partum period?Summary Answer: Conception after IT was associated with a transitory increase in anxiety during the perinatal period for parents of singletons, while for IT parents of twins higher levels of psychopathological symptoms tended to persist during pregnancy and the post-partum period.What Is Known Already: Most previous studies have shown that successful IT is not associated with poor psychological well-being during pregnancy and the post-partum period, but there is also some evidence for heightened pregnancy-related anxiety, lower self-esteem and lower self-efficacy. Parents of twins experience increased postnatal anxiety and depression.Study Design, Size, Duration: This prospective longitudinal study assessed 267 couples (N = 534) at each trimester of pregnancy, after childbirth and at 3 months post-partum.Participants/materials, Setting, Method: The sample comprised 36 couples who had conceived after IT (19 twin pairs and 17 singletons) and 231 couples who had conceived spontaneously (SC; 28 twin pairs and 203 singletons). Couples were recruited at four public hospitals in Portugal, and self-report measures of anxiety and depression symptoms were administered.Main Results and the Role Of Chance: IT parents reported higher anxiety after childbirth than parents who SC, regardless of pregnancy type. IT parents of twins showed higher anxiety at mid-pregnancy, as well as higher anxiety and depression at 3 months post-partum than IT parents of singletons. Among IT mothers, those who had twins exhibited higher depression after childbirth than those who had singletons. Differences according to mode of conception, pregnancy type and parents gender over time were also noted. During pregnancy, IT parents of twins showed no significant change in depression scores, while the other groups depression scores statistically significantly decreased over time. From pregnancy to the post-partum period, (i) IT parents showed an increase in anxiety scores, whereas SC parents exhibited no changes in anxiety scores; (ii) IT women exhibited an increase in depression scores, while SC women depression scores decreased. During the post-partum period, IT and SC parents of twins showed no changes in anxiety scores, while IT and SC parents of singletons anxiety scores declined.Limitations, Reasons For Caution: Due to the small number of IT couples, the interpretation and generalization of the results should be done with caution.Wider Implications Of the Findings: The adverse impact of IT on psychopathological symptoms depends mostly on time and type of pregnancy, and is greater for twin pregnancies. These findings are important for tailoring interventions that address parents' specific needs at different moments.Study Funding/competing Interests: This work was supported by a grant (SFRH/BD/40146/2007) to the first author from the FCT, Foundation for Science and Technology (Portuguese Ministry of Education and Science), by the Operational Program Science and Innovation 2010 (POCI 2010) of the Community Support Board III, by FEDER Funds through the Operational Competitiveness Programme, COMPETE, and through national funding from the FCT under the projects: POCI/SAU-ESP/ 56397/2004 and PTDC/SAU/SAP/116738/2010.

        <ab>Objective: The influence of employment on subsequent psychiatric hospitalization for people with serious mental illness is unclear. This study examined whether unemployed people with serious mental illness were more or less likely to experience psychiatric hospitalization after gaining employment.Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted of data from the Mental Health Treatment Study. Two years of prospective employment and psychiatric hospital outcomes were examined for 2,055 adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. The analyses examined associations between employment and psychiatric hospitalization via multilevel regression by using time-lagged modeling.Results: Employment was associated with a lower subsequent three-month risk of psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratio=.65, 95% confidence interval=.50-.84) after the analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics, including previous psychiatric hospitalizations and self-reported physical health.Conclusions: Unemployed outpatients with serious mental illness were less likely to experience psychiatric hospitalization after gaining employment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is of major public health concern globally, with majority of patients living in Africa. Despite its relevance, there is a dearth of research to determine the socio-demographic distribution and psychosocial impact of SCD in Ghana. The objective of this study was to examine the socio-demographic distribution and psychosocial consequences of SCD among patients in Ghana and to assess their quality of life and coping mechanisms.Methods: A cross-sectional research design was used that involved the completion of questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, quality of life, coping mechanisms, anxiety and depression. Participants were 387 male and female patients attending a sickle cell clinic in a public hospital.Results: Results showed that majority of the patients were single, female, less than 39 years old and had attained secondary school level of education or less. Also, patients were more satisfied by the presence of love, friends and relatives as well as home, community and neighbourhood environment. While pains of varied nature and severity were the major reasons for attending hospital in SCD condition, going to the hospital as well as having faith in God was the most frequently reported mechanisms for coping with an unbearable SCD attacks. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that some socio-demographic and quality of life indicators had strong associations with anxiety and/or depression.Conclusions: It is recommended that a holistic intervention strategy incorporating psychosocial dimensions should be considered in the treatment and management of SCD.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship of depression at antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation with mortality and clinical outcomes among Tanzanian women living with HIV.Design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1487 women who initiated ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.Methods: Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed using a Tanzanian-adapted and validated version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Participants attended monthly clinic visits during the first 2 years of ART and CD4 T-cell counts were assessed every 4 months. Proportional hazard models were used to assess the relationship of depression with mortality and clinical outcomes.Results: Symptoms consistent with depression were prevalent among 57.8% of women at ART initiation. After multivariate adjustment, including social support and stigma, depression at ART initiation was associated with increased risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-3.20; P = 0.01] and incidence of severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dl; HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.07-2.37; P = 0.02). Under the assumption of causality, we estimate 36.1% (95% CI: 13.6-55.1%) of deaths among the study cohort were attributable to depression and its consequences. Depression was not significantly associated with trajectory of CD4 T-cell reconstitution or the risk of immunologic failure (P values &gt;0.05).Conclusion: Elimination of depression may reduce mortality during the first 2 years of ART by one-third in our study cohort. Randomized trials and rigorous implementation studies are needed to evaluate the individual and population-level effects of integrated mental health interventions and HIV treatment approaches in resource-limited settings.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The limitations of the DSM nosology for capturing dimensionality and overlap in psychiatric syndromes, and its poor correspondence to underlying neurobiology, have been well established. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a proposed dimensional model of psychopathology, may offer new insights into psychiatric illness. For psychiatric clinicians, however, because tools for capturing these domains in clinical practice have not yet been established, the relevance and means of transition from the categorical system of DSM-5 to the dimensional models of RDoC remains unclear. The authors explored a method of extracting these dimensions from existing electronic health record (EHR) notes. METHOD: The authors used information retrieval and natural language processing methods to extract estimates of the RDoC dimensions in the EHRs of a large health system. They parsed and scored EHR documentation for 2,484 admissions covering 2,010 patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 2011 and 2013. These domain scores were compared with DSM-IV-based ICD-9 codes to assess face validity. As a measure of predictive validity, these scores were examined for association with two outcomes: length of hospital stay and time to all-cause hospital readmission. Together, these analyses were intended to address the extent to which RDoC symptom domains might capture clinical features already available in narrative notes but not reflected in DSM diagnoses. RESULTS: In mixed-effects models, loadings for the RDoC cognitive and arousal domains were associated with length of hospital stay, while the negative valence and social domains were associated with hazard of all-cause hospital readmission. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a computationally derived tool based on RDoC workgroup reports identifies symptom distributions in clinician notes beyond those captured by ICD-9 codes, and these domains have significant predictive validity. More generally, they point to the possibility that clinicians already document RDoC-relevant symptoms, albeit not in a quantified form.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is an emerging evidence base about best practice in supporting recovery. This is usually framed in relation to general principles, and specific pro-recovery interventions are lacking.Aims: To develop a theoretically based and empirically defensible new pro-recovery manualised intervention--called the REFOCUS intervention.Method: Seven systematic and two narrative reviews were undertaken. Identified evidence gaps were addressed in three qualitative studies. The findings were synthesised to produce the REFOCUS intervention, manual and model.Results: The REFOCUS intervention comprises two components: recovery-promoting relationships and working practices. Approaches to supporting relationships comprise coaching skills training for staff, developing a shared team understanding of recovery, exploring staff values, a Partnership Project with people who use the service and raising patient expectations. Working practices comprise the following: understanding values and treatment preferences; assessing strengths; and supporting goal-striving. The REFOCUS model describes the causal pathway from the REFOCUS intervention to improved recovery.Conclusions: The REFOCUS intervention is an empirically supported pro-recovery intervention for use in mental health services. It will be evaluated in a multisite cluster randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN02507940).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a well-established treatment; however, the evidence is largely limited to homogenous samples. Although emerging research has indicated that CBT-I is also effective for comorbid insomnia, CBT-I has not been tested among a complex sample of older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression. Furthermore, no study has explored whether modifying CBT-I to target associated depressive symptoms could potentially enhance sleep and mood outcomes. Therefore, this study aims to report a protocol designed to test whether an advanced form of CBT for insomnia and depression (CBT-I-D) is more effective at reducing insomnia and depressive symptoms compared to a standard CBT-I and psychoeducation control group (PCG) for older adults in a community mental health setting.Methods/design: We aim to recruit 150 older adults with comorbid insomnia who have presented to community mental health services for depression. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated via block/cluster randomisation to one of three group therapy conditions: CBT-I, CBT-I-D, or PCG. Participants who receive CBT-I will only practice strategies designed to improve their sleep, whereas participants who receive CBT-I-D will practice additional strategies designed to also improve their mood. This trial will implement a mixed-methods design involving quantitative outcome measures and qualitative focus groups. The primary outcome measures are insomnia and depression severity, and secondary outcomes are anxiety, hopelessness, beliefs about sleep, comorbid sleep conditions, and health. Outcomes will be assessed at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and 3-month follow-up (week 20).Discussion: This CBT study protocol has been designed to address comorbid insomnia and depression for older adults receiving community mental health services. The proposed trial will determine whether CBT-I is more effective for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression compared to a PCG. It will also establish whether an advanced form of CBT-I-D generates greater reductions in insomnia and depression severity compared to standard CBT-I. The results from the proposed trial are anticipated to have important clinical implications for older adults, researchers, therapists, and community mental health services.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN: 12615000067572 , Date Registered 12 December 2014.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine the prevalence of nightmares in people with psychosis and to describe the link between nightmares and sleep quality, psychotic, affective, and cognitive symptoms.Methods: Forty participants with psychotic symptoms completed an assessment of nightmares, sleep quality, positive symptoms of psychosis, affect, posttraumatic stress, social functioning, and working memory.Results: Among the patients, 55% reported weekly distressing nightmares. Experience of more frequent nightmares was related to poorer sleep quality and sleep efficiency. More distressing nightmares were positively associated with greater delusional severity, depression, anxiety, stress, and difficulties with working memory.Conclusions: Nightmares might be common in those with psychosis and are associated with increased day- and nighttime impairment. Future research should investigate treatments for nightmares, for people presenting with psychotic symptoms.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Examiner la prévalence des cauchemars chez des personnes souffrant de psychose et décrire le lien entre les cauchemars et la qualité du sommeil, les symptômes psychotiques, affectifs, et cognitifs. Méthodes : Quarante participants ayant des symptômes psychotiques ont répondu à une évaluation des cauchemars, de la qualité du sommeil, des symptômes positifs de la psychose, de l’affect, du stress post-traumatique, du fonctionnement social et de la mémoire de travail. Résultats : Parmi les patients, 55 % ont déclaré des cauchemars troublants hebdomadaires. L’expérience de cauchemars plus fréquents était liée à une mauvaise qualité et une mauvaise efficacité du sommeil. Plus de cauchemars troublants étaient associés positivement à une gravité accrue des idées délirantes, à la dépression, à l’anxiété, au stress, et aux difficultés de la mémoire de travail. Conclusions : Les cauchemars peuvent être fréquents chez les personnes souffrant de psychose et ils sont associés à une incapacité accrue de jour et de nuit. La future recherche devrait se pencher sur les traitements des cauchemars pour les personnes présentant des symptômes psychotiques.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of the research was to investigate social workers' beliefs about the value of interventions for schizophrenia and depression; to determine their capacity to detect the mental health problem described in the vignette; and to compare the results of social workers with the general public and other health professionals. A total of 1,277 questionnaires were distributed to social workers which were previously used to examine the beliefs of psychiatrists, general practitioners, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and the general public. There was a 30.3 per cent (n = 387) response rate. Participants responded to a vignette describing a person with either depression or schizophrenia and rated a range of interventions as helpful, harmful or neither. The majority of respondents identified depression (90 per cent, n = 166) but only 59 per cent (n = 120) recognised schizophrenia. The research demonstrates that social workers support a broad range of interventions and endorsed the lifestyle interventions more than any of the other professionals. However, the research also suggests that social workers may have difficulties in both accurate awareness of mental health problems and in knowledge of current treatment practices. It is important that social workers receive adequate mental health education in their undergraduate degrees, to aid in the recognition and treatment of mental illness, so that people suffering from mental illness receive optimum care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In contrast with the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines, the most common treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders in primary care is pharmacological. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioural psychological intervention, delivered by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder compared to usual care. Methods/Design: This is an open-label, multicentre, randomized, and controlled study with two parallel groups. A random sample of 246 patients will be recruited with mild-to-moderate mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, from the target population on the lists of 41 primary care doctors. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group, who will receive standardised cognitive-behavioural therapy delivered by psychologists together with usual care, or to a control group, who will receive usual care alone. The cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention is composed of eight individual 60-minute face-to face sessions conducted in eight consecutive weeks. A follow-up session will be conducted over the telephone, for reinforcement or referral as appropriate, 6 months after the intervention, as required. The primary outcome variable will be the change in scores on the Short Form-36 General Health Survey. We will also measure the change in the frequency and intensity of anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months later. Additionally, we will collect information on the use of drugs and health care services. Discussion: The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a primary care-based cognitive-behavioural psychological intervention in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The international scientific evidence has demonstrated the need for psychologists in primary care. However, given the differences between health policies and health services, it is important to test the effect of these psychological interventions in our geographical setting.

        <ab>Objectives: Pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an increased risk of developing depression compared with community controls. Depression often negatively influences illness behaviors such as resource utilization. We sought to investigate the effects of treating depression on utilization of medical resources in depressed pediatric patients with IBD by comparing rates of health care utilization 1 year before and after psychotherapy.Method: Two hundred seventeen subjects ages 9 to 17 years with IBD and depression received 3 months of psychotherapy for depression as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Of these 217 subjects, 70 had utilization data available 1 year prior and 1 year after receiving 3 months of psychotherapy. Primary outcomes included frequency of hospitalizations, inpatient hospital days, outpatient gastrointestinal visits, and number of emergency room visits, radiological examinations, and endoscopies. Within subject analyses were completed comparing health care utilization 12 months before psychotherapy compared with the 12 months after the conclusion of psychotherapy.Results: Fifty-one and 19 patients had CD and UC, respectively. A total of 55.7% of patients had major depression and 44.3% had minor depression. Overall, all study measures of health care utilization were significantly reduced after psychotherapy (P &lt; 0.01)-including gastrointestinal-related (mean values) hospitalization frequency, inpatient days, outpatient visit, emergency room visits, radiological examinations, and endoscopies.Conclusions: Psychotherapy for comorbid depression in pediatric patients with IBD is associated with decreased GI-related health care utilization. The present study highlights the importance of screening for depression in a pediatric population with IBD, and that psychotherapy may be a reasonable adjunctive treatment for pediatric patients with IBD and comorbid depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This evaluation was designed to assess the impact of providing integrated primary and mental health care on utilization and costs for outpatient medical, inpatient hospital, and emergency department treatment among persons with serious mental illness.Methods: Two safety-net, community mental health centers that received a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) grant were the focus of this study. Clinic 1 had a ten-year history of providing integrated services whereas clinic 2 began integrated services with the PBHCI grant. Difference-in-differences (DID) analyses were used to compare individuals enrolled in the PBHCI programs (N=373, clinic 1; N=389, clinic 2) with propensity score-matched comparison groups of equal size at each site by using data obtained from medical records.Results: Relative to the comparison groups, a higher proportion of PBHCI clients used outpatient medical services at both sites following program enrollment (p&lt;.003, clinic 1; p&lt;.001, clinic 2). At clinic 1, PBHCI was also associated with a reduction in the proportion of clients with an inpatient hospital admission (p=.04) and a trend for a reduction in inpatient hospital costs per member per month of $217.68 (p=.06). Hospital-related cost savings were not observed for PBHCI clients at clinic 2 nor were there significant differences between emergency department use or costs for PBHCI and comparison groups at either clinic.Conclusions: Investments in PBHCI can improve access to outpatient medical care for persons with severe mental illness and may also curb hospitalizations and associated costs in more established programs.</ab>

        <ab>Students in secondary schools experience problems that can impact on their well- being and educational outcomes. Although face-to-face counselling is available in most Australian secondary schools, many students, particularly boys, do not seek appropriate help. Research suggests that online counselling can be effective and increase engagement. This study of 215 secondary school students sought to assess students ’ intention to use online counselling if it was made available in schools. The results found no gender difference in the likely intentions to seek online help though year level was significant and students experiencing psychological distress had a preference for online counselling. If students did use online counselling it was more likely they would discuss sensitive topics rather than for career issues. Implications for school counselling are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Children and young people of parents with mental illness (COPMI) are at risk of poor mental, physical and emotional health, which can persist into adulthood. They also experience poorer social outcomes and wellbeing as well as poorer quality of life than their peers with 'healthy' parents. The needs of COPMI are likely to be significant; however, their prevalence is unknown, although estimates suggest over 60% of adults with a serious mental illness have children. Many receive little or no support and remain 'hidden', stigmatised or do not regard themselves as 'in need'. Recent UK policies have identified supporting COPMI as a key priority, but this alone is insufficient and health-related quality of life has been neglected as an outcome.Methods/design: An age-appropriate standardised intervention for COPMI, called Young SMILES, was developed in collaboration with service users, National Health Service (NHS) and non-NHS stakeholders in our previous work. This protocol describes a randomised feasibility trial comparing Young SMILES with usual care, involving 60 families that will be identified through third sector organisations and NHS services, and recruited and randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive Young SMILES or usual care. Outcomes of the feasibility trial are rates of recruitment, follow-up and withdrawals, intervention uptake, and engagement. The optimal child-reported outcomes will also be determined alongside the assessment of resource use. A qualitative evaluation conducted at 3-months will explore the experiences and views of children and young people as well as parents accessing the intervention and the facilitators delivering the intervention.Discussion: This paper details the rationale, design, training and recruitment methods for a feasibility study to inform the design and effective implementation of a larger scale randomised controlled trial of Young SMILES.Trial Registration: ISRCTN36865046 , registered 18 December 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Guidelines recommend screening patients for unhealthy behaviors and mental health concerns. Health risk assessments can systematically identify patient needs and trigger care. This study seeks to evaluate whether primary care practices can routinely implement such assessments into routine care.Methods: As part of a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial, 9 diverse primary care practices implemented My Own Health Report (MOHR)-an electronic or paper-based health behavior and mental health assessment and feedback system paired with counseling and goal setting. We observed how practices integrated MOHR into their workflows, what additional practice staff time it required, and what percentage of patients completed a MOHR assessment (Reach).Results: Most practices approached (60%) agreed to adopt MOHR. How they implemented MOHR depended on practice resources, informatics capacity, and patient characteristics. Three practices mailed patients invitations to complete MOHR on the Web, 1 called patients and completed MOHR over the telephone, 1 had patients complete MOHR on paper in the office, and 4 had staff help patients complete MOHR on the Web in the office. Overall, 3,591 patients were approached and 1,782 completed MOHR (Reach = 49.6%). Reach varied by implementation strategy with higher reach when MOHR was completed by staff than by patients (71.2% vs 30.2%, P &lt;.001). No practices were able to sustain the complete MOHR assessment without adaptations after study completion. Fielding MOHR increased staff and clinician time an average of 28 minutes per visit.Conclusions: Primary care practices can implement health behavior and mental health assessments, but counseling patients effectively requires effort. Practices will need more support to implement and sustain assessments.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The assessment of 'general health and well-being' in public mental health research stimulates debates around relative merits of questionnaire instruments and their items. Little evidence regarding alignment or differential advantages of instruments or items has appeared to date.Aims: Population-based psychometric study of items employed in public mental health narratives.Method: Multidimensional item response theory was applied to General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and EQ-5D items (Health Survey for England, 2010-2012; n = 19 290).Results: A bifactor model provided the best account of the data and showed that the GHQ-12 and WEMWBS items assess mainly the same construct. Only one item of the EQ-5D showed relevant overlap with this dimension (anxiety/depression). Findings were corroborated by comparisons with alternative models and cross-validation analyses.Conclusions: The consequences of this lack of differentiation (GHQ-12 v. WEMWBS) for mental health and well-being narratives deserves discussion to enrich debates on priorities in public mental health and its assessment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. The aim of this analysis is to examine the longitudinal impact of symptoms of depression/ anxiety on treatment response, long-term disease activity and physical disability in RA. Methods. Secondary analysis of clinical trial data was performed. Data were collected at baseline and at 6-monthly intervals for 2 years. The EuroQoL (EQ-5D™) indicated depression/anxiety symptom severity. Our primary outcomes of interest were (i) DAS-28 and (ii) physical disability measured via the HAQ. Secondary outcomes were: tender and swollen joint counts, patient global assessment, ESR and odds of reaching clinical remission. Multilevel models were used to assess the impact of baseline and persistent depression/anxiety on outcomes over 2 years. Results. Data from 379 patients were included. After adjusting for covariates, baseline depression/anxiety symptoms were associated with increased DAS-28 outcomes and increased tender joint counts. Persistent depression/anxiety symptoms were associated with increased DAS-28 scores, HAQ scores, tender joint counts and patient global assessment of disease activity, and reduced odds of reaching clinical remission. Patients with symptoms of depression/anxiety at baseline also showed a 50% reduction in prednisolone treatment effect, in comparison with patients with no symptoms of depression/anxiety at baseline. Conclusion. Baseline and persistent symptoms of depression/anxiety are associated with poorer health outcomes over time, as well as reduced treatment response. Mental health should be routinely measured both in clinical practice and in research, and managed alongside rheumatological disease to optimize health outcomes. Further research is required to examine whether treatment of mental disorders can improve rheumatological outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Schools are an ideal setting in which to promote health. However, empirical data on the effectiveness of school-based mental health promotion programs are rare, and research on universal Internet-based prevention in schools is almost non-existent. Following the life skills approach, stress management training is an important component of health promotion. Mental health literacy is also associated with mental health status, and it facilitates formal help-seeking by children and adolescents (C&amp;A). The main objectives of this study are (1) the development and evaluation of an Internet-based version of a universal school-based health promotion program called StresSOS and (2) demonstrating non-inferiority of the online setting compared to the face-to-face setting. StresSOS aims to improve stress management and mental health literacy in C&amp;A.Methods/design: A school-based sample of 15,000 C&amp;A (grades 6-13 and older than 12 years) will be recruited in five regions of Germany within the ProHEAD Consortium. Those with a screening result at baseline indicating no mental health problems will be invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial comparing StresSOS online to an active online control condition (Study A). In addition, 420 adolescents recruited as a separate school-based sample will participate in the StresSOS face-to-face intervention. Participants in both intervention groups (online or face-to-face) will receive the same eight treatment modules to allow for the comparison of both methods of delivery (Study B). The primary outcome is the number of C&amp;A with symptoms of mental health problems at a 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are related to stress/coping (i.e., knowledge, symptoms of stress, coping resources), mental health literacy (knowledge and attitudes toward mental disorders and help-seeking), program usage patterns, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of the intervention.Discussion: This study represents the first adequately powered non-inferiority trial in the area of school-based mental health promotion. If online StresSOS proves efficacious and non-inferior to face-to-face delivery, this offers great potential for health promotion in youths, both in and outside the school environment.Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00014693 .

        <ab>OBJECTIVES : To provide descriptive information on behavioral health (BH) productivity and billing practices within a pediatric primary care setting. METHODS : This retrospective investigation reviewed 30 months of electronic medical records and financial data. RESULTS : The percent of BH provider time spent in direct patient care (productivity) was 35.28% overall, with a slightly higher quarterly average (M  =  36.42%; SD  =  6.46%). In the 646.75 hr BH providers spent in the primary care setting, $52,050.00 was charged for BH services delivered ($80.48 hourly average). CONCLUSIONS : BH productivity and billing within pediatric primary care were suboptimal and likely multifactorially derived. To promote integrated primary care sustainability, the authors recommend three future aims: improve BH productivity, demonstrate the value-added contributions of BH services within primary care, and advocate for BH-supporting health care reform.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The current study examines the scope of integrated behavioral health services provided by behavioral health clinicians in pediatric primary care.Methods: A cross-sectional electronic health record review was conducted to characterize integrated behavioral health services including consultation types, recommendations, and medical diagnoses. Services were provided over a 6-year period in an urban, residency-training clinic serving a primarily publicly insured population.Results: Of the 4,440 patients seen by behavioral health clinicians (BHCs), 2,829 (63.7%) were seen during well-child checks to address a wide array of presenting problems. The five consultation types "Healthy Steps (6%), pregnancy-related depression (17.7%), developmental (19.2%), mental health (53.2%), and psychopharmacology (5%)" were characterized by differences in demographics, presenting problems, recommendations, and medical diagnoses.Conclusions: Pediatric BHCs provide a wide range of services to pediatric populations in the context of integrated behavioral health programs. Implications for workforce capacity development, evaluation of outcomes and impact, and sustainability are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Alignment across levels of leadership within an organization is needed for successful implementation of evidence-based practice. The leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI) intervention is a multi-faceted multilevel implementation strategy focusing on enhancing first-level general and implementation leadership while also engaging with organization upper management to develop an organizational climate for implementation. The aim of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of LOCI in supporting the implementation of evidence-based treatment for PTSD in child- and adult-specialized mental health clinics in health trusts in Norway.Methods: The study design is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with enrollment of clinics in three cohorts. Executives, clinic leaders, and therapists will be asked to complete surveys assessing leadership and implementation climate. Surveys will be completed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 months. Results from surveys will be shared with executives and clinic leaders to inform the subsequent creation of tailored leadership and climate development plans for enhanced implementation. Patients will complete surveys measuring traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms during the therapy process. Therapy sessions will be audio or video recorded and scored for fidelity as part of training.Discussion: This study aims to provide knowledge on how to improve leadership and organizational climate to enhance effective implementation of evidence-based treatments in mental health services.Trial Registration: The study has been registrated in ClinicalTrials with ID NCT03719651 .</ab>

        <ab>Aim: To assess the effectiveness of a 12 week specialized, integrated intervention for alcohol dependence with comorbid anxiety and/or mood disorder using a randomized design in an outpatient hospital setting. Methods: Out of 86 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for alcohol dependence with suspicion of comorbid anxiety and/or depressive disorder, 57 completed a 3-week stabilization period (abstinence or significantly reduced consumption). Of these patients, 37 (65%) met a formal diagnostic assessment of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder and were randomized to either (a) integrated intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy) for alcohol, anxiety and/or depression, or (b) usual counselling care for alcohol problems. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed a beneficial treatment effect of integrated treatment relative to usual counselling care for the number of days to relapse (X2 = 6.42, P &lt; 0.05) and lapse (X2 = 10.73, P &lt; 0.01). In addition, there was a significant interaction effect of treatment and time for percentage days of abstinence (P &lt; 0.05). For heavy drinking days, the treatment effect was mediated by changes in DASS anxiety (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant treatment interaction effects for DASS depression or anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These results provide support for integrated care in improving drinking outcomes for patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid depression/anxiety disorder.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined mental health service use among three groups of young adults with assessed psychological distress: no perceived need for treatment, reported unmet need, and received treatment.Methods: Data came from participants ages 18 to 25 in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008-2013) who met criteria for psychological distress (N=19,775). Demographic, access-, and need-related predictors of perceived need and treatment group were examined by using multinomial logistic regression.Results: Half the sample did not perceive a need for treatment (51.0%), and only one-third had received treatment (33.7%). White youths were more likely than those from other racial-ethnic groups to perceive a need and to receive treatment. Men were less likely than women to perceive need but equally likely to receive treatment. Higher education and having insurance also predicted treatment receipt.Conclusions: Efforts to increase service utilization among young adults should increase awareness of mental health problems and facilitate access, particularly for racial-ethnic minority groups.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patients repeatedly presenting with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) to their GPs, suffer from their symptoms. Experts in the field suggest a multicomponent approach for these patients. Brief multimodal psychosomatic therapy (BMPT) is such an intervention.Objectives: To test the systematic identification of eligible patients, acceptability of BMPT and potential treatment effects of BMPT.Methods: The participants in this randomized pilot trial, patients consulting their GPs more than once with MUS, were randomized to intervention [usual care (UC) and additional BMPT] or control condition (UC alone).We monitored the number of patients identified and recruited, trial recruitment and retention. Potential treatment effects were measured with perceived symptom severity [Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)]; patients' self-rated symptoms of distress, depression, anxiety and somatization [Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ)]; symptoms of hyperventilation [Nijmegen Hyperventilation List (NHL)]; physical and mental health status and quality of life [Short-Form Health Survey-36 items (SF-36)]; and level of functioning (measure of general functioning). Follow-up was 1 year.Results: A total of 42 patients could be included in the trial. Four patients withdrew after randomization and two patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 36 patients (86%). During the 12-month follow-up after BMPT, there was an improvement in perceived symptom severity [adjusted mean difference -2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.6 to -0.3], in somatization (adjusted mean difference -4.4, 95% CI -7.5 to -1.4) and in symptoms of hyperventilation (adjusted mean difference -5.7, 95% CI -10.5 to -0.8).Conclusions: This randomized pilot study shows that a larger trial studying the effectiveness of BMPT in patients with MUS in primary care is feasible and useful.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors' objective was to determine how assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) has been implemented in actual practice in the 45 states with AOT statutes.Methods: A national survey of AOT programs was conducted to examine the extent to which AOT programs have been implemented and variations in implementation models.Results: Although 45 states have current AOT statutes, the most active programs were identified in 20 states. These programs varied considerably in style of implementation, criteria applied, agency responsible, use of a treatment plan, monitoring procedures, and numbers of participants involved. Three implementation models were identified: community gateway, hospital transition, and surveillance (or safety net). Common problems included inadequate resources, lack of enforcement power, inconsistent monitoring, and weakness of interagency collaboration.Conclusions: AOT is a widely applied and much-discussed mechanism for providing treatment to individuals with serious mental illnesses nationally. The uneven implementation of AOT programs within and across states highlights the ambivalence in the community, by judicial officials, and by mental health clinicians about the role and scope of AOT and the difficulties of implementation under existing funding constraints and statutory limitations.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To provide a review of the extant research literature on Housing First (HF) for people with severe mental illness (SMI) who are homeless and to describe the findings of the recently completed At Home (AH)-Chez soi (CS) demonstration project. HF represents a paradigm shift in the delivery of community mental health services, whereby people with SMI who are homeless are supported through assertive community treatment or intensive case management to move into regular housing. Method: The AH-CS demonstration project entailed a randomized controlled trial conducted in 5 Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013. Mixed methods were used to examine the implementation of HF programs and participant outcomes, comparing 1158 people receiving HF to 990 people receiving standard care. Results: Initial research conducted in the United States shows HF to be a promising approach, yielding superior outcomes in helping people to rapidly exit homelessness and establish stable housing. Findings from the AH-CS demonstration project reveal that HF can be successfully adapted to different contexts and for different populations without losing its fidelity. People receiving HF achieved superior housing outcomes and showed more rapid improvements in community functioning and quality of life than those receiving treatment as usual. Conclusions: Knowledge translation efforts have been undertaken to disseminate the positive findings and lessons learned from the AH-CS project and to scale up the HF approach across Canada.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Offrir une revue de la littérature de recherche existante sur le Logement D’abord (LA) pour les personnes souffrant de maladie mentale grave (MMG) qui sont sans abri, et décrire les résultats du projet de démonstration At Home (AH)–Chez soi (CS) terminé récemment. L’approche LA représente un changement de paradigme de la prestation des services de santé mentale communautaires, grâce auxquels les personnes souffrant de MMG qui sont sans abri sont soutenues par un traitement communautaire actif ou une gestion de cas intensive pour emménager dans un logement régulier. Méthode : Le projet de démonstration AH–CS comportait un essai randomisé contrôlé mené dans 5 villes canadiennes entre 2009 et 2013. Des méthodes mixtes ont été utilisées pour examiner la mise en oeuvre des programmes de LA et les résultats des participants, en comparant 1158 personnes recevant LA avec 990 personnes recevant des soins réguliers. Résultats : La recherche initiale menée aux États-Unis montre que LA est une approche prometteuse, qui donne des résultats supérieurs en ce qui concerne l’aid aux gens à sortir rapidement de l’itinérance et à s’établir dans un logement stable. Les résultats du projet de démonstration AH–CS révèlent que LA peut être adapté avec succès à différents contextes et pour différentes populations, sans perdre son intégrité. Les personnes recevant LA ont eu des résultats de logement supérieurs et ont fait preuve d’améliorations plus rapides du fonctionnement communautaire et de la qualité de vie que ceux recevant le traitement régulier. Conclusions : Des initiatives de transfert des connaissances ont été prises pour diffuser les résultats positifs et les leçons tirées du projet AH–CS, et pour étendre l’approche LA à tout le Canada.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In mental health settings, implementation of and adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) is low. Strategies are needed to overcome barriers and facilitate successful implementation of CPGs into standard care. The goals of this study were to develop a framework for the implementation of a CPG for schizophrenia for hospitalized service users in a mental health care facility, and to monitor adherence to the guideline.Methods: An eight-step framework was developed based on project management principles: 1) the Appraisal Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool was used to rate and select a CPG; 2) an algorithm was created from the guideline; 3) a gap analysis identified clinical services and processes not conforming with the CPG recommendations; 4) a governance structure was created; 5) a modified Delphi process determined key outcome and process adherence metrics; 6) a project charter was developed; 7) clinical informatics ensured that systems and tools were in place to support the CPG; and 8) therapeutic services were realigned to match the requirements of the CPG within specified fiscal constraints. Percent adherence to the identified process adherence metrics was calculated before (March 2014) and for 12 months after implementation (April 2014-March 2015).Results: The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline scored highest on AGREE and was used to develop the algorithm. Cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis (CBT-P), art therapy and carer assessments were identified as gaps in care. Clinical global impression - Schizophrenia score was identified as the primary service user outcome variable and antipsychotic polypharmacy, metabolic monitoring, CBT-P referral and supported employment/vocational services referral as the primary process adherence measures. Adherence to guidance for metabolic monitoring (March 2014, 76.7 %; March 2015, 81.6 %), CBT-P referral (March 2014, 6.5 %; March 2015, 11.4 %) and vocational rehabilitation referral (March 2014, 36.6 %; March 2015, 49.1 %) were increased after CPG implementation. There was an initial increase in adherence to antipsychotic monotherapy (March 2014, 53.4 %; November 2014, 62.7 %), which decreased back toward baseline (March 2015, 55.1 %).Conclusions: The eight-step framework was used to implement a CPG process, though further quality improvements initiatives may be needed to improve adherence.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Housing First is emerging as an evidence-based practice for housing and supporting people who are homeless and have a mental illness. The objective of this study was to determine whether Housing First increases the odds of obtaining competitive employment in this population and affects income, including income from informal and illegal sources.Methods: A total of 2,148 people with a mental illness were recruited from five Canadian cities while they were homeless, classified as having moderate or high needs, and randomly assigned to Housing First or usual care. Housing First participants with high needs received assertive community treatment (ACT), and those with moderate needs received intensive case management (ICM). Every three months, participants were interviewed about employment and earnings in the previous months (median follow-up=745 days). Regression models were estimated via generalized estimating equations.Results: ICM recipients had lower odds of obtaining employment compared with the control group with moderate needs. The odds of obtaining employment among ICM recipients increased but their employment rate never exceeded that of the control group. For ACT recipients, the odds of obtaining employment were not significantly different from those of the control group. Among Housing First participants, persons employed at baseline, men, and younger participants had greater odds of employment compared with control participants. Housing First did not appear to significantly increase income.Conclusions: This was the first large-scale randomized controlled study of Housing First's effects on employment. Further research is needed to determine how Housing First may be enhanced to increase odds of obtaining employment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Around 17% of people eligible for UK cardiac rehabilitation programmes following an acute coronary syndrome report moderate or severe depressive symptoms. While maximising psychological health is a core goal of cardiac rehabilitation, psychological care can be fragmented and patchy. This study tests the feasibility and acceptability of embedding enhanced psychological care, composed of two management strategies of proven effectiveness in other settings (nurse-led mental health care coordination and behavioural activation), within the cardiac rehabilitation care pathway.Methods/design: This study tests the uncertainties associated with a large-scale evaluation by conducting an external pilot trial with a nested qualitative study. We aim to recruit and randomise eight comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation teams (clusters) to intervention (embedding enhanced psychological care into routine cardiac rehabilitation programmes) or control (routine cardiac rehabilitation programmes alone) arms. Up to 64 patients (eight per team) identified with depressive symptoms upon initial assessment by the cardiac rehabilitation team will be recruited, and study measures will be administered at baseline (before starting rehabilitation) and at 5 months and 8 months post baseline. Outcomes include depressive symptoms, cardiac mortality and morbidity, anxiety, health-related quality of life and service resource use. Trial data on cardiac team and patient recruitment, and the retention and flow of patients through treatment will be used to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability. Qualitative interviews will be undertaken to explore trial participants' and cardiac rehabilitation nurses' views and experiences of the trial methods and intervention, and to identify reasons why patients declined to take part in the trial. Outcome data will inform a sample size calculation for a definitive trial.Discussion: The pilot trial and qualitative study will inform the design of a fully powered cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the provision of enhanced psychological care within cardiac rehabilitation programmes.Trial Registration: ISRCTN34701576 (Registered 29 May 2014).</ab>

        <ab>Background: A growing number of studies document the association between maternal experiences of racial discrimination and adverse children's outcomes, but our understanding of how experiences of racial discrimination are associated with pre- and post-natal maternal mental health, is limited. In addition, existent literature rarely takes into consideration racial discrimination experienced by the partner. Methods: We analysed data from the Growing Up in New Zealand study to examine the burden of lifetime and past year experiences of racial discrimination on prenatal and postnatal mental health among Māori, Pacific, and Asian women in New Zealand (NZ), and to study the individual and joint contribution of mother's and partner's experiences of lifetime and past year racial discrimination to women's prenatal and postnatal mental health. Results: Our findings show strong associations between lifetime and past year experiences of ethnically-motivated interpersonal attacks and unfair treatment on mother's mental health. Māori, Pacific, and Asian women who had experienced unfair treatment by a health professional in their lifetime were 66 % more likely to suffer from postnatal depression, compared to women who did not report these experiences. We found a cumulative effect of lifetime experiences of ethnically-motivated personal attacks on poor maternal mental health if both the mother and the partner had experienced a racist attack. Conclusions: Experiences of racial discrimination have severe direct consequences for the mother's mental health. Given the importance of mother's mental health for the basic human needs of a healthy child, racism and racial discrimination should be addressed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression has been identified as one of the most frequent predictors of CAM use. However, limited data exist about the use of CAM providers among people with anxiety/depression in Norway. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of CAM providers, and the use of CAM providers and psychiatric outpatient services in combination, among people with self-reported anxiety and/or depression. Methods: We used questionnaire data from 12,982 participants (30-87 years) in the cross-sectional sixth Tromsø Study (conducted in 2007-8). Eligible for analyses in our study were 1685 participants who reported suffering from anxiety and/or depression. By descriptive statistical methods, we estimated the use of CAM providers, psychiatric outpatient services, and the combination of these. By logistic regressions we studied the association between the use of these services and gender, age, income, education, and self-reported degree of anxiety/depression. Results: During the previous year, 17.8 % of people with anxiety/depression visited a CAM provider once or more, 11.8 % visited psychiatric outpatient services, and 2.5 % visited both. Men with anxiety/depression were less likely to visit CAM providers compared to women (odds ratio [OR] 0.40, confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.55), whereas higher educated people were more likely to visit compared to the lowest educated (OR 1.47, CI 1.02-2.13). The use of CAM providers was not associated with the degree of anxiety/depression. For those who used both CAM providers and psychiatric specialist services during the previous year, severe anxiety/depression was strongly associated with use compared to moderate disease (OR 7.53, CI 2.75-20.65). Conclusions: People with severe anxiety/depression seem to use CAM providers and psychiatric services additionally, whereas those with moderate disease seem to use these services more as alternative pathways. CAM provider treatment might be a substitute for conventional care, particularly in patients with moderate disease.</ab>

        <ab>Interest in providing integrated psychological and medical services in pediatric primary care is growing rapidly. Efforts to incorporate psychological services into primary care settings are leading to new models and innovative approaches to evaluation and treatment in a variety of settings. Presently, there is a need to expand the empirical base for such work and to critically evaluate what is being done. The introduction to this special section discusses some of the background for the development of integrated care, and provides some context for the articles that follow. These articles address issues related to screening in integrated pediatric primary care, the variety of services provided in the context of integrated primary care, and outline the competencies needed for providing high-quality care in such settings. Suggestions for future research directions are provided.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This paper provides a report of an academic department of psychiatry's journey into the change process associated with addressing the new requirements in health-care delivery, the emphasis on person-centered treatment models, and the implications for residency training programs. Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Department of Psychiatry's experience is based on responding to real-world shifts in which academic departments can play a leadership role.Methods: Importantly, methods are based on person-centered collaboration being central to a successful change process and include a description of the training, with data supporting implementation of the model.Results: The model demonstrates increased access to care and improved behavioral health symptoms. It indicates that with proper training and supervision, psychiatry residents can be an agent of change.Conclusion: This brief review of our experience offers to other departments of psychiatry examples of collaborative strategies substantially informed by the needs and preferences of both persons accessing services and local communities.</ab>

        <ab>As restructuring a negative cognitive style is a central skill taught in many depression prevention programs, we tested whether a universal prevention program evoked a change in negative cognitive style in adolescents. In addition, we examined distinct developmental trajectories of negative cognitive styles and assessed whether research condition (intervention versus control) predicted these trajectories. Young adolescents (n=1343; Mean age=13.4 years; SD=0.77; 52.3%girls) were randomly allocated to a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based depression prevention program or a care as usual control condition. A negative cognitive style was assessed at baseline, post-treatment and 6- and 12-months follow-up. Adolescents who received the intervention did not differ in their negative cognitive style from the control group at any time-point. We found four distinctive trajectories of negative cognitive style: normative, increasing, decreasing and stable high, which were not predicted by intervention condition and were not moderated by gender. Yet, the results revealed a trend, which indicated that adolescents who followed the program tended to show an increasing than a normative developmental pattern. We concluded that the CBTbased depression prevention program did not reduce or prevent an increase in negative cognitive style.</ab>

        <ab>SEE SCHRAG AND POLITIS DOI101093/AWW190 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS ARTICLE: Apathy, which can occur separately or in combination with depression and anxiety, is one of the most frequently encountered neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Pathophysiological evidence suggests that parkinsonian apathy is primarily due to a mesolimbic dopaminergic denervation, but the role of the serotonergic alteration has never been examined, despite its well-known involvement in the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety. To fill this gap, we address here the pure model of de novo Parkinson's disease, without the confounding effects of antiparkinsonian treatment. Fifteen apathetic (Lille Apathy Rating Scale scores ≥ -21) and 15 non-apathetic (-36 ≤ Lille Apathy Rating Scale scores ≤ -22) drug-naïve de novo parkinsonian patients were enrolled in the present study and underwent detailed clinical assessment and positron emission tomography imaging, using both dopaminergic [(11)C-N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-methylphenyl)-nortropane (PE2I)] (n = 29) and serotonergic [(11)C-N,N-dimethyl-2-(-2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio)-benzylamine (DASB)] (n = 27) presynaptic transporter radioligands. Apathetic parkinsonian patients presented higher depression (P = 0.0004) and anxiety (P = 0.004) scores - as assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and the part B of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively - compared to the non-apathetic ones - who were not different from the age-matched healthy subjects (n = 15). Relative to the controls, the non-apathetic parkinsonian patients mainly showed dopaminergic denervation (n = 14) within the right caudate nucleus, bilateral putamen, thalamus and pallidum, while serotonergic innervation (n = 15) was fairly preserved. Apathetic parkinsonian patients exhibited, compared to controls, combined and widespread dopaminergic (n = 15) and serotonergic (n = 12) degeneration within the bilateral caudate nuclei, putamen, ventral striatum, pallidum and thalamus, but also a specific bilateral dopaminergic disruption within the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area complex, as well as a specific serotonergic alteration within the insula, the orbitofrontal and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortices. When comparing the two parkinsonian groups, the apathetic patients mainly displayed greater serotonergic alteration in the ventral striatum, the dorsal and the subgenual parts of the anterior cingulate cortices, bilaterally, as well as in the right-sided caudate nucleus and the right-sided orbitofrontal cortex. Regression analyses also revealed that the severity of apathy was moreover mainly related to specific serotonergic lesions within the right-sided anterior caudate nucleus and the orbitofrontal cortex, while the degree of both depression and anxiety was primarily linked to serotonergic disruption within the bilateral subgenual parts and/or the right dorsal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, without prominent role of the dopaminergic degeneration in the pathogenesis of these three non-motor signs. Altogether, these findings highlight a prominent role of the serotonergic degeneration in the expression of the neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring at the onset of Parkinson's disease.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Early intervention services (EIS) for psychosis have been developed in several countries, including Canada. There is some agreement about the program elements considered essential for improving the long-term outcomes for patients in the early phase of psychotic disorders. In the absence of national standards, the current state of EIS for psychosis in Canada needs to be examined in relation to expert recommendations currently available.Method: A detailed online benchmark survey was developed and administered to 11 Canadian academic EIS programs covering administrative, clinical, education, and research domains. In addition, an electronic database and Internet search was conducted to find existing guidelines for EIS. Survey results were then compared with the existing expert recommendations.Results: Most of the surveyed programs offer similar services, in line with published expert recommendations (i.e., easy and rapid access, intensive follow-up through case management with emphasis on patient engagement and continuity of care, and a range of integrated evidence-based psychosocial interventions). However, differences are observed among programs in admission and discharge criteria, services for patients at ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis, patient to clinician ratios, accessibility of services, and existence of specific inpatient units. These seem to diverge from expert recommendations.Conclusions: Although Canadian programs are following most expert recommendations on clinical components of care, some programs lack administrative and organizational elements considered essential. Continued mentoring and networking of clinicians through organizations such as the Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis (CCEIP), as well as the development of a fidelity scale through further research, could possibly help programs attain and maintain the best standards of early intervention. However, simply making clinical guidelines available to care providers is not sufficient for changing practices; this will need to be accompanied by adequate funding and support from organizations and policy makers.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Les services d'intervention précoce (SIP) pour la psychose se sont développés dans plusieurs pays incluant le Canada. Certains éléments sont considérés essentiels pour améliorer l'issue clinique du traitement dans les phases précoces des troubles psychotiques. En l'absence de guides de pratique nationaux, l'état actuel des SIP au Canada nécessite d'être examiné et comparé aux recommandations d'expert disponibles. Méthode : Un sondage détaillé a été élaboré et administré en ligne a I I SIP universitaires canadiens. Le sondage couvrait les aspects administratifs et cliniques ainsi que la formation et la recherche. Une recherche sur les bases de données électroniques ainsi que sur Internet a été faite afin de repérer des guides de pratique existants pour les SIP. Les données recueillies lors du sondage ont été comparées aux recommandations d'expert existantes. Résultats : La plupart des programmes sondés offrent des services similaires, qui sont conformes aux principes fondamentaux de l'intervention précoce, i.e. un accès facile et rapide, un suivi intensif dont l'emphase est mise sur l'engagement du patient et la continuité des soins, ainsi qu'une gamme d'interventions biopsychosociales intégrées fondées sur des données probantes. Toutefois, des différences sont observées parmi les programmes en ce qui concerne les critères d'admission et de fin de suivi, les services offerts aux patients à ultra haut risque (UHR) de psychose, les ratios patients-clinicien, l'accessibilité des services et l'existence d'unités d'hospitalisation spécifiques. Ces éléments semblent diverger des recommandations d'expert. Conclusions : Bien que les programmes canadiens suivent la plupart des recommandations d'expert sur les composantes cliniques des soins, certains programmes n'ont pas implanté des éléments administratifs etorganisationnels jugés essentiels. Le mentorat et le réseautage de cliniciens via des organisations telles que le Consortium canadien pour l'intervention précoce en psychose (CCIPP), ainsi que l'élaboration éventuelle d'une échelle de fidélité par le biais de recherches futures, pourraient aider les programmes à atteindre et maintenir les meilleurs standards pour les SIP. Cependant, le simple fait de présenter des guides de pratique aux cliniciens ne suffit pas à changer les pratiques; il est nécessaire que ce soit accompagné d'un financement adéquat et du soutien de la part des organisations et des décideurs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Rapid advances in information technology and telecommunications have resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of mobile devices and the internet to enhance and facilitate access to treatment. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an empirically based treatment that is well suited for enhancement by new technologies, particularly with youth. To facilitate the dissemination of this evidence-based treatment, we developed a technology-enhanced CBT intervention for the treatment of adolescent depression consisting of (1) online therapist training (2) in-session use of tablets for teaching clients CBT concepts and skills, and (3) text messaging for between session homework reminders and self-monitoring. Methods: Eighteen licensed clinicians (social workers n = 7, psychologists n = 9) were randomized to have their patients receive either the intervention (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Each clinician treated four adolescents for 12 weeks. Clinicians in the CBT arm completed an online tutorial on CBT treatment of adolescent depression, then received an iPad with access to patient education materials for teaching CBT concepts to patients during sessions. Individualized text messages were integrated into treatment for homework reminders, support, and outcomes measurement. Outcome measures included a 49-item multiple choice test for tutorial effectiveness; the system usability scale (SUS) for user satisfaction; quick inventory of depressive symptomatology--adolescent version (QIDS-A-Pat); and clinician and patient ratings on the therapeutic alliance scale for adolescents (TASA). Results: A significant increase in knowledge of CBT concepts was found after completing the tutorial, t(8) = 7.02, p &lt; 0.001. Clinician and patient ratings of user satisfaction were high for both the iPad teaching tools, and the text messaging. Ninety-five percent of teens said reviewing their text messages with their therapist was helpful, and all said they would use text messaging in treatment again. Ratings of the therapeutic alliance were higher in the CBT arm t(131) = 4.03, p = 0.001. A significant reduction in depression was found in both groups [t(34) = 8.453, p &lt; 0.001 and t(29) = 6.67, p &lt; 0.001 for CBT and TAU, respectively). Clinical ratings of improvement were greater on all outcome measures for the CBT arm; however, none reached statistical significance. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranged from small (QIDS-A) to large (TASA). Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of this technology-enhanced CBT intervention as a means of improving CBT treatment of adolescent depression and may help address the critical shortage of therapists trained on empirically based treatments.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: People with mental illness suffer stigma and discrimination across various contexts, including the health care setting, and clinicians' attitudes play an important role in perpetuating stigma. Effective stigma-reduction interventions for physicians require a better understanding of explicit (that is, conscious and controllable) and implicit (that is, subconscious and automatic) forms of bias, and of predictors and moderators of stigma. Methods: Members of a Canadian university psychiatry department and of the Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) were invited to participate in a web-based study consisting of 2 measures of explicit attitudes, the Social Distance Scale (SDS) and the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC), and 1 measure of implicit attitudes, the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Results: Thirty-five psychiatry residents and 68 psychiatrists completed the study (response rates of 12.1% for the university sample and 3.3% for the CPA sample). Participants desired greater social distance from the vignette patient with schizophrenia. Mean IAT scores, although negative, did not reach the threshold for a meaningful effect size. Patient contact positively predicted IAT scores, while age, sex, and level of training (resident, compared with psychiatrist) did not. Neither patient contact nor implicit attitudes predicted SDS or OMS-HC scores. Conclusion: Psychiatrists did not differ from psychiatry residents on any measures of explicit or implicit attitudes toward mental illness. Explicit attitudes toward people with mental illness were relatively negative; implicit attitudes were neither negative nor positive; and implicit and explicit attitudes were not correlated. Greater patient contact predicted more positive implicit attitudes, but did not predict explicit attitudes.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Les personnes souffrant de maladie mentale subissent la stigmatisation et la discrimination dans divers contextes, y compris le milieu des soins de santé, et les attitudes des cliniciens jouent un rôle important dans la perpétuation des stigmates. Les interventions efficaces de réduction des stigmates pour les médecins exigent de mieux comprendre les formes de biais explicites (c'est-à-dire, conscientes et contrôlables) et implicites (c'està-dire, inconscientes et automatiques), ainsi que les prédicteurs et modérateurs des stigmates. Méthodes : Des membres d'un département de psychiatrie d'une université canadienne et de l'Association des psychiatres du Canada (APC) ont été invités à participer à une étude en ligne consistant en 2 mesures des attitudes explicites, l'échelle de distance sociale (SDS) et l'échelle d'ouverture d'esprit pour les prestataires de soins de santé (OMS-HC), et en 1 mesure des attitudes implicites, le test d'association implicite (IAT). Résultats : Trente-cinq résidents en psychiatrie et 68 psychiatres ont répondu à l'étude (taux de réponse de 12,1 % pour l'échantillon universitaire et de 3,3 % pour l'échantillon de l'APC). Les participants désiraient une plus grande distance sociale du patient de la vignette souffrant de schizophrénie. Les scores moyens à l'IAT, bien que négatifs, n'atteignaient pas le seuil d'une taille de l'effet significative. Le contact avec le patient prédisait positivement les scores à l'IAT, mais pas l'âge, le sexe, ni le niveau de formation (résident comparé à psychiatre). Le contact avec le patient ni les attitudes implicites ne prédisaient les scores à la SDS ou à la OMS-HC. Conclusion : Les psychiatres ne différaient pas des résidents en psychiatrie à aucune mesure des attitudes explicites ou implicites à l'égard de la maladie mentale. Les attitudes explicites à l'endroit des personnes souffrant de maladie mentale étaient relativement négatives; les attitudes implicites n'étaient ni positives ni négatives; et les attitudes implicites et explicites n'étaient pas corrélées. Un plus grand contact avec le patient prédisait plus d'attitudes implicites positives, mais ne prédisait pas d'attitudes explicites.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Many people living with HIV suffer from depressive symptoms. In a previous pilot study, self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (in booklet format) was found to be effective in treating depressive symptoms in people with HIV. We developed an online self-help program in Dutch and English (based on the booklet) for people with HIV and depressive symptoms. Besides the main question regarding the effectiveness of the program aimed at lowering depressive symptoms, sub-questions will focus on the moderators of treatment success (for which patients is the program especially beneficial?) and the mechanisms of change underlying the treatment outcome (which mediators affect the outcome of treatment?). In this paper, the protocol of the study will be described.Methods/design: The effectiveness of the program will be investigated by comparing the intervention group with a waiting list-control group in a randomized controlled design, by including a pretest and three post-tests. The self-help program contains four main components: activation, relaxation, changing maladaptive cognitions, and goal attainment. Participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms will work on the program for 6 to 10 weeks, during which a coach will provide motivational support by telephone once a week. Participants in the control condition will receive weekly minimal support from a coach for 8 weeks, and after the second post-test, they can gain access to the self-help program. Depressive symptoms and possible mediators (e.g., activation, cognitive coping, self-efficacy, and goal adjustment) will be assessed by self-report three times during the intervention/waiting period and at the pretest and first post-test.Discussion: The proposed study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an online self-help intervention for people with HIV and depressive symptoms. If the intervention is shown to be effective, the program will be implemented. Consequently, many patients with HIV could be reached, and their psychological care may be improved.Trial Registration: Netherlands Trial Register: NTR5407.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Few studies targeting obesity in serious mental illness have reported clinically significant risk reduction, and none have been replicated in community settings or demonstrated sustained outcomes after intervention withdrawal. The authors sought to replicate positive health outcomes demonstrated in a previous randomized effectiveness study of the In SHAPE program across urban community mental health organizations serving an ethnically diverse population.Method: Persons with serious mental illness and a body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 receiving services in three community mental health organizations were recruited and randomly assigned either to the 12-month In SHAPE program, which included membership in a public fitness club and weekly meetings with a health promotion coach, or to fitness club membership alone. The primary outcome measures were weight and cardiorespiratory fitness (as measured with the 6-minute walk test), assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months.Results: Participants (N=210) were ethnically diverse (46% were nonwhite), with a mean baseline BMI of 36.8 (SD=8.2). At 12 months, the In SHAPE group (N=104) had greater reduction in weight and improved fitness compared with the fitness club membership only group (N=106). Primary outcomes were maintained at 18 months. Approximately half of the In SHAPE group (51% at 12 months and 46% at 18 months) achieved clinically significant cardiovascular risk reduction (a weight loss ≥5% or an increase of &gt;50 meters on the 6-minute walk test).Conclusions: This is the first replication study confirming the effectiveness of a health coaching intervention in achieving and sustaining clinically significant reductions in cardiovascular risk for overweight and obese persons with serious mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The relationship between admission volume and the quality of mental health care remains unclear. This study examined the association between admission volume of psychiatric hospital units and quality of mental health care among patients with recently diagnosed schizophrenia (past year) admitted to units in Denmark.Methods: In a nationwide population-based cohort study, 3,209 patients admitted to psychiatric hospital units between 2004 and 2011 were identified from the Danish Schizophrenia Registry. Admission volume was categorized into four quartiles according to the individual unit's average caseload volume per year during the study period: low volume (quartile 1, ≤75 admissions per year), medium volume (quartile 2, 76-146 admissions per year), high volume (quartile 3, 147-256 admissions per year) and very high volume (quartile 4, &gt;256 admissions per year). Quality of mental health care was defined as having received processes of care recommended in guidelines.Results: Compared with patients admitted to low-volume psychiatric hospital units, patients admitted to very-high-volume units were more likely to receive high overall quality of mental health care (≥80% of recommended processes of care) (risk ratio [RR]=1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03-1.91) and to receive several specific processes of care, including assessment of psychopathology by a specialist in psychiatry (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.10) and psychoeducation (RR=1.16, CI=1.05-1.28). Moreover, patients admitted to high-volume units were more likely to have a suicide risk assessment at discharge (RR=1.14, CI=1.07-1.21).Conclusions: Admission to very-high-volume and high-volume psychiatric hospital units was associated with a greater chance of receiving guideline-recommended processes of care among patients admitted with recently diagnosed schizophrenia.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The robustness of epidemiological research using routinely collected primary care electronic data to support policy and practice for common mental disorders (CMD) anxiety and depression would be greatly enhanced by appropriate validation of diagnostic codes and algorithms for data extraction. We aimed to create a robust research platform for CMD using population-based, routinely collected primary care electronic data.Methods: We developed a set of Read code lists (diagnosis, symptoms, treatments) for the identification of anxiety and depression in the General Practice Database (GPD) within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank at Swansea University, and assessed 12 algorithms for Read codes to define cases according to various criteria. Annual incidence rates were calculated per 1000 person years at risk (PYAR) to assess recording practice for these CMD between January 1(st) 2000 and December 31(st) 2009. We anonymously linked the 2799 MHI-5 Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Survey (CHSNS) respondents aged 18 to 74 years to their routinely collected GP data in SAIL. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the various algorithms using the MHI-5 as the gold standard.Results: The incidence of combined depression/anxiety diagnoses remained stable over the ten-year period in a population of over 500,000 but symptoms increased from 6.5 to 20.7 per 1000 PYAR. A 'historical' GP diagnosis for depression/anxiety currently treated plus a current diagnosis (treated or untreated) resulted in a specificity of 0.96, sensitivity 0.29 and PPV 0.76. Adding current symptom codes improved sensitivity (0.32) with a marginal effect on specificity (0.95) and PPV (0.74).Conclusions: We have developed an algorithm with a high specificity and PPV of detecting cases of anxiety and depression from routine GP data that incorporates symptom codes to reflect GP coding behaviour. We have demonstrated that using diagnosis and current treatment alone to identify cases for depression and anxiety using routinely collected primary care data will miss a number of true cases given changes in GP recording behaviour. The Read code lists plus the developed algorithms will be applicable to other routinely collected primary care datasets, creating a platform for future e-cohort research into these conditions.</ab>

        <ab>To date there have been few peer-reviewed studies on the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of digital technologies for mental health promotion and disorder prevention. Any evaluation of these evolving technologies is complicated by a lack of understanding about the specific risks and possible benefits of the many forms of internet use on mental health. To adequately meet the mental health needs of today's society, psychiatry must engage in rigorous assessment of the impact of digital technologies.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Chronic insomnia is a prevalent disorder associated with significant psychosocial, health, and economic impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BzRA) medications are the most widely supported therapeutic approaches for insomnia management. However, few investigations have directly compared their relative and combined benefits, and even fewer have tested the benefits of sequential treatment for those who do not respond to initial insomnia therapy. Moreover, insomnia treatment studies have been limited by small, highly screened study samples, fixed-dose, and fixed-agent pharmacotherapy strategies that do not represent usual clinical practices. This study will address these limitations.Methods/design: This is a two-site randomized controlled trial, which will enroll 224 adults who meet the criteria for a chronic insomnia disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders. Prospective participants will complete clinical assessments and polysomnography and then will be randomly assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem. Treatment outcomes will be assessed after 6 weeks, and treatment remitters will be followed for the next 12 months on maintenance therapy. Those not achieving remission will be offered randomization to a second, 6-week treatment, again involving either pharmacotherapy (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy (CT)). All participants will be re-evaluated 12 weeks after the protocol initiation and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Insomnia remission, defined categorically as a score &lt; 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index, a patient-reported outcome, will serve as the primary endpoint for treatment comparisons. Secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters derived from daily sleep diaries and from polysomnography, subjective measures of fatigue, mood, quality of life, and functional impairments; and measures of adverse events; dropout rates; and treatment acceptability. Centrally trained therapists will administer therapies according to manualized, albeit flexible, treatment algorithms.Discussion: This clinical trial will provide new information about optimal treatment sequencing and will have direct implication for the development of clinical guidelines for managing chronic insomnia with and without comorbid psychiatric conditions.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01651442 , Protocol version 4, 20 April 2011, registered 26 June 2012.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors compared early-career psychiatrists' selection of psychological treatments for patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) in the US and Japan.Methods: A total of 120 early-career psychiatrists from two residency programs in the US and Japan participated in web-based surveys. The psychiatrists selected first- and second-line psychological treatments in response to two case vignettes of patients with mild and moderate MDD.Results: Eighty-one psychiatrists (68%) returned the surveys, of whom 39 (48%) were American and 42 (52%) Japanese. In response to the mild MDD case, more US psychiatrists selected high-intensity psychological treatments (P &lt; 0.001), whereas more Japanese psychiatrists selected low-intensity psychological treatments (P &lt; 0.001). In both countries, more psychiatrists selected psychological treatment than medication. In response to the moderate MDD case, one third of the US psychiatrists selected high-intensity psychological treatments (P &lt; 0.001), whereas half of the Japanese psychiatrists selected low-intensity psychological treatments (P = 0.010).Conclusions: Residency training, availability of psychological treatments, and cultural beliefs may shape differences in treatment selections, which in turn may impact the dissemination and implementation of psychological treatment in clinical practice across cultures.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: A core component of mental health courts (MHCs) is the provision of community treatment in order to reduce arrests. However, research on the components of treatment received by MHC participants is rare. This study examined the impact of community treatment on arrests in an MHC sample (N=357) and a sample from the traditional criminal justice system (N=384).Methods: Data were from the MacArthur MHC Project, which includes objective and subjective information from four MHCs with comparison samples at each site. Interview data were collected for six months before and six months after entry into the MHC or legal system. National data from arrest records over one year were also obtained. Treatment-related variables were compliance (appointments and medication), perceptions (motivation and perceived voluntariness), and use of nine types of community treatment. A fixed-effects regression controlled for selection bias between groups.Results: The regression model indicated significant increases in treatment motivation and use of community mental health and substance abuse services among MHC participants, compared with treatment-as-usual participants; however, the perceived voluntariness of treatment decreased in the MHC group. For the treatment-as-usual group, none of the treatment variables were associated with future arrest. For the MHC group, increased medication compliance and use of mental health services were associated with a significant decrease in arrests.Conclusions: Consistent with the MHC goals, findings indicated increases in receipt of community treatment among MHC participants. For the MHC sample, but not the treatment-as-usual sample, increased treatment was associated with reduced recidivism.</ab>

        <ab>Background: To make informed choices, patients need information about negative as well as positive effects of treatments. There is little information about negative effects of psychological interventions.Aims: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for perceived negative effects of psychological treatment for common mental disorders.Method: Cross-sectional survey of people receiving psychological treatment from 184 services in England and Wales. Respondents were asked whether they had experienced lasting bad effects from the treatment they received.Results: Of 14 587 respondents, 763 (5.2%) reported experiencing lasting bad effects. People aged over 65 were less likely to report such effects and sexual and ethnic minorities were more likely to report them. People who were unsure what type of therapy they received were more likely to report negative effects (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI 1.22-1.87), and those that stated that they were given enough information about therapy before it started were less likely to report them (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.54-0.79).Conclusions: One in 20 people responding to this survey reported lasting bad effects from psychological treatment. Clinicians should discuss the potential for both the positive and negative effects of therapy before it starts.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Elevated depressive symptoms that do not reach criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depression are highly prevalent in persons with diabetes. This study was aimed at determining the efficacy of psychoeducation and physical exercise compared with enhanced treatment as usual on 1-year changes in depressive symptoms, diabetes distress and self-management, and quality of life and metabolic control in type 2 diabetes patients with subsyndromal depression.Methods: Adult type 2 diabetes patients who screened positively for depression and expressed a need for professional help with mood-related issues were eligible. Exclusion criteria were clinical depression, current psychiatric treatment and advanced diabetes complications. Out of 365 eligible patients 209 consented to either 6 weekly sessions of psychoeducation (A) and physical exercise (B), or to enhanced treatment as usual (C). Computer-generated sequences for block randomisation stratified by gender were used. Depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and diabetes distress, diabetes self-care, metabolic control and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) were analysed at 6-month and 12-month follow-up using repeated-measures ANOVAs.Results: Out of the 74 patients randomised into group A, 66 into B and 69 into group C, 203 completed the interventions, and 179 patients with all 3 assessments were analysed. Depressive symptoms in participants from the psychoeducational, physical exercise and the enhanced treatment as usual groups improved equally from baseline to 12-month follow-up (time versus time x group effect; F = 12.51, p &lt; 0.001, η(2) = 0.07 and F = 0.609, p = 0.656, η(2) = 0.007 respectively), as did diabetes distress and quality of life (all p &lt; 0.001), diabetes self-care (p &lt; 0.001 to &lt; 0.05), triglycerides, and total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001).Conclusions: The employed interventions had comparable positive effects on 12-month psychological and diabetes-related outcomes suggesting that even minimal intervention addressing patients' diabetes-related problems and concerns had favourable clinical implications and might be sufficient to treat subsyndromal depression. Further investigation is warranted to clarify possible mechanisms of improvement.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN05673017.

        <ab>Background: Primary care patients and clinicians may prefer options other than second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The comparative benefits and harms of antidepressants and alternative treatments are unclear.Purpose: To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants and psychological, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and exercise treatments as first- and second-step interventions for adults with acute MDD.Data Sources: English-, German-, and Italian-language studies from multiple electronic databases (January 1990 to September 2015); trial registries and gray-literature databases were used to identify unpublished research.Study Selection: Two investigators independently selected comparative randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration on health outcomes of adult outpatients; nonrandomized studies were eligible for harms.Data Extraction: Reviewers abstracted data on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes; rated the risk of bias; and graded the strength of evidence. A senior reviewer confirmed data and ratings.Data Synthesis: 45 trials met inclusion criteria. On the basis of moderate-strength evidence, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants led to similar response rates (relative risk [RR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.07]) and remission rates (RR, 0.98 [CI, 0.73 to 1.32]). In trials, antidepressants had higher risks for adverse events than most other treatment options; no information from nonrandomized studies was available. The evidence was too limited to make firm conclusions about differences in the benefits and harms of antidepressants compared with other treatment options as first-step therapies for acute MDD. For second-step therapies, different switching and augmentation strategies provided similar symptom relief.Limitation: High dropout rates, dosing inequalities, small sample sizes, and poor assessment of adverse events limit confidence in the evidence.Conclusion: Given their similar efficacy, CBT and antidepressants are both viable choices for initial treatment of MDD.Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.</ab>

        <ab>Background To evaluate and compare 6-month effects of 8 weeks of an integrative treatment (IT), therapeutic acupuncture (TA), and conventional treatment (CT) in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and in improving health-related quality of life (HRQL) and sense of coherence (SOC) in psychologically distressed primary care patients. Methods Patients who had participated in an open, pragmatic randomized controlled trial were followed up six months after treatment. The study sample consisted of 120 adults (40 per treatment arm) aged 20 to 55 years referred from four different primary health care centres in western Sweden for psychological distress. Assessments were made at baseline after eight weeks and after 24 weeks. Anxiety and depression were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), HRQL with the SF-36 Mental Component Summary scores (MCS) and SOC with the Sense of Coherence-13 questionnaire. Results No baseline differences were found between groups on any outcome variable. At 24 weeks, IT and TA had significantly better values than CT on all variables. All three groups showed significant improvements from baseline on all variables, except HAD depression in CT; however, improvements were significantly greater in IT and TA than in CT. IT and TA did not differ on any outcome variable. Effect sizes were large in IT and TA for all variables and small or moderate in CT. Improvements on all variables seen after 8-weeks of IT and TA remained stable at 24 weeks and the CT group improved on HAD anxiety. Conclusions IT and TA seem to be more beneficial than CT in reducing anxiety, depression, and in improving quality of life and sense of coherence after 24 weeks of follow up in patients with psychological distress. More research is needed to confirm these results.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined the demographic, diagnostic, and service characteristics of veterans who received services for "other psychological or physical stress, not elsewhere classified" (ICD-9-CM V62.89) in the month following a suicide attempt.Methods: An electronic search of a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) suicide event reporting system identified 22,701 veterans who were survivors of a suicide attempt. Their clinical service encounter records were extracted from a VHA administrative database to identify those who received services related to V62.89.Results: Services related to V62.89 were provided to N=2,173 (9.6%) of the sample. Chaplains were the predominant service provider, identified in N=1,745 (80%) of the service encounters. Differences were noted between those who received services related to V62.89 from a chaplain or from another service provider.Conclusions: V62.89 appears to be a focus of clinical concern for some veteran suicide attempt survivors. Additional research is needed to better understand any implications for suicide "postvention."</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cancer patients who have reached the terminal stage despite attempts at treatment are likely to experience various problems, particularly as they encounter increasing difficulty in doing what they were able to do easily, and their physical symptoms increase as the disease advances. The purpose of this study is to explore how terminal cancer patients who have not clearly expressed a depressed mood or intense grief manage their feelings associated with anxiety and depression. Methods: Eleven terminally ill patients with cancer who were receiving symptom-relieving treatment at home or in palliative care units were interviewed. Interviews were generally conducted weekly, two to five times for each participant. In total, 33 interviews were conducted, and the overall interview time was 2027 min. Data were analyzed via qualitative methods. Results: The following five themes were extracted regarding the experience of managing feelings associated with anxiety and depression when facing death: "I have to accept that I have developed cancer," "I have to accept the undeniable approach of my own death," "I have to accept my need for assistance," "I have to accept this unsatisfactory circumstance" and "I have to accept this as my destiny and an outcome of my life." Conclusion: The present study revealed key themes related to how patients come to terms with their impending death. Nurses are required to comprehend the patients' complicated mental patterns that are expressed in their daily languages. Furthermore, the findings clarify the necessity for nurses to help patients understand the acceptance of a terminal disease state during a patient's final days.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Positive Mental Health (PMH) instrument was developed and validated to assess the level of PMH and its six dimensions in a multi-ethnic general population sample. This cross-sectional study examines the psychometric properties of the instrument for assessing the level of PMH among help-seeking patients with mental disorders.Methods: The PMH instrument was tested among 360 out-patients with schizophrenia, depression or anxiety spectrum disorders, seeking treatment at a tertiary psychiatric hospital and its affiliated clinics in Singapore. All participants completed the PMH instrument along with measures of life satisfaction, mental and overall health and happiness. Reliability (internal consistency), construct (Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM)) and criterion (convergent and divergent) validity of the PMH instrument were tested in this population. Items were also tested for item response theory and differential item functioning (IRT-DIF).Results: ESEM on the PMH instrument showed good fit with the model reflecting six factors (general coping, personal growth and autonomy, spirituality, interpersonal skills, emotional support, and global affect). Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha &gt;0.85) for the instrument and its six subscales. The PMH instrument fulfilled expected correlations with related constructs and demonstrated adequate item discrimination and difficulty estimates; however, significant DIF was noted for few items for age, gender and ethnicity groups.Conclusions: The PMH instrument is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring PMH dimensions in patients with mental disorders. Further studies in larger samples are needed to assess the impact of DIF on PMH scores. The implications for the shift in focus from just the negative aspects of mental disorders to including positive components in the assessment of patients with mental disorders are immense, and can be applied in routine mental health practice and policy making.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES This multisite study aimed to answer the following research questions about women in urban and rural jails. First, what is the current and lifetime prevalence of serious mental illness (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders) of women in jail? Second, what level of impairment is associated with their serious mental illness? Third, what is the proportion of incarcerated women with serious mental illness who also have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a substance use disorder, or both? METHODS Participants were 491 women randomly sampled in jails in Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, and the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. Structured interviews assessed lifetime and 12-month prevalence of disorders and level of impairment. RESULTS Forty-three percent of participants met lifetime criteria for a serious mental illness, and 32% met 12-month criteria; among the latter, 45% endorsed severe functional impairment. Fifty-three percent met criteria for ever having PTSD. Almost one in three (29%) met criteria for a serious mental illness and PTSD, 38% for a serious mental illness and a co-occurring substance use disorder, and about one in four (26%) for all three in their lifetime. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of serious mental illness and its co-occurrence with substance use disorders and PTSD in this multisite sample suggest the critical need for comprehensive assessment of mental health at the point of women's entry into the criminal justice system and the necessity for more programs that offer alternatives to incarceration and that can address the complexity of female offenders' treatment needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer has many known and distressing side effects. The efficacy of group interventions for reducing psychological morbidity is lacking. This study investigated the relative benefits of a group nurse-led intervention on psychological morbidity, unmet needs, treatment-related concerns and prostate cancer-specific quality of life in men receiving curative intent radiotherapy for prostate cancer.Methods: This phase III, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial included 331 men (consent rate: 72 %; attrition: 5 %) randomised to the intervention (n = 166) or usual care (n = 165). The intervention comprised four group and one individual consultation all delivered by specialist uro-oncology nurses. Primary outcomes were anxious and depressive symptoms as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Unmet needs were assessed with the Supportive Care Needs Survey-SF34 Revised, treatment-related concerns with the Cancer Treatment Scale and quality of life with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index -26. Assessments occurred before, at the end of and 6 months post-radiotherapy. Primary outcome analysis was by intention-to-treat and performed by fitting a linear mixed model to each outcome separately using all observed data.Results: Mixed models analysis indicated that group consultations had a significant beneficial effect on one of two primary endpoints, depressive symptoms (p = 0.009), and one of twelve secondary endpoints, procedural concerns related to cancer treatment (p = 0.049). Group consultations did not have a significant beneficial effect on generalised anxiety, unmet needs and prostate cancer-specific quality of life.Conclusions: Compared with individual consultations offered as part of usual care, the intervention provides a means of delivering patient education and is associated with modest reductions in depressive symptoms and procedural concerns. Future work should seek to confirm the clinical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of group interventions.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ANZCTRN012606000184572 . 1 March 2006.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) has recently been included in the appendix of DSM-5 as a condition for further study. This study compared public stigma associated with four mental health conditions among study participants in Hong Kong.Methods: The cross-sectional study involved 204 participants (154 members of the general public general public and 50 health care professionals) recruited through a public awareness campaign and the e-mail network of the University of Hong Kong. Participants read four vignettes describing persons with schizophrenia, depression, APS, or psychosis-like experiences. For each vignette, they used a scale to rate their level of stigma in seven domains: social distance, traditional prejudice, exclusionary sentiments, negative affect, perceptions of dangerousness, treatment carryover, and disclosure carryover. Analyses compared ratings within and across vignettes.Results: Schizophrenia received the highest public stigma ratings, followed by APS, depression, and psychosis-like experiences. Total stigma scores were higher for the general public than for health care professionals. Public stigma associated with APS was similar to that associated with depression. Ratings of treatment carryover indicated that participants believed that being known to have received treatment for APS or depression would have lasting consequences.Conclusions: Stigma should be considered in the development of mental health services and research in China, particularly in regard to people with schizophrenia and those at risk of psychosis.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The importance of accessible mental health treatment is a global concern, particularly when one in five people will experience a mental health problem in their lifespan. This is no less important in Ghana; however, no studies have yet attempted to appraise and synthesise the potential enablers and barriers to accessing services in Ghana. The aim of this integrative review is therefore to identify and synthesise existing evidence on the barriers and enablers to accessing mental health services in Ghana.Methods: A search of the published literature was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The search was limited to papers published in English and within 2000-2018. Using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved papers. A data extraction form and a Critical Appraisal Checklist were used to extract and appraise data, respectively. The integrative review incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data into a single synthesis.Results: Out of 42 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 50% used qualitative methods, 33.3% used mixed methods and 16.7% used quantitative methods alone. The potential barriers in accessing mental health services were attitudinal, knowledge about services, treatment cost, transportation and geographical proximity, as well as perceived efficacy of medication. Similarly, the health systems factors contributing to barriers were low priority, limited funding sources, irregular medicine supply, limited services for marginalised groups and poor state of psychiatric facilities, together with poor management of mental health cadres. The potential enablers for service users involved increased decentralisation and integration, task-shifting and existing support services.Conclusion: The existing evidence on mental health in Ghana is skewed towards weaknesses in the systems and stigma, with rationally little, or no, evidence or emphasis on the effectiveness, or quality of mental health services. These attributes largely neglect the provision of psychiatric services for marginalised mental health service user groups, including children, adolescents, people with disabilities and the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Aggression, hyperactivity, impulsivity, helplessness and anhedonia are all signs of depressive-like disorders in humans and are often reported to be present in animal models of depression induced by stress or by inflammatory challenges. However, chronic mild stress (CMS) and clinically silent inflammation, during the recovery period after an infection, for example, are often coincident, but comparison of the behavioural and molecular changes that underpin CMS vs a mild inflammatory challenge and impact of the combined challenge is largely unexplored. Here, we examined whether stress-induced behavioural and molecular responses are analogous to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced behavioural and molecular effects and whether their combination is adaptive or maladaptive.Methods: Changes in measures of hedonic sensitivity, helplessness, aggression, impulsivity and CNS and systemic cytokine and 5-HT-system-related gene expression were investigated in C57BL/6J male mice exposed to chronic stress alone, low-dose LPS alone or a combination of LPS and stress.Results: When combined with a low dose of LPS, chronic stress resulted in an enhanced depressive-like phenotype but significantly reduced manifestations of aggression and hyperactivity. At the molecular level, LPS was a strong inducer of TNFα, IL-1β and region-specific 5-HT2A mRNA expression in the brain. There was also increased serum corticosterone as well as increased TNFα expression in the liver. Stress did not induce comparable levels of cytokine expression to an LPS challenge, but the combination of stress with LPS reduced the stress-induced changes in 5-HT genes and the LPS-induced elevated IL-1β levels.Conclusions: It is evident that when administered independently, both stress and LPS challenges induced distinct molecular and behavioural changes. However, at a time when LPS alone does not induce any overt behavioural changes per se, the combination with stress exacerbates depressive and inhibits aggressive behaviours.</ab>

        <ab>The quality of psychosocial treatment delivery is highly variable in community practice settings, even among well-trained providers. This column discusses the potential to improve patient outcomes by targeting two important quality-of-care indicators through technology: provider fidelity and children's engagement. A case example describes one provider's use of numerous tablet-based activities in the context of evidence-based psychotherapy. Providers and families responded favorably to this approach in a recent feasibility study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Further research is needed to determine whether this approach may improve outcomes, quality of care, provider fidelity, and patient engagement in community mental health service settings.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Elevated rates of affective disturbance in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) have been reported. However, it remains unclear how anxiety and depression are related to epilepsy, and it is unknown whether these mood disorders are influenced by the use of antiepileptic drugs. In the present report, we performed a prospective study designed to evaluate affective disorders (anxiety and depression) without the bias of antiepileptic drug treatment in 89 children with BCECTS, based on self-reporting. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether clinical factors, such as age, disease course, seizure frequency, and spike wave index (SWI), were related to the psychological profiles.Methods: Patients with BCECTS (n = 89) and healthy matched controls (n = 75) were included in this study. The Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC) and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) were completed by the children.Results: None of the children met criteria for clinically significant anxiety or depression. However, the children with BCECTS had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores compared with children in the control group. We found no significant differences in depression or anxiety between the left, right, and bilateral lobe groups. The DSRSC scores were similar between the children with partial seizures and those with secondarily generalized seizures. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the SCARED scores between these two groups. However, the DSRSC and SCARED scores were positively correlated with age, seizure frequency, SWI, and disease course.Conclusions: The children with BCECTS had an increased likelihood of depression and anxiety, and these higher rates were unrelated to seizure type or epileptic focus, but were positively correlated with age, seizure frequency, SWI, and disease course.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mental disorders strongly influence work capability in young adults, but it is not clear which disorders that are most strongly associated with sick leave, and which diagnoses that are stated on the sick leave certificates. Better knowledge of the impairments associated with different mental disorders is needed for optimal planning of interventions and prioritization of health services. In the current study, we investigate the prospective associations between eight mood, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders, and later sick leave granted for mental, somatic, or any disorder.Methods: Lifetime mental disorders were assessed by structured diagnostic interviews in 2,178 young adults followed for eight years with registry data on sick leave. Relative risk ratios were estimated for the associations between each mental disorder and the different forms of sick leave.Results: All included diagnoses were associated with later sick leave. In adjusted analyses, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were the strongest predictors of sick leave granted for mental disorders, whereas social anxiety disorder and specific phobia were the strongest predictors of sick leave granted for somatic disorders. Specific phobia and major depressive disorder had the highest attributable fractions for all-cause sick leave.Conclusions: Mood and anxiety disorders constituted independent risk factors for all cause sick leave, whereas alcohol use disorders seemed to be of less importance in young adulthood. Disorders characterised by distress were most strongly associated with sick leave granted for mental disorders, whereas disorders characterised by fear primarily predicted sick leave granted for somatic conditions. A large part of all sick leave is related to specific phobia, due to the high prevalence of this disorder. The impairment associated with this common disorder may be under-acknowledged, and it could decrease work capacity among individuals with somatic disorders. This disorder has good treatment response and may be overlooked as a target for interventions aimed at prevention of sick leave.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Prior research found preliminary effectiveness for Burnout Reduction: Enhanced Awareness, Tools, Handouts, and Education (BREATHE), a daylong workshop for reducing burnout among behavioral health providers. Using a longer follow-up compared with prior research, this study compared the effectiveness of BREATHE and a control condition.Methods: Behavioral health providers (N=145) from three U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and two social service agencies were randomly assigned to BREATHE or person-centered treatment planning. Burnout and other outcomes were compared across groups over time.Results: Analyses yielded no significant differences between groups. However, BREATHE participants showed small but statistically significant improvements in cynicism (six weeks) and in emotional exhaustion and positive expectations for clients (six months). Participants in the control condition showed no significant changes over time.Conclusions: Although it did not demonstrate comparative effectiveness versus a control condition, BREATHE could be strengthened and targeted toward both distressed providers and their organizations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is a multifactorial condition, which can be mentally and physically compromising both during and after pregnancy. However, long-term pregnancy-related PGP has been poorly investigated. This longitudinal follow-up study uniquely aimed to describe prevalence and predictors of PGP and its consequences on women's health and function up to 11 years after pregnancy.Methods/design: A postal questionnaire was sent to 530 women who participated in 1 of 3 randomized controlled studies for PGP in pregnancy. Women who reported experiencing lumbopelvic pain were offered a clinical examination. Main outcome measure was the presence of long term PGP as assessed by an independent examiner. Secondary outcomes were: working hours/week, function (the Disability Rating Index, and Oswestry Disability Index), self-efficacy (the General Self-Efficacy Scale), HRQL (Euro-Qol 5D and EQ-Visual scale), anxiety and depression, (Hospital anxiety and depression scale,) and pain-catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), in women with PGP compared to women with no PGP.Results: A total of 371/530 (70 %) women responded and 37/ 371 (10 %) were classified with long-term PGP. Pregnancy-related predictors for long-term PGP were number of positive pain provocation tests (OR = 1.79), history of low back pain (LBP) (OR = 2.28), positive symphysis pressure test (OR = 2.01), positive Faber (Patrick's) test (OR = 2.22), and positive modified Trendelenburg test (OR = 2.20). Women with PGP had significantly decreased ability to perform daily activities (p &lt; .001), lower self-efficacy (p = 0.046), decreased HRQL (p &lt; .001), higher levels of anxiety and depression (p &lt; .001), were more prone to pain catastrophizing, and worked significantly fewer hours/week (p = 0.032) compared to women with no PGP.Conclusions: This unique long-term follow up of PGP highlights the importance of assessment of pain in the lumbopelvic area early in pregnancy and postpartum in order to identify women with risk of long term pain. One of 10 women with PGP in pregnancy has severe consequences up to 11 years later. They could be identified by number of positive pain provocation tests and experience of previous LBP. Access to evidence based treatments are important for individual and socioeconomic reasons.</ab>

        <ab>This observational study investigated the outcomes of a community-based rehabilitation program that was designed to enhance social functioning, social inclusion, and well-being of people with mental illness who were considered treatment failures by psychiatric professionals in Italy. Of the 144 patients who entered the program, 131 started the program and 109 completed either 12 or 18 months of treatment. Illness severity was assessed by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) and social functioning by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). On the HoNOS, 33% of patients showed reliable change. On the SOFAS, 27% showed reliable change, although the change was substantial for few patients. Over time, patients showed moderate but significant improvements on the HoNOS and SOFAS. The HoNOS subscales concerning interpersonal relationships and social inclusion showed significant change. Very isolated people with mental illness gained some advantages from this rehabilitation program that was based on a close relationship with a key worker; however, the program duration may have been inadequate to produce substantial changes. Our findings warrant further research based on controlled studies.</ab>

        <ab>Background: People who are diagnosed with both mental and chronic medical illness present unique challenges for the health care system. In resource-limited settings, such as rural India, people with depression and anxiety are often under-served, due to both stigma and lack of trained providers and resources. These challenges can lead to complications in the management of chronic disease as well as increased suffering for patients, families and communities. In this study, we evaluate the effects of integrating mental health and chronic disease treatment of patients in primary health care (PHC) settings using a collaborative care model to improve the screening, diagnosis and treatment of depression in rural India. Methods: This study is a multi-level randomized controlled trial among patients with depression or anxiety and co-morbid diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. Aim 1 examines whether patients screened at community health-fairs are more likely to be diagnosed and treated for these co-morbid conditions than patients screened after presenting at PHCs. Aim 2 evaluates the impact of collaborative care compared to usual care in a cluster RCT, randomizing at the level of the PHCs. Intervention arm PHC staff are trained in mental health diagnoses, treatment, and the collaborative care model. The intervention also involves community-based “Healthy Living groups” co-led by Ashas, using cognitive-behavioral strategies to promote healthy behaviors. The primary outcome is severity of common mental disorders, with secondary outcomes being diabetes and cardiovascular risk, staff knowledge and patient perceptions. Discussion: If effective, our results will contribute to the field in five ways: 1) expand on implementation research in low resource settings by examining how multiple chronic diseases can be treated using integrated low-cost, evidence-based strategies, 2) build the capacity of PHC staff to diagnose and treat mental illness within their existing clinic structure and strengthen referral linkages; 3) link community members to primary care through community-based health fairs and healthy living groups; 4) increase mental health awareness in the community and reduce mental health stigma; 5) demonstrate the potential for intervention scale-up and sustainability.

        <ab>Background: Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) are highly prevalent and are associated with frequent health care use (HCU). MUPS frequently co-occur with psychiatric disorders. With this study we examined the longitudinal association between MUPS and HCU over 2 years and the influence of depressive and anxiety disorders and personality traits on this association.Methods: We analysed follow-up data from 2045 to 2981 participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), a multisite cohort study. The study population included participants with a current depressive and/or anxiety disorder, participants with a lifetime risk and/or subthreshold symptoms for depressive and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls. HCU, measured with the Trimbos and iMTA questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness (TIC-P), was operationalized as the number of used medical services and the number of associated contacts. MUPS were measured with the Four Dimensional Symptoms Questionnaire, depressive and anxiety disorders with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and personality traits with the NEO Five-Factory Inventory. Measurements were taken at baseline, 1 and 2 years follow-up. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE), using HCU at all three measurements as (multivariate) outcome. GEE also takes into account the dependency of observations within participants.Results: MUPS were positively associated with HCU over 2 years (medical services: RR 1.020, 95 % CI 1.017-1.022; contacts: RR 1.037, 95 % CI 1.030-1.044). Neuroticism and depression had the strongest influence on the associations. After adjustment for these factors, the associations between MUPS and HCU weakened, but remained significant (services: RR 1.011, 95 % CI 1.008-1.014; contacts: RR 1.023, 95 % CI 1.015-1.032).Conclusions: Our results show that MUPS were positively associated with HCU over 2 years, even after adjusting for depressive and anxiety disorders and personality traits.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for adults have compared the effectiveness of a well-specified psychotherapy and a culturally adapted version of the same treatment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT) in treating depressed Chinese-American adults.Methods: This RCT treated 50 Chinese Americans who met criteria for major depression and sought treatment at community mental health clinics. Screening of participants began in September 2008, and the last assessment was conducted in March 2011. Participants were stratified by whether they were already taking antidepressants when they first came to the clinic and randomly assigned to 12 sessions of CBT or CA-CBT. The study did not influence regular prescription practices. The primary outcomes were dropout rates and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores at baseline, session 4, session 8, and session 12.Results: Participants in CA-CBT demonstrated a greater overall decrease in depressive symptoms compared with participants in CBT, but the groups had similarly high depression rates at week 12. Differences in dropout rates for the two groups approached, but did not meet, statistical significance (7%, CA-CBT; 26%, CBT).Conclusions: Chinese Americans entered this study with very severe depression. Participants in both CBT and CA-CBT demonstrated significant decreases in depressive symptoms, but the majority did not reach remission. Results suggest that these short-term treatments were not sufficient to address such severe depression and that more intensive and longer treatments may be needed. Results also indicate that cultural adaptations may confer additional treatment benefits.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There are limited data on detection disparities of common mental disorders in minority ethnic women.Aims: Describe the natural history of common mental disorders in primary care in the maternal period, characterise women with, and explore ethnic disparities in, detected and potentially missed common mental disorders.Method: Secondary analyses of linked birth cohort and primary care data involving 8991 (39.4% White British) women in Bradford. Common mental disorders were characterised through indications in the electronic medical record. Potentially missed common mental disorders were defined as an elevated General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) score during pregnancy with no corresponding common mental disorder markers in the medical record.Results: Estimated prevalence of pre-birth common mental disorders was 9.5%, rising to 14.0% 3 years postnatally. Up to half of cases were potentially missed. Compared with White British women, minority ethnic women were twice as likely to have potentially missed common mental disorders and half as likely to have a marker of screening for common mental disorders.Conclusions: Common mental disorder detection disparities exist for minority ethnic women in the maternal period.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: We evaluated whether heavy alcohol use, illicit drug use or high levels of anxiety, and depression symptoms were modifiers of the retention through enhanced personal contact intervention. The intervention had previously demonstrated overall efficacy in the parent study.Design: Randomized trial.Methods: A total of 1838 patients from six US HIV clinics were enrolled into a randomized trial in which intervention patients received an 'enhanced contact' protocol for 12 months. All participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview that measured depression and anxiety symptoms from the Brief Symptom Inventory, alcohol use from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption instrument, and drug use from the WHO (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test) questions. The 12-month binary outcome was completing an HIV primary care visit in three consecutive 4-month intervals. The outcome was compared between intervention and standard of care patients within subgroups on the effect modifier variables using log-binomial regression models.Results: Persons with high levels of anxiety or depression symptoms and those reporting illicit drug use, or heavy alcohol consumption had no response to the intervention. Patients without these 'higher risk' characteristics responded significantly to the intervention. Further analysis revealed higher risk patients were less likely to have successfully received the telephone contact component of the intervention. Among higher risk patients who did successfully receive this component, the intervention effect was significant.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that clinic-based retention-in-care interventions are able to have significant effects on HIV patients with common behavioral health issues, but the design of those interventions should assure successful delivery of intervention components to increase effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Survivors of intensive care are known to be at increased risk of developing longer-term psychopathology issues. We present a large UK multicentre study assessing the anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caseness in the first year following discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU).Methods: Design: prospective multicentre follow-up study of survivors of ICU in the UK.Setting: patients from 26 ICUs in the UK.Inclusion Criteria: patients who had received at least 24 h of level 3 ICU care and were 16 years of age or older.Interventions: postal follow up: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Check List-Civilian (PCL-C) at 3 and 12 months following discharge from ICU.Main Outcome Measure: caseness of anxiety, depression and PTSD, 2-year survival.Results: In total, 21,633 patients admitted to ICU were included in the study. Postal questionnaires were sent to 13,155 survivors; of these 38% (4943/13155) responded and 55% (2731/4943) of respondents passed thresholds for one or more condition at 3 or 12 months following discharge. Caseness prevalence was 46%, 40% and 22% for anxiety, depression and PTSD respectively; 18% (870/4943 patients) met the caseness threshold for all three psychological conditions. Patients with symptoms of depression were 47% more likely to die during the first 2 years after discharge from ICU than those without (HR 1.47, CI 1.19-1.80).Conclusions: Over half of those who respond to postal questionnaire following treatment on ICU in the UK reported significant symptoms of anxiety, depression or PTSD. When symptoms of one psychological disorder are present, there is a 65% chance they will co-occur with symptoms of one of the other two disorders. Depression following critical illness is associated with an increased mortality risk in the first 2 years following discharge from ICU.Trial Registration: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN69112866 .

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with enrollment in a cost-sharing exemption program among people newly diagnosed as having schizophrenia.Methods: The study used a nationally representative sample from Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program. Enrollment in a cost-sharing exemption program among 1,824 individuals with schizophrenia was observed for one year and three years after the individuals received a diagnosis of schizophrenia for the first time. Generalized estimating equations were applied to estimate the effect of various patient and physician characteristics on the odds of enrollment.Results: The one-year and three-year program enrollment rates were 52% and 58%, respectively. People ages 35 or older were significantly more likely to enroll compared with younger people. People with low incomes and people who were hospitalized for schizophrenia were significantly more likely to enroll. Regarding provider characteristics, patients cared for by psychiatrists (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.10) or by psychiatric institutions (AOR=1.10) were significantly more likely to enroll in the cost-sharing exemption program within the first year of diagnosis.Conclusions: The results suggest that enrollment in the NHI's cost-sharing exemption program by people newly diagnosed as having schizophrenia was relatively low. The role of providers must not be overlooked. Effective strategies targeting high-risk subgroups for nonparticipation are necessary in addressing mental health parity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The prevalence of depressive disorder in adults with advanced cancer is around 20 %. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended for depression and may be beneficial in depressed people with cancer, its use for depression in those with advanced disease for whom cure is not likely has not been explored.Methods: People aged 18 years and above with advanced cancer attending General Practitioner (GP), oncology or hospice outpatients from centres across England will be screened to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. Self-referral is also accepted. Eligible consenters will be randomised to a single blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of the addition to treatment as usual (TAU) of up to 12 one-hour weekly sessions of manualised CBT versus TAU alone. Sessions are delivered in primary care through Increasing Access to Psychological Care (IAPT) service, and the manual includes a focus on issues for people approaching the end of life. The main outcome is the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Subsidiary measures include the Patient Health Questionnaire, quality of life measure EQ-5D, Satisfaction with care, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status and a modified Client Service Receipt Inventory. At 90 % power, we require 240 participants to enter the trial. Data will be analysed using multi-level (hierarchical) models for data collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. Cost effectiveness analysis will incorporate costs related to the intervention to compare overall healthcare costs and QALYs between the treatment arms. We will conduct qualitative interviews after final follow-up on patient and therapist perspectives of the therapy.Discussion: This trial will provide data on the clinical and cost effectiveness of CBT for people with advanced cancer and depression. We shall gain an understanding of the feasibility of delivering care to this group through IAPT. Our findings will provide evidence for policy-makers, commissioners and clinicians in cancer and palliative care, and in the community.Trial Registration: Controlled Trials ISRCTN07622709 , registered 15 July 2011.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors compared the effectiveness of initiating treatment with either clozapine or a standard antipsychotic among adults with evidence of treatment-resistant schizophrenia in routine clinical practice.Method: U.S. national Medicaid data from 2001 to 2009 were used to examine treatment outcomes in a cohort of patients with schizophrenia and evidence of treatment resistance that initiated clozapine (N=3,123) and in a propensity score-matched cohort that initiated a standard antipsychotic (N=3,123). Interventions were new initiation of clozapine or a standard antipsychotic medication, defined as no exposure to the new medication in the prior 365 days. The primary outcome was hospital admission for a mental disorder. Secondary outcomes included discontinuation of the index antipsychotic, use of an additional antipsychotic, incidence of serious medical conditions, and mortality.Results: Initiation of clozapine was associated with a significantly decreased rate of psychiatric hospital admission (hazard ratio=0.78, 95% CI=0.69-0.88), index antipsychotic discontinuation (hazard ratio=0.60, 95% CI=0.55-0.65), and use of an additional antipsychotic (hazard ratio=0.76, 95% CI=0.70-0.82). Clozapine was associated with significantly increased incidence of diabetes mellitus (2.8% for clozapine vs. 1.4% for standard antipsychotic; hazard ratio=1.63, 95% CI=0.98-2.70), hyperlipidemia (12.9% for clozapine vs. 8.5% for standard antipsychotic; hazard ratio=1.40, 95%CI=1.09-1.78), and intestinal obstruction (0.9% for clozapine vs. 0.3% for standard antipsychotic; hazard ratio=2.50, 95% CI=0.97-6.44).Conclusions: In adults with schizophrenia and evidence of treatment resistance, initiating clozapine compared with initiating a standard antipsychotic was associated with greater effectiveness on several important outcomes. Increasing the judicious use of clozapine is warranted together with vigilance to prevent and detect serious medical adverse effects.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Various forms of compulsory psychiatric community treatment orders (CTOs) are commonly utilized internationally. CTOs remain contentious because of the ethical implications of coercing patients to receive treatment. Understanding patients' experience of CTOs can assist in the development of more patient-centered and recovery-focused community care. This review examined the relationship between CTOs and patients' perceptions of coercion in the literature.Methods: A search of key terms relating to CTOs and patients' perceptions of coercion was conducted of relevant databases from their inception to March 31, 2014. Publications were included if they were peer reviewed, reported on original research, surveyed or interviewed patients who were or had been subject to a CTO, and were written in English. Factors influencing patients' perceptions of coercion, including the regional context of the studies, were identified.Results: Twenty-three primary research articles, reporting on 14 studies from seven countries, were included. Evidence indicated that CTOs may contribute to a patient's sense of coercion, with marked variations among studies in the levels of coercion. Contextual factors, including perceptions of alternatives to CTOs, the presence of additional forms of leverage in patients' lives, and the process of CTO initiation and enforcement, may mitigate or enhance perceptions of coercion.Conclusions: Coercive elements of CTOs may be reduced through increased patient access to information, better working relationships with service providers, and accessible, fair processes. The coercive aspects of CTOs should be seen as part of a broader understanding of the daily pressures and leverage applied in outpatient psychiatric treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: An essential element of mental health service scale up relates to an assessment of resource requirements and cost implications.Aims: To assess the expected resource needs of scaling up services in five districts in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.Method: The resource quantities associated with each site's specified care package were identified and subsequently costed, both at current and target levels of coverage.Results: The cost of the care package at target coverage ranged from US$0.21 to 0.56 per head of population in four of the districts (in the higher-income context of South Africa, it was US$1.86). In all districts, the additional amount needed each year to reach target coverage goals after 10 years was below $0.10 per head of population.Conclusions: Estimation of resource needs and costs for district-level mental health services provides relevant information concerning the financial feasibility of locally developed plans for successful scale up.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this article was to systematically compare the developmental trajectory of neurobehavior over the first postnatal month for infants with prenatal exposure to pharmacologically untreated maternal depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (collectively: SSRIs), SSRIs with concomitant benzodiazepines (SSRI plus benzodiazepine), and no maternal depression or drug treatment (no exposure).Method: Women (N=184) were assessed at two prenatal time points to determine psychiatric diagnoses, symptom severity, and prenatal medication usage. Infants were examined with a structured neurobehavioral assessment (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale) at multiple time points across the first postnatal month. SSRI exposure was confirmed in a subset of participants with plasma SSRI levels. General linear-mixed models were used to examine group differences in neurobehavioral scores over time with adjustment for demographic variables and depression severity.Results: Infants in the SSRI and SSRI plus benzodiazepine groups had lower motor scores and more CNS stress signs across the first postnatal month, as well as lower self-regulation and higher arousal at day 14. Infants in the depression group had low arousal throughout the newborn period. Infants in all three clinical groups had a widening gap in scores from the no-exposure group at day 30 in their response to visual and auditory stimuli while asleep and awake. Infants in the SSRI plus benzodiazepine group had the least favorable scores on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale.Conclusions: Neonatal adaptation syndrome was not limited to the first 2 weeks postbirth. The profile of neurobehavioral development was different for SSRI exposure than depression alone. Concomitant benzodiazepine use may exacerbate adverse behavioral effects.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To determine the risk of developing obesity and related metabolic complications in children following long-term treatment with risperidone or quetiapine.Methods: This was a 1-year naturalistic longitudinal study conducted between February 2009 and March 2012. A total of 130 children aged 2 to 18 years without prior exposure to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) were enrolled at initiation of treatment with either risperidone or quetiapine. Metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and months 6 and 12. Data of 37 participants (20 treated with risperidone and 17 treated with quetiapine) who completed 12-month monitoring were used in the analysis.Results: After 1 year of SGA treatment, mean weight increased significantly by 10.8 kg (95% CI 7.9 kg to 13.7 kg) for risperidone and 9.7 kg (95% CI 6.5 kg to 12.8 kg) for quetiapine. Body mass index z score also increased significantly in both groups (P &lt; 0.001). There was a high incidence of children becoming overweight or obese (6/15 [40.0%] for risperidone-treated and 7/14 [50.0%] for quetiapine-treated). The mean levels of fasting glucose (for risperidone-treated) and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for quetiapine-treated) increased significantly by 0.23 mmol/L (95% CI 0.03 mmol/L to 0.42 mmol/L) and 0.48 mmol/L (95% CI 0.15 mmol/L to 0.80 mmol/L), respectively.Conclusion: Children treated with risperidone or quetiapine are at a significant risk for developing obesity, elevated waist circumference, and dyslipidemia during 12 months of treatment. These data emphasize the importance of regular monitoring for early identification and treatment of metabolic side effects.</ab>
        <ab>connexes chez des enfants après un traitement à long terme par rispéridone ou quétiapine. Méthodes : Il s'agissait d'une étude longitudinale naturaliste d'un an menée entre février 2009 et mars 2012. Un total de 130 enfants de 2 à 18 ans sans exposition précédente aux antipsychotiques de deuxième génération (ADG) ont été inscrits à commencer un traitement par rispéridone ou par quétiapine. Les paramètres métaboliques ont été mesurés au départ et aux 6e et 12e mois. Les données des 37 participants (20 traités par rispéridone et 17 par quétiapine) qui ont complété la surveillance de 12 mois ont servi à l'analyse. Résultats: Après 1 an de traitement par ADG, le poids moyen avait augmenté significativement de 10,8 kg (IC à 95 % 6,6 kg à 10,5 kg) pour la rispéridone et de 9,7 kg (IC à 95 % 6,5 kg à 12,8 kg) pour la quétiapine. Le score z de l'indice de masse corporelle s'est aussi accru significativement chez les 2 groupes (P &lt; 0,001). Il y avait une incidence élevée d'enfants qui devenaient en surpoids ou obèses (6/15 [40,0 %] pour ceux traités par rispéridone et 7/14 [50,0 %] pour ceux traités par quétiapine). Les niveaux moyens de glucose à jeun (pour le traitement par rispéridone) et le ratio de cholestérol total sur le cholestérol à lipoprotéines de haute densité (pour le traitement par quétiapine) augmentaient significativement de 0,23 mmol/L (IC à 95 % 0,03 mmol/L à 0,42 mmol/L) et de 0,48 mmol/L (IC à 95 % 0,15 mmol/L à 0,80 mmol/L), respectivement. Conclusion : Les enfants traités par rispéridone ou par quétiapine sont à risque significatif de développer l'obésité, un tour de taille élevé, et la dyslipidémie durant les 12 mois du traitement. Ces données soulignent l'importance d'une surveillance régulière pour l'identification précoce et le traitement des effets secondaires métaboliques.</ab>

        <ab>The number needed to treat (NNT) statistic was developed to facilitate the practice of evidence-based medicine. Placebo was assumed to be therapeutically inert when the NNT was originally conceived, but more recent data for conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that the placebo control condition can have considerable therapeutic effects. Complications arise because the NNT calculated from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reflects a comparison between medication plus clinical management and placebo plus clinical management, whereas, in the clinical setting, physicians choose between prescribing open medication, observing a patient over time with a supportive approach, and doing nothing. Thus, NNTs derived from clinical trials are not directly relevant to clinical decision-making, because they are based on control conditions that do not exist in standard practice. Additional difficulties may arise when using NNTs to compare alternative treatments for MDD, such as medication and psychotherapy, since these comparisons require the control conditions upon which the respective NNTs are based to be similar.Whereas pill placebo conditions include intensive clinical management and elicit expectations of improvement, attention control conditions for psychotherapy research are less well developed. Often the effects of psychotherapy are gauged against a wait-list control condition, which has substantially fewer therapeutic components than a pill placebo control condition. To improve the clinical utility of NNTs for the treatment of MDD, we advocate effectiveness studies that include treatment conditions resembling actual clinical practice, rather than using placebo-controlled RCTs for this purpose. Until such studies are performed, the effect of bias in comparing NNTs across treatments can be controlled by ensuring that the RCT control conditions upon which the NNTs are based are comparable.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Health care providers have few alternatives for youth depression other than antidepressants. We examined whether brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a viable alternative in primary care. METHODS: A total of 212 adolescents aged 12 to 18 with major depression who had recently declined or quickly discontinued new antidepressant treatment were randomized to self-selected treatment as usual (TAU) control condition or TAU plus brief individual CBT. Blinded evaluators followed youth for 2 years. The primary outcome was time to major depression diagnostic recovery. RESULTS: CBT was superior to the control condition on the primary outcome of time to diagnostic recovery from major depression, with number needed to treat from 4 to 10 across follow-up. A similar CBT advantage was found for time to depression diagnosis response, with number needed to treat of 5 to 50 across time points. We observed a significant advantage for CBT on many secondary outcomes over the first year of follow-up but not the second year. Cohen's d effect sizes for significant continuous measures ranged from 0.28 to 0.44, in the small to medium effect range. Most TAU health care services did not differ across conditions, except for psychiatric hospitalizations, which occurred at a significantly higher rate in the control condition through the first year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Observed results were consistent with recent meta-analyses of CBT for youth depression. The initial year of CBT superiority imparted an important clinical benefit and may reduce the risk of future recurrent depression episodes.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Many offenders treated for psychiatric disorders while incarcerated are paroled to counties where psychiatric care is limited, leading some correctional departments to offer psychiatric treatment via videoconferencing ("telepsychiatry"). However, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry for offenders with psychiatric disorders has not been rigorously evaluated.Methods: In this randomized field experiment, the authors compared the effectiveness of telepsychiatry and in-person psychiatric sessions (treatment as usual) among 71 parolees receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment over a six-month period. Satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic alliance, medication adherence, and psychological functioning were measured. Follow-up data were collected from 60 of the 71 (85%) patients (N=20, telepsychiatry; N=40, control condition).Results: Findings revealed high satisfaction with telepsychiatry overall and no significant group differences in medication adherence or psychological functioning. However, telepsychiatry patients reported lower levels of therapeutic alliance at follow-up.Conclusions: Telepsychiatry appeared to be an acceptable and effective approach for providing psychiatric care for this population.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Little is known about utilization rates of the various depression treatment options available in the private sector for children and adolescents. For privately insured youths, this study examined the utilization frequency of six treatment options for depression with varying degrees of empirical support.Methods: A nationally representative administrative claims database of privately insured individuals (Truven Analytics database, 2008-2010) was used to construct a cohort of 61,599 youths (ages six to 17 years) with depression. Multivariable logistic regression controlling for insurance type, region, and illness severity and complexity assessed, by physician specialty, the likelihood of receiving six different depression treatments (medication combined with psychotherapy, first-line medication, second-line medication, non-evidence-based medication, second-generation antipsychotics, and psychotherapy alone).Results: Only 58.4% of depressed youths received at least one type of depression treatment; 33.6% received psychotherapy alone, 24.8% received medication alone, and 2.7% received combination treatment. Of depressed youths receiving only medication, 24.8% received medications unsupported by empirical evidence (non-evidence-based or second-generation antipsychotics) and 50.6% received medications with equivocal support. Mental health specialists were approximately nine times (odds ratio=8.61) more likely than primary care providers to prescribe combination treatment. Other predictors of receiving combination treatment included having diagnosed major depressive disorder, being a young adolescent (ages 12-14), and residing in the Northeast.Conclusions: Large proportions of depressed youths are not receiving any treatment or are receiving treatments unsupported or equivocally supported by empirical evidence. Additional research is warranted to assess factors associated with nonrecommended use of pharmacotherapies for youths with depression.</ab>

        <ab>STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare treatment effects when patients with insomnia and depression receive treatment for either insomnia or depression. DESIGN: A 9-w randomized controlled trial with 6- and 12-mo follow-up. SETTING: Internet Psychiatry Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three adults in whom comorbid insomnia and depression were diagnosed, recruited via media and assessed by psychiatrists. INTERVENTIONS: Guided Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for either insomnia or depression. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Primary outcome measures were symptom self-rating scales (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] and the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS-S]), assessed before and after treatment with follow-up after 6 and 12 mo. The participants' use of sleep medication and need for further treatment after completion of ICBT was also investigated. The insomnia treatment was more effective than the depression treatment in reducing insomnia severity during treatment (P = 0.05), and equally effective in reducing depression severity. Group differences in insomnia severity were maintained during the 12-mo follow-up period. Post treatment, participants receiving treatment for insomnia had significantly less self-rated need for further insomnia treatment (P &lt; 0.001) and used less sleep medication (P &lt; 0.05) than participants receiving treatment for depression. The need for depression treatment was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Internet-delivered treatment with cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for insomnia was more effective than ICBT for depression for patients with both diagnoses. This indicates, in line with previous research, that insomnia when comorbid with depression is not merely a symptom of depression, but needs specific treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, registration ID: NCT01256099.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To identify the clinical reasons and legal authority for including a residential placement condition in a community treatment order (CTO). Method: We describe the clinical reasons for imposing a residence condition and discuss how this is authorized by the laws of the Canadian provinces (using Ontario as the main example). Results: A residence condition can facilitate numerous benefits, including: regular access to a person by a clinical team; continuing therapeutic relations; supervision of medication; provision of general medical care; and reduction in substance use, risks of victimization, and other unintended harm. A resident condition can be lawfully imposed when it clearly fits the purposes of the CTO legislation and stops short of authorizing detention in a community facility. Conclusions: In certain circumstances, a residence condition is clinically justified and a lawful aspect of a CTO.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Although the average depressed patient benefits moderately from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or pharmacotherapy, some experience divergent outcomes. The authors tested frequencies, predictors, and moderators of negative and unusually positive outcomes.Method: Sixteen randomized clinical trials comparing CBT and pharmacotherapy for unipolar depression in 1,700 patients provided individual pre- and posttreatment scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and/or Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The authors examined demographic and clinical predictors and treatment moderators of any deterioration (increase ≥1 HAM-D or BDI point), reliable deterioration (increase ≥8 HAM-D or ≥9 BDI points), extreme nonresponse (posttreatment HAM-D score ≥21 or BDI score ≥31), superior improvement (HAM-D or BDI decrease ≥95%), and superior response (posttreatment HAM-D or BDI score of 0) using multilevel models.Results: About 5%-7% of patients showed any deterioration, 1% reliable deterioration, 4%-5% extreme nonresponse, 6%-10% superior improvement, and 4%-5% superior response. Superior improvement on the HAM-D only (odds ratio=1.67) and attrition (odds ratio=1.67) were more frequent in pharmacotherapy than in CBT. Patients with deterioration or superior response had lower pretreatment symptom levels, whereas patients with extreme nonresponse or superior improvement had higher levels.Conclusions: Deterioration and extreme nonresponse and, similarly, superior improvement and superior response, both occur infrequently in randomized clinical trials comparing CBT and pharmacotherapy for depression. Pretreatment symptom levels help forecast negative and unusually positive outcomes but do not guide selection of CBT versus pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy may produce clinician-rated superior improvement and attrition more frequently than does CBT.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This study aimed to investigate the impact of depression and anxiety scores on disease activity at 1-year follow-up in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).Methods: The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure depression and anxiety in a cross-section of RA patients. The primary outcome of interest was disease activity (DAS28), measured one-year after baseline assessment. Secondary outcomes were: tender joint count, swollen joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and patient global assessment, also measured one-year after baseline assessment. We also examined the impact of baseline depression and anxiety on odds of reaching clinical remission at 1-year follow-up.Results: In total, 56 RA patients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Before adjusting for key demographic and disease variables, increased baseline depression and anxiety were associated with increased disease activity at one-year follow-up, although this was not sustained after adjusting for baseline disease activity. There was a strong association between depression and anxiety and the subjective components of the DAS28 at 12-month follow-up: tender joint count and patient global assessment. After adjusting for age, gender, disease duration and baseline tender joint count and patient global assessment respectively, higher levels of depression and anxiety at baseline were associated with increased tender joint count and patient global assessment scores at 1-year follow-up.Conclusions: Symptoms of depression and anxiety have implications for disease activity, as measured via the DAS28, primarily due to their influence on tender joints and patient global assessment. These findings have implications for treatment decision-making as inflated DAS28 despite well controlled inflammatory disease markers may indicate significant psychological morbidity and related non-inflammatory pain, rather than true disease activity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Perioperative psychological distress is associated with preoperative anxiety, depression, and postoperative pain. Mirtazapine is effective as an antidepressant, anxiolytic agent, and sleep enhancer. Moreover, mirtazapine can be made as orodispersible tablets with a fast onset for patients in nil per os status. This study is to determine whether mirtazapine can help psychologically distressed patients reduce perioperative anxiety, depression, and postoperative pain.Materials and Methods: Patients with preoperative psychological distress, undergoing major abdominal surgery, were inquired and assigned to two groups according to their own choice. In the treatment group, patients could choose to take orodispersible mirtazapine 30 mg at each night from Preoperative Day 0 to Postoperative Day 3. There was no other intervention in the nontreatment group. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and pain scores were accessed on the day before operation (Day 0), and on the 1(st) day (Day 2) and 3(rd) day (Day 4) after operation. We compared the HADS, AIS, and pain scores, and morphine consumptions between the two groups on a daily basis. Marginal regression models were fitted to our correlated longitudinal data alone with the generalized estimating equations method to estimate the population average effects of time-varying mirtazapine usage on the mean values of HADS, AIS, and pain scores, and daily morphine consumptions.Results: From September 2007 to December 2008, 86 patients agreed to be enrolled and 79 of them completed the study. Propensity scores and multivariate analysis showed that mirtazapine reduced HADS scores of patients in 2 days. Trial results indicated that mirtazapine lowered the AIS day index and tended to decrease night index as well. Mirtazapine may reduce patients' morphine consumption, but this effect was not statistically significant (p = 0.2).Conclusion: Mirtazapine helps reduce anxiety, depression, and insomnia scores for patients with perioperative psychological distress.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses how health literacy (HL) has evolved from a risk factor for poor health outcomes to an asset that can be enhanced through educational strategies. It cites components of HL which include competencies to help obtain and maintain health, understanding how and where to access and evaluate health information and how to properly apply prescribed treatments. It notes that mental health literacy (MHL) is an evolving construct informed by a more comprehensive approach to HL.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mental illness is a major public health concern. Despite progress understanding which treatments work, a significant treatment gap remains. An ongoing concern is treatment length. Modular, flexible, transdiagnostic approaches have been offered as one solution to scalability challenges. The Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is one such approach and offers the ability to treat a wide range of common mental health problems. CETA is supported by two randomized trials from low- and middle-income countries showing strong effectiveness and implementation outcomes.Methods/design: This trial evaluates the effectiveness and implementation of two versions of CETA using a non-inferiority design to test two primary hypotheses: (1) a brief five-session version of CETA (Brief CETA) will provide similar effectiveness for reducing the severity of common mental health problems such as depression, post-traumatic stress, impaired functioning, anxiety, and substance use problems compared with the standard 8-12-session version of CETA (Standard CETA); and (2) both Brief and Standard CETA will have superior impact on the outcomes compared to a wait-list control condition. For both hypotheses, the main effect will be assessed using longitudinal data and mixed-effects regression models over a 6-month period post baseline. A secondary aim includes exploration of implementation factors. Additional planned analyses will include exploration of: moderators of treatment impact by disorder severity and comorbidity; the impact of individual therapeutic components; and trends in symptom change between end of treatment and 6-month assessment for all participants.Discussion: This trial is the first rigorous study comparing a standard-length (8-12 sessions) modular, flexible, transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral approach to a shortened version of the approach (five sessions). Brief CETA entails "front-loading" with elements that research suggests are strong mechanisms of change. The study design will allow us to draw conclusions about the effects of both Brief and Standard CETA as well as which elements are integral to their mechanisms of action, informing future implementation and fidelity efforts. The results from this trial will inform future dissemination, implementation and scale-up of CETA in Ukraine and contribute to our understanding of the effects of modular, flexible, transdiagnostic approaches in similar contexts.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03058302 (U.S. National Library of Medicine).

        <ab>Objective: Health-care workers in developed nations are well known to experience high levels of burnout and psychiatric morbidity, but little information is available from the Caribbean and other less well-developed regions. This study sought to explore the prevalence of stress, burnout, and depressive symptoms and associated risk factors among medical students in Trinidad and Tobago, the southernmost Caribbean island.Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used to sample students. Data was collected utilizing standardized questionnaires that assess stress, burnout, and depressive symptoms. Demographic data and information pertaining to potential risk factors was also gathered. Overall, 450 questionnaires were distributed and analysis was performed upon 381 completed surveys (response rate 85%).Results: Students demonstrated high levels of stress and a significant prevalence of burnout (52%) and depressive symptoms (40%). Final year students demonstrated higher levels of burnout and depressive symptoms. Students who (i) felt they lacked emotional support, (ii) had little opportunity for relaxation and exercise, and (iii) did not feel they had control of their daily schedule all demonstrated higher levels of burnout and depressive symptoms. However, students who practiced from a faith base and considered their religion important demonstrated lower levels of both.Conclusions: Medical students in Trinidad and Tobago are experiencing high levels of stress with a large proportion suffering from burnout and depressive symptoms. These data suggest that immediate interventions are necessary to help students cope with the challenges faced during medical school. Additionally, more research is needed to explore the potential causal links between burnout and depression during medical school and the effectiveness of tailored interventions especially within the context of developing nations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The mental health-care system in Sweden, as in many other counties, has its main focus on the reduction of psychiatric symptoms and the prevention of relapses. People diagnosed with schizophrenia often have significant health issues and experience reduced well-being in everyday life. The social imaginary of mental illness as an imbalance of the brain has implications concerning general attitudes in society. The news media are an important source of information on psychiatric disorders and have an important role in cultivating public perceptions and stigma. News media can contribute to the mental illness stigma and place individuals with mental illnesses at risk of not receiving adequate care and support. The aim of this preliminary study was to describe users' experiences of housing support in everyday life. Results: The results revealed three themes of housing support, which were needed, but frequently insufficiently fulfilled in the municipality. The three themes were: "Support to Practice Healthy Routines in Daily Life," "Support to Shape Meaningful Contents in Everyday Life," and "Support to Meet Needs of Integrity and Respect." Conclusions: The findings support previous studies arguing that current health care and housing support fails to meet basic needs and may lead to significant and unnecessary health risks. Further investigation is needed regarding the links between attitudes to mental illness in society and political and financial principles for health care and housing support for persons with schizophrenia. Further research is needed regarding the role of the media in policymaking concerning health promotion interventions for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Earlier smaller studies have shown associations between child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and schizophrenia. Particularly, attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder and autism have been linked with schizophrenia. However, large-scale prospective studies have been lacking. We, therefore, conducted the first large-scale study on the association between a broad spectrum of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and the risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Methods: Danish nationwide registers were linked to establish a cohort consisting of all persons born during 1990-2000 and the cohort was followed until December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed using survival analyses and adjusted for calendar year, age, and sex. Results: A total of 25 138 individuals with child and adolescent psychiatric disorders were identified, out of which 1232 individuals were subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorders was highly elevated, particularly within the first year after onset of the child and adolescent psychiatric disorder, and remained significantly elevated &gt;5 years with an incidence rate ratio of 4.93 (95% confidence interval: 4.37-5.54). We utilized the cumulated incidences and found that among persons diagnosed with a child and adolescent psychiatric disorder between the ages 0-13 years and 14-17 years, 1.68% and 8.74 %, respectively, will be diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder &lt;8 years after onset of the child and adolescent psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: The risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders after a child and adolescent psychiatric disorder was significantly increased particularly in the short term but also in the long-term period.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders affect 20-30% of school-age youth, most of whom do not receive adequate services, contributing to poor developmental and academic outcomes. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can improve outcomes, but numerous barriers limit access among affected youth. Many youth try to access mental health services in schools, but school professionals (SPs: counselors, psychologists, social workers) are rarely trained adequately in CBT methods. Further, SPs face organizational barriers to providing CBT, such as lack of administrative support. Three promising implementation strategies to address barriers to school-based CBT delivery include (1) Replicating Effective Programs (REP), which deploys customized CBT packaging, didactic training in CBT, and technical assistance; (2) coaching, which extends training via live supervision to improve SP competence in CBT delivery; and (3) facilitation, which employs an organizational expert who mentors SPs in strategic thinking to promote self-efficacy in garnering administrative support. REP is a relatively low-intensity/low-cost strategy, whereas coaching and facilitation require additional resources. However, not all schools will require all three strategies. The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a school-level adaptive implementation intervention involving REP, coaching, and facilitation versus REP alone on the frequency of CBT delivered to students by SPs and student mental health outcomes. Secondary and exploratory aims examine cost-effectiveness, moderators, and mechanisms of implementation strategies.Methods: Using a clustered, sequential multiple-assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, ≥ 200 SPs from 100 schools across Michigan will be randomized initially to receive REP vs. REP+coaching. After 8 weeks, schools that do not meet a pre-specified implementation benchmark are re-randomized to continue with the initial strategy or to augment with facilitation.Discussion: EBPs need to be implemented successfully and efficiently in settings where individuals are most likely to seek care in order to gain large-scale impact on public health. Adaptive implementation interventions hold the promise of providing cost-effective implementation support. This is the first study to test an adaptive implementation of CBT for school-age youth, at a statewide level, delivered by school staff, taking an EBP to large populations with limited mental health care access.Trial Registration: NCT03541317 -Registered on 29 May 2018 on ClinicalTrials.gov PRS.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Anxiety and depression are frequent comorbidities in people with epilepsy (PWE), but possible gender differences are often neglected. The aim of the present study was to analyze if men and women with epilepsy differ with regard to anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify possible predictors.Methods: Adult consecutive PWE (N=302; 53% women) completed self-report questionnaires, including the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the anxiety module of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) and the subscales "medication effects" and "seizure worry" of the Patient-weighted Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31-P (QOLIE-31-P).Results: There was no gender difference in extent of anxiety (p=.532), which was mainly due to higher anxiety levels in men compared to the general population. The gender difference in depressive symptoms was significant (p=.009), with female patients being more affected. The most important predictors for anxiety and depressive symptoms were detrimental effects of medication (QOL medication effects) and of seizure worry (QOL seizure worry). Moreover, these predictors were more closely associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms in men.Conclusion: Future intervention studies could show whether providing more information about the illness and medication effects may improve anxiety and depression. Our results suggest that such interventions should be tailored to the different needs of men and women.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Males employed in the construction industry have high rates of suicide. Although reasons underpinning this risk are multifaceted, poor help-seeking and stigma are represent major contributors. Males in the construction industry are also exposed to other risk factors for mental ill health and suicide, including unemployment. Sigma-reducing interventions that are accessible and attractive to recently unemployed males in the construction industry could therefore improve help-seeking, and address depression and suicidal behaviour in this population.Methods/design: Contact&amp;Connect will use a parallel individual randomized design to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimedia-based intervention aimed at reducing stigma. The intervention consists of a package of 12 brief contact interventions (BCIs) delivered over a six month period. BCIs will direct participants to informational programs and microsites. Content will address three major themes: debunking depression myths and stereotypes, normalisation, and empowerment. Target enrollment is 630 (315 in each arm), each to be followed for 12 months. Eligible participants will be males, between 30 and 64 years, unemployed at the time of recruitment, registered with Incolink (a social welfare trustee company for unemployed members of the construction industry), and own a smart phone with enabled internet connectivity.Discussion: At present, there are no programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing stigma in the blue-collar male population. Contact&amp;Connect promises to provide a tailored, efficient, and scalable approach to reducing stigma, depressive symptoms and suicidality among unemployed males.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ACTRN12615000792527 (date of registration: 30 July, 2015).</ab>

        <ab>In the mid-1960s, federal legislation provided psychiatry with funds for construction and initial staffing of local community mental health programs and funded university psychiatry departments to support research, innovations, and education in social-community psychiatry. Psychiatry gained resources for treating diseases and for addressing the disabilities that accompany mental illnesses. Abrupt losses of federal funding in the following decades, combined with restrictive insurance reimbursements and the expanding influence of the pharmaceutical industry, undermined psychiatry's abilities to address the needs of persons with severe mental illness. The author describes the perverse shift in social priorities that has occurred-with persons who have chronic mental illness housed in jails and heightened public perceptions that mass murders are the acts of persons with mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Repeated hospitalizations and arrests or incarcerations diminish the ability of individuals with serious mental illnesses to pursue recovery. Community mental health systems need new models to address recidivism as well as service fragmentation, lack of engagement by local stakeholders, and poor communication between mental health providers and the police. This study examined the initial effects on institutional recidivism and measures of recovery among persons enrolled in Opening Doors to Recovery, an intensive, team-based community support program for persons with mental illness and a history of inpatient psychiatric recidivism. A randomized controlled trial of the model is underway.Methods: The number of hospitalizations, days hospitalized, and arrests (all from state administrative sources) in the year before enrollment and during the first 12 months of enrollment in the program were compared. Longitudinal trajectories of recovery-using three self-report and five clinician-rated measures-were examined. Analyses accounted for baseline symptom severity and intensity of involvement in the program.Results: One hundred participants were enrolled, and 72 were included in the analyses. Hospitalizations decreased, from 1.9±1.6 to .6±.9 (p&lt;.001), as did hospital days, from 27.6±36.4 to 14.9±41.3 (p&lt;.001), although number of arrests (which are rare events) did not. Significant linear trends were observed for recovery measures, and trajectories of improvement were apparent across the entire follow-up period.Conclusions: Opening Doors to Recovery holds promise as a new service approach for reducing hospital recidivism and promoting recovery in community mental health systems and is deserving of further controlled testing.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) might be associated with the symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleep disturbances and sexual dysfunctions. This study was designed to determine the effects of crocin on psychological parameters in patients under MMT.Methods: Patients under MMT were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either 30 mg/day crocin (2 plus crocin tablet, 15 mg BID) (n = 25) or placebo (2 tablets per day, 15 mg BID) (n = 25), one hour after taking food, for 8 weeks. Psychological parameters were evaluated at baseline and end of the trial to determine related associations between crocin and patients' mental health status.Results: After 8-week intervention, crocin significantly decreased Beck Depression Inventory (b - 6.66; 95% CI, - 9.88, - 3.45; P &lt; 0.0001), Beck Anxiety Inventory (b - 4.35; 95% CI, - 5.94, - 2.75; P &lt; 0.0001), general health questionnaire (b - 4.45; 95% CI, - 7.68, - 1.22; P = 0.008) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (b - 2.73; 95% CI, - 3.74, - 1.73; P &lt; 0.0001) in patients under MMT, compared with the placebo. Crocin also significantly improved International Index of Erectile Functions (b 4.98; 95% CI, 2.08, 7.88; P = 0.001) rather than placebo.Conclusion: Our findings indicated that taking crocin for 8 weeks by patients under MMT had beneficial effects on their mental health status. Crocin can be recommended as an adjunct to methadone in opioid withdrawal protocols because of the ability to improve the quality of life and decrease opioids side effects in these patients.

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for psychiatric disorders among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) survivors in their early to mid-30s and to determine whether those born small for gestational age or those exposed to a full course of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) were at particularly high risk. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, population-based cohort of 84 ELBW survivors and 90 normal birth weight (NBW) control participants born in Ontario, Canada from 1977 to 1982 were assessed by interviewers naive to birth weight status using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. RESULTS: ELBW survivors had lower odds of an alcohol or substance use disorder but higher odds of current non-substance-related psychiatric problems (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-5.14). Those born ELBW and SGA exhibited the same patterns with larger effects. ACS-exposed ELBW survivors had even higher odds of any current non-substance-related psychiatric disorder (OR = 4.41; 95% CI, 1.65-11.82), particularly generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.06-11.06), the generalized type of social phobia (OR = 5.80; 95% CI, 1.20-27.99), and the inattentive subtype of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR = 11.45; 95% CI, 2.06-63.50). CONCLUSIONS: In their early to mid-30s, ELBW survivors were less likely to have alcohol or substance use disorders but may be at greater risk for other psychiatric problems. Those exposed to ACS were at especially high risk and manifested no reduction in alcohol or substance use disorders. ELBW survivors exposed to ACS may be a special group at risk for psychopathology in adulthood.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate whether the significant and substantive findings from a previous study of youth mental health literacy (MHL) could be replicated using the same methods in another population. Method: We examined the impact of a curriculum resource, the Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide (The Guide), taught by usual classroom teachers on students' knowledge and attitudes related to mental health and mental illness in Canadian secondary schools. Survey data were collected before, immediately after, and 2 months after implementation of The Guide by teachers in usual classroom teaching. We conducted paired-sample t tests and calculated the Cohen d value to determine outcomes and impact of the curriculum resource application. Results: One hundred fourteen students were matched for analysis of knowledge data and 112 students were matched for analysis of attitude data at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up time periods. Following classroom exposure to the curriculum resource, students' knowledge scores increased significantly and substantively, compared with baseline (P &lt; 0.001, d = 1.11), and this was maintained at 2-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.91). Similar findings for attitude improvement were found (P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.66), and this improvement was maintained at 2-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.52). Conclusions: These findings corroborate those from a previous study conducted in a different location. Taken together these results suggest a simple but effective approach to improving MHL in young people by embedding a classroom resource, delivered by usual classroom teachers in usual school settings.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Déterminer si les résultats significatifs et substantiels d'une étude précédente sur les connaissances en santé mentale (CSM) des jeunes pourraient être répliqués à l'aide des mêmes méthodes dans une autre population. Méthode : Nous avons examiné l'impact d'une ressource de programme d'études, le Guide de programme d'études pour la santé mentale en école secondaire (le Guide), enseigné en classe par des enseignants réguliers et portant sur les connaissances des élèves et les attitudes liées à la santé mentale et à la maladie mentale dans les écoles secondaires canadiennes. Les données du sondage ont été recueillies avant, immédiatement après, et 2 mois après la mise en oeuvre du Guide par les enseignants pour l'enseignement régulier en classe. Nous avons mené des tests t d'échantillons appariés et calculé la valeur d de Cohen pour déterminer les résultats et l'impact de l'application de la ressource du programme d'études. Résultats : Cent quatorze élèves ont été appariés à une analyse des données des connaissances et 112 élèves ont été appariés à une analyse des données sur les attitudes avant l'intervention, après l'intervention, et à des périodes de suivi de 2 mois. Suivant l'exposition en classe au programme d'études, les scores de connaissances des élèves ont augmenté significativement et substantiellement, comparativement au départ (P &lt; 0,001; d = 1,11), et cela s'est maintenu au suivi à 2 mois (P &lt; 0,001; d = 0,91). Des résultats semblables ont été constatés pour l'amélioration des attitudes (P &lt; 0,001; d = 0,66), et cette amélioration s'est maintenue au suivi à 2 mois (P &lt; 0,001; d = 0,52). Conclusions : Ces résultats corroborent ceux d'une étude précédente menée à un endroit différent. Ensemble, ces résultats suggèrent une approche simple mais efficace pour améliorer la LSM chez les jeunes, en intégrant une ressource en classe, donnée par des enseignants réguliers dans des milieux scolaires réguliers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Most research on interventions to counter stigma and discrimination has focused on short-term outcomes and has been conducted in high-income settings.Aims: To synthesise what is known globally about effective interventions to reduce mental illness-based stigma and discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Method: We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact.Results: Eighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and -0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies.Conclusions: There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes. Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in the medium to long term. Methodologically strong research is needed on which to base decisions on investment in stigma-reducing interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: CHRNA7, coding α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), is involved in cognition through interneuron modulation of dopamine and glutamate signaling. CHRNA7 and its partially duplicated chimeric gene CHRFAM7A have been implicated in schizophrenia through linkage and association studies.Method: Expression of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A mRNA was measured in the postmortem prefrontal cortex in more than 700 subjects, including patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and normal comparison subjects. The effects of antipsychotics and nicotine, as well as associations of CHRNA7 SNPs with gene expression, were explored. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization was used to examine coexpression of both transcripts in the human cortex.Results: CHRFAM7A expression and CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 ratios were higher in fetal compared with postnatal life, whereas CHRNA7 expression was relatively stable. CHRFAM7A expression was significantly elevated in all diagnostic groups, while CHRNA7 expression was reduced in the schizophrenia group and increased in the major depression group compared with the comparison group. CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 ratios were significantly increased in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups compared with the comparison group. There was no effect of nicotine or antipsychotics and no association of SNPs in CHRNA7 with expression. CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A mRNAs were expressed in the same neuronal nuclei of the human neocortex.Conclusions: These data show preferential fetal CHRFAM7A expression in the human prefrontal cortex and suggest abnormalities in the CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 ratios in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, due mainly to overexpression of CHRFAM7A. Given that these transcripts are coexpressed in a subset of human cortical neurons and can interact to alter function of nAChRs, these results support the concept of aberrant function of nAChRs in mental illness.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo: El CHRNA7, receptor nicotínico neuronal para la acetilcolina del subtipo α7 (α7 nAChR), está implicado en la cognición a través de la modulación interneuronal de la señalización de dopamina y glutamato. El CHRNA7 y su gen quimérico parcialmente duplicado CHRFAM7A han estado implicados en la esquizofrenia a través de estudios de ligamiento y asociación. Método: Se midió la expresión del ARNm de los genes CHRNA7 y CHRFAM7A en la corteza prefrontal postmortem en más de 700 sujetos, incluyendo pacientes con esquizofrenia, trastorno bipolar y depresión mayor, y en sujetos normales de comparación. Se exploraron los efectos de los antipsicóticos y la nicotina, así como las asociaciones de los SNPs en CHRNA7con la expresión genética. Se utilizó hibridación fluorescente in-situ para examinar la co-expresión de ambas transcripciones en la corteza humana. Resultados: La expresión de CHRFAM7A y los cocientes de CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 fueron más altos en la etapa fetal que en la vida postnatal, mientras que la expresión de CHRNA7 fue relativamente estable. La expresión de CHRFAM7A fue significativamente elevada en todos los grupos de diagnóstico, mientras que la expresión de CHRNA7 fue reducida en el grupo de esquizofrenia y aumentada en el grupo de depresión mayor, comparado con el grupo de comparación. Los cocientes CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 fueron significativamente elevados en los grupos de esquizofrenia y de trastorno bipolar comparado con el grupo de comparación. No hubo ningún efecto de la nicotina ni los antipsicóticos, ni ninguna asociacion de los SNPs en el gen CHRNA7 con la expresión. Los ARNm del CHRNA7 y el CHRFAM7A fueron expresados en los mismos núcleos neuronales de la neocorteza humana. Conclusiones: Estos datos demuestran una expresión fetal preferencial del CHRFAM7A en la corteza prefrontal humana y sugieren anomalías en los cocientes CHRFAM7A/CHRNA7 en esquizofrenia y trastorno bipolar, principalmente debido a la sobre-expresión del CHRFAM7A. Dado que dichas transcripciones están co-expresadas en un subconjunto de neuronas corticales humanas y pueden interactuar para alterar la función de los nAChRs, estos resultados apoyan el concepto de la función aberrante de los nAChRs en la enfermedad mental.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prolonged stress may lead to mental illness, but the prevalence of stress in a working age population seeking primary health care for whatever reason, is unknown. This paper seeks to examine to what extent this group perceives stress, as well as symptoms of burnout/exhaustion, depression and anxiety. Methods: In 2009, 587 primary health care patients aged 18-65 years (377 women, 210 men), with an appointment with a primary health care physician, participated in the study. A screening questionnaire with questions about age, gender, marital status, employment, reason for medical consultation, and the QPS Nordic screening question about stress was distributed:” Stress is defined as a condition where you feel tense, restless, anxious or worried or cannot sleep at night because you think of problems all the time. Do you feel that kind of stress these days? There were five possible answers; “not at all” and ”only a little” (level 1),“to some extent” (level 2),“rather much” and “very much” (level 3). In a second step, symptoms of burnout/exhaustion (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire and the Self-rated Exhaustion Disorder instrument) and anxiety/depression (Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale) were assessed among those with higher levels of perceived stress. Results: 345 (59%) of the study patients indicated stress levels 2 or 3 (237 women and 108 men). Women more often indicated increased levels of stress than men. Two thirds of the participants expressing stress levels 2-3 indicated a high degree of burnout, and approximately half of them indicated Exhaustion Disorder (ED). Among highly stressed patients (level 3), 33% reported symptoms indicating possible depression and 64% possible anxiety. Conclusion: More than half of this working age population perceived more than a little stress, as defined, women to a greater extent than men. Symptoms of burnout and exhaustion were common. A high level of perceived stress was often accompanied by symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Suicide is a major cause of preventable death, and suicidal behaviour is prevalent in acute psychiatric wards. People admitted to acute psychiatric wards often experience repeated episodes of suicidal behaviour, causing great distress and heavy use of NHS services. There is little research investigating effective psychological treatments for suicidal patients in inpatient settings although previous research has found support for psychological therapies which specifically target suicidal behaviour. This paper describes the protocol of a single blind RCT to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of a cognitive behavioural intervention targeting suicidality (CBSP) for suicidal people in acute psychiatric wards.Methods/design: A single blind RCT comparing treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU plus Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention (CBSP) therapy (TAU + CBSP). Sixty participants (aged 18-65 years) who are suicidal, or have been within the past 3 months, will be recruited from NHS trusts in the North West of England. Our primary objective is to determine whether CBSP is feasible, acceptable and efficacious when compared to patients who receive TAU alone. Secondary aims are the impact of CBSP on suicidal thinking, behaviours, functioning, quality of life, service use and psychological factors associated with suicide. Assessments take place at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months (end of treatment). The analysis will report on the feasibility and acceptability of CBSP. Qualitative data from staff and service users will inform feasibility and acceptability data.Discussion: Psychiatric inpatients are a high-risk group and the use of psychological therapies in these settings is rare and requires evaluation. This study is essential to investigate the unique contextual challenges involved in delivering psychological therapy to suicidal inpatients and to identify any necessary modifications required within inpatient settings. The findings will inform a larger, definitive trial.Trial Registration: 15 March 2012, PB-PG-1111-26026, NIHR ISRCTN17890126 .</ab>

        <ab>Study Question: Does the perception of failure without a solution or way forward of infertile couples have a mediator role between the importance couples attribute to parenthood and depressive symptoms?Summary Answer: The perception of failure without a solution or way forward, assessed by feelings of entrapment and defeat, mediates the effect of the importance of parenthood on depressive symptoms of infertile men and women.What Is Known Already: Research has documented that the heightened importance of parenthood affects infertile couples' adjustment to infertility and medical treatments. However, it remains unclear which psychological mechanisms and perceptions may underlie the association between having parenthood as a nuclear aspect of life and presenting depressive symptoms related to difficulties in accomplishing that important life goal. Although these links have been scantly addressed in infertility, previous studies have pointed to the role that perceptions of defeat and entrapment have in several psychopathological conditions.Study Design, Size, Duration: The study was cross-sectional. Couples pursuing medical treatment for their fertility problems were invited to participate by their doctors in several public and private clinics. Data collection took place between July 2009 and 2011.Participants/materials, Setting, Methods: One hundred forty-seven infertile couples consented to participate in the study. Both couple members (147 women and 147 men) completed a set of self-report instruments for the assessment of depressive symptoms, perceptions of defeat and entrapment, importance of parenthood and rejection of a childfree lifestyle. Analyses were conducted through Structural Equation Modeling and followed a dyadic analysis strategy, allowing for controlling the interdependence of the data.Main Results and the Role Of Chance: The hypothesized tested model showed a very good fit to the data [(χ(2) = 68.45, P = 0.014, comparative fit index = 0.98, standardized root-mean-square residual = 0.06 and root mean square error of approximation = 0.06] and explained 67 and 58% of the variability in depressive symptoms in women and men, respectively. Results revealed that the importance of parenthood does not have a direct effect on depressive symptoms of infertile men and women, but an indirect effect, by affecting the perception of having failed and not being able to solve it or move forward [women: estimate for indirect effect: 0.38 (bias corrected (BC) 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.25; 0.56; P &lt; 0.001); men: estimate for indirect effect: 0.23 (BC 95% CI = 0.06; 0.40; P = 0.013)].Limitations, Reasons For Caution: The study was cross-sectional, which does not allow for the establishment of causality. Another limitation is the heterogeneity of the sample, as participants were recruited at various stages of their fertility care. In addition, due to the specific nature of the variables, further studies are needed to establish exactly how the relationship between defeat and entrapment and depression operates, as the mechanism may be bidirectional.Wider Implications Of the Findings: This study emphasizes the role of perceptions of defeat and entrapment on the psychological adjustment to infertility and assisted reproduction. These emotional processes should be taken into consideration and targeted in psychological interventions of couples undergoing medical treatments for infertility. In fact, although parenthood may be perceived as a core purpose for many couples dealing with difficulties in conceiving, it is only when these difficulties are experienced as failures without a resolution and as inescapable, that couples are prone to develop depressive symptoms.Study Funding/competing Interests: This research has been supported by the first author Ph.D. Grant (SFRH/BD/68392/2010), sponsored by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT). The authors have no conflict of interests.Trial Registration Number: N/A.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Previous psychological and pharmacological interventions have primarily focused on depression disorders in populations with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and the efficacy of anxiety disorder interventions is only more recently being explored. Transdiagnostic interventions address common emotional processes and the full range of anxiety and depression disorders often observed in populations with CVDs. The aim of CHAMPS is to evaluate the feasibility of a unified protocol (UP) for the transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders intervention in patients recently hospitalized for CVDs. The current study reports the protocol of a feasibility randomized controlled trial to inform a future trial.Methods/design: This is a feasibility randomized, controlled trial with a single-center design. A total of 50 participants will be block-randomized to either a UP intervention or enhanced usual care. Both groups will receive standard CVD care. The UP intervention consists of 1) enhancing motivation, readiness for change, and treatment engagement; (2) psychoeducation about emotions; (3) increasing present focused emotion awareness; (4) increasing cognitive flexibility; (5) identifying and preventing patterns of emotion avoidance and maladaptive emotion-driven behaviors (EDBs, including tobacco smoking, and alcohol use); (6) increasing tolerance of emotion-related physical sensations; (7) interoceptive and situation-based emotion-focused exposure; and (8) relapse prevention strategies. Treatment duration is 12 to 18 weeks. Relevant outcomes include the standard deviation of self-rated anxiety, depression and quality of life symptoms. Other outcomes include intervention acceptability, satisfaction with care, rates of EDBs, patient adherence, physical activity, cardiac and psychiatric readmissions. Parallel to the main trial, a nonrandomized comparator cohort will be recruited comprising 150 persons scoring below the predetermined depression and anxiety severity thresholds.Discussion: CHAMPS is designed to evaluate the UP for the transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders targeting emotional disorder processes in a CVD population. The design will provide preliminary evidence of feasibility, attrition, and satisfaction with treatment to design a definitive trial. If the trial is feasible, it opens up the possibility for interventions to target broader emotional processes in the precarious population with CVD and emotional distress.Trial Registration: ACTRN12615000555550 , registered on 29/05/2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mental health service delivery models that are grounded in the local context are needed to address the substantial treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries.Aims: To present the development, and content, of a mental healthcare plan (MHCP) in Nepal and assess initial feasibility.Method: A mixed methods formative study was conducted. Routine monitoring and evaluation data, including client flow and reports of satisfaction, were obtained from patients (n = 135) during the pilot-testing phase in two health facilities.Results: The resulting MHCP consists of 12 packages, divided over community, health facility and organisation platforms. Service implementation data support the real-life applicability of the MHCP, with reasonable treatment uptake. Key barriers were identified and addressed, namely dissatisfaction with privacy, perceived burden among health workers and high drop-out rates.Conclusions: The MHCP follows a collaborative care model encompassing community and primary healthcare interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To conduct a follow-up on the rate and related risk factors of probable disaster-related psychiatric disorders such as depressive disorder (major depressive episode, MDE), stress disorders, post-traumatic (posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD), and the quality of life of the survivors of a fossil gas explosion in Taiwan 18 months after the event.Methods: A community-based survey of residents of a community that experienced a petrochemical gas explosion with cross-sectional assessments was conducted 18 months after the event. Two screening tools, including the Disaster-Related Psychological Screening Test (DRPST) and Short Form 12v2 (SF-12v2), were used to survey a representative sample of 388 participants.Results: The average age of 388 participants is 43.27 ± 15.98 years (males: 203, average age: 41.44 ± 15.74 years; females: 185; average age: 45.27 ± 16.03 years). Probable PTSD, probable MDE, probable PTSD and MDE, and non-PTSD or non-MDE (non-P or -M) were present in 34 (8.8%), 14 (3.6%), 9 (2.3%), and 331 (85.3%) participants, respectively. The significant associated factor for probable PTSD or MDE among those who experienced disaster was financial problems. The associated factors on different quality of life subscales were old age, physical injury, employment, educational level, financial problems, probable PTSD and probable MDE.Conclusion: While participants' psychiatric status improved after 18 months, their quality of life continued to be affected, especially the quality of life of those with probable PTSD combined with MDE. Postdisaster treatment and follow-up should be addressed to a greater degree, especially for victims with mental illness, physical injuries and financial problems.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Primary care physicians (PCPs) working in mental health care in Tunisia often lack knowledge and skills needed to adequately address mental health-related issues. To address these lacunas, a training based on the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) Intervention Guide (IG) was offered to PCPs working in the Greater Tunis area between February and April 2016. While the mhGAP-IG has been used extensively in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to help build non-specialists' mental health capacity, little research has focused on how contextual factors interact with the implemented training program to influence its expected outcomes. This paper's objective is to fill that lack.Methods: We conducted a case study with a purposeful sample of 18 trained PCPs. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews between March and April 2016. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis.Results: Participants identified more barriers than facilitators when describing contextual factors influencing the mhGAP-based training's expected outcomes. Barriers were regrouped into five categories: structural factors (e.g., policies, social context, local workforce development, and physical aspects of the environment), organizational factors (e.g., logistical issues for the provision of care and collaboration within and across healthcare organizations), provider factors (e.g., previous mental health experience and personal characteristics), patient factors (e.g., beliefs about the health system and healthcare professionals, and motivation to seek care), and innovation factors (e.g., training characteristics). These contextual factors interacted with the implemented training to influence knowledge about pharmacological treatments and symptoms of mental illness, confidence in providing treatment, negative beliefs about certain mental health conditions, and the understanding of the role of PCPs in mental health care delivery. In addition, post-training, participants still felt uncomfortable with certain aspects of treatment and the management of some mental health conditions.Conclusions: Findings highlight the complexity of implementing a mhGAP-based training given its interaction with contextual factors to influence the attainment of expected outcomes. Results may be used to tailor structural, organizational, provider, patient, and innovation factors prior to future implementations of the mhGAP-based training in Tunisia. Findings may also be used by decision-makers interested in implementing the mhGAP-IG training in other LMICs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prenatal maternal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure leads to behavioral deficits such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia in the adult lives. LPS-exposure resulted in the production of cytokines and oxidative damage. On the contrary, astaxanthin is a carotenoid compound, showed neuroprotective properties via its antioxidant capacity. This study examines the effect of astaxanthin on the prenatal maternal LPS-induced postnatal behavioral deficit in mice.Results: We found that prenatal LPS-exposed mice showed extensive immobile phase in the tail suspension test, higher frequent head dipping in the hole-board test and greater hypolocomotion in the open field test. All these values were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, a marked elevation of the level of lipid peroxidation, advanced protein oxidation product, nitric oxide, while a pronounced depletion of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) were observed in the adult offspring mice that were prenatally exposed to LPS. To the contrary, 6-weeks long treatment with astaxanthin significantly improved all behavioral deficits (p &lt; 0.05) and diminished prenatal LPS-induced oxidative stress markers in the brain and liver.Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal maternal LPS-exposure leads to behavioral deficits in the adults, while astaxanthin ameliorates the behavioral deficits presumably via its antioxidant property.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cognitive-behavioural therapy is efficacious in the treatment of major depressive disorder but response rates are still far from satisfactory.Aims: To better understand brain responses to individualised emotional stimuli and their association with outcome, to enhance treatment.Method: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected prior to individual psychotherapy. Differences in brain activity during passive viewing of individualised self-critical material in 23 unmedicated out-patients with depression and 28 healthy controls were assessed. The associations between brain activity, cognitive and emotional change, and outcome were analysed in 21 patients.Results: Patients showed enhanced activity in the amygdala and ventral striatum compared with the control group. Non-response to therapy was associated with enhanced activity in the right amygdala compared with those who responded, and activity in this region was negatively associated with outcome. Emotional but not cognitive changes mediated this association.Conclusions: Amygdala hyperactivity may lessen symptom improvement in psychotherapy for depression through attenuating emotional skill acquisition.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Various models of peer support may be implemented in mental health settings. This randomized trial assessed the effectiveness of a telephone-delivered mutual peer support intervention.Methods: A total of 443 patients receiving ongoing depression treatment from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs were enrolled in either enhanced usual care (N=243) or the peer support intervention (N=200). Intent-to-treat analyses assessed outcomes at six months postenrollment, excluding 56 patients who experienced an unplanned telephone platform shutdown.Results: At baseline, patients had substantial depressive symptoms, functional limitations, and low quality of life. Both groups showed significant clinical improvements at six months, with no significant differences by group.Conclusions: Telephone-delivered mutual peer support for patients with depression did not improve outcomes beyond those observed with enhanced usual care. Other peer support models, with more "professionalized" peers delivering a structured curriculum, may be more effective.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is one of the most prevalent mood disorders, and is known to be associated with abnormal functional connectivity in neural networks of the brain. Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with depression experience spontaneous remission without any treatment. However, the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity and the spontaneous remission in depression remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated regional and network brain activity using EEG signals from a chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced mouse model of depression. After 1 (CRS1W) or 3 weeks (CRS3W) following the cessation of a 4-week-long CRS, mice were subjected to depression-associated behavioral tasks. EEG signals were obtained from eight cortical regions (frontal, somatosensory, parietal, and visual cortices in each hemisphere).Results: The CRS1W group exhibited behavioral dysfunctions in the open field and forced swim tasks, whereas the CRS3W group displayed normal levels of behaviors in those tasks. In a linear correlation analysis, the CRS1W group exhibited increased correlation coefficient values at all frequency bands (delta, 1.5-4; theta, 4-8; alpha, 8-12; beta, 12-30; gamma, 30-80 Hz) compared with the control group. However, the differences in delta- and gamma-frequency bands between the control and CRS1W groups were no longer observed in the CRS3W group. Persistent brain network homology revealed significantly different functional connectivity between the control and CRS1W groups, and it demonstrated a huge restoration of the decreased distances in the gamma-frequency band for the CRS3W group. Moreover, the CRS3W group displayed a similar strength of connectivity among somatosensory and frontal cortices as the control group.Conclusion: A mouse model of CRS-induced depression showed spontaneous behavioral remission of depressive behavior. Using persistent brain network homology analysis of EEG signals from eight cortical regions, we found that restoration of gamma activity at the network level is associated with behavioral remission.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI) is a multidimensional questionnaire that investigates five dimensions in low back pain (LBP) patients, but does not address the psychological dimension. As the biopsychosocial perspective is recognized as important to capture the entire clinical picture of these patients, this multicenter prospective cohort study was designed to investigate the psychometric properties of a modified version of the COMI (COMIAD) which included 2 additional items, exploring anxiety and depression, respectively.Methods: 168 subacute or chronic LBP patients recruited in spine clinics completed a set of questionnaires before and after treatment (follow-up at 6 months). Construct validity was explored by comparing each item of the COMIAD to validated full-length questionnaires. Thus two additional questionnaires were included to assess the construct validity of the anxiety and depression measures. The psychometric properties of the COMI and COMIAD were then compared.Results: The two new items showed good internal consistency, high correlations with the corresponding full-length questionnaires, no floor or ceiling effect and good reproducibility (test-retest agreement kappa 0.68 for anxiety, 0.62 for depression). The addition of the 2 items did not alter internal validity (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88 and 0.87, respectively). The smallest detectable difference, the Minimal Clinically Important Improvement and the Patient Acceptable Symptom State were only minimally affected by the changes.Conclusion: The questions exploring anxiety and depression have good intrinsic and psychometric capacities (i.e., no floor or ceiling effects and high correlations with full-length scales) and did not significantly modify the psychometrics of the original COMI questionnaire. The COMIAD offers the possibility to include the psychological dimension in the multidimensional evaluation without significantly affecting questionnaire length.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Women diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) typically experience worse outcomes relative to men, possibly through diagnosis and treatment delays. Reasons for these delays may be influenced by mood and anxiety disorders, which are more prevalent in women and have symptoms (eg, palpitations and fatigue) that may be confounded with CAD. Our study examined sex differences in the association between mood and anxiety disorders and myocardial ischemia in patients with and without a CAD history presenting for exercise stress tests.Methods and Results: A total of 2342 patients (women n=760) completed a single photon emission computed tomographic exercise stress test (standard Bruce Protocol) and underwent a psychiatric interview (The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders) to assess mood and anxiety disorders. Ischemia was assessed using single photon emission computed tomography, with odds ratio used to calculate the effect of sex and mood/anxiety on the presence of ischemia during stress testing by CAD history in a stratified analyses, adjusted for relevant covariates. There was a sex by anxiety interaction with ischemia in those without a CAD history (P=0.015): women with anxiety were more likely to exhibit ischemia during exercise than women without anxiety (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.89). No significant effects were observed for men nor mood.Conclusions: Women with anxiety and no CAD history had higher rates of ischemia than women without anxiety. Results suggest that anxiety symptoms, many of which overlap with those of CAD, might mask CAD symptoms among women (but not men) and contribute to referral and diagnostic delays. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression and anxiety are common and co-morbid disorders that affect a significant proportion of students. Innovative prevention strategies targeting both conditions are needed to reduce their health burden and costs. ICare Prevent is such an innovative strategy and contains a transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based and mobile-supported intervention. It addresses common risk factors of depression and anxiety as part of a large EU-funded multi-country project* (ICare). Little is known about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention compared to care as usual (CAU) for college students. We hypothesize that ICare Prevent will be more (cost-)effective than CAU in the reduction of symptoms of depression and anxiety.Methods: A three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled superiority trial will be conducted comparing a guided and an unguided version of ICare Prevent with a control group receiving CAU. The trial will be open-label but outcome assessors will be blinded. A total of 252 college students (age ≥ 16 years) with subclinical symptoms of depression defined as a score ≥ 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and/or anxiety, defined as a score ≥ 5 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), will be included. Those meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder will be excluded. The primary outcome is change in disorder specific symptom severity from baseline to post-intervention. Secondary endpoints include self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms as well as time to onset of a mood or anxiety disorder until 12-month follow-up. Societal costs and quality of life will be assessed to estimate the intervention's cost-effectiveness compared to CAU.Discussion: Transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based prevention could be a (cost-)effective approach to tackle the disease burden of depression and anxiety among college students.Trial Registration: Dutch trial register, NTR 6562 .

        <ab>Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with chronic biases in the allocation of attention and recollection of personal memories. Impaired flexibility in attention and autobiographical memory retrieval is seen to both maintain current symptoms and predict future depression. Development of innovative interventions to reduce maladaptive cognitive patterns and improve cognitive flexibility in the domain of memory may therefore advance current treatment approaches for depression. Memory specificity training and cognitive bias modification techniques have both shown some promise in improving cognitive flexibility. Here we outline plans for a trial of an innovative memory flexibility training programme, MemFlex, which advances current training techniques with the aim of improving flexibility of autobiographical memory retrieval. This trial seeks to estimate the efficacy of MemFlex, provide data on feasibility, and begin to explore mechanisms of change.Methods/design: We plan a single-blind, randomised, controlled, patient-level trial in which 50 individuals with MDD will complete either psychoeducation (n = 25) or MemFlex (n = 25). After completing pre-treatment measures and an orientation session, participants complete eight workbook-based sessions at home. Participants will then be assessed at post-treatment and at 3 month follow-up. The co-primary outcomes are depressive symptoms and diagnostic status at 3 month follow-up. The secondary outcomes are memory flexibility at post-treatment and number of depression free days at 3 month follow-up. Other process outcomes and mediators of any treatment effects will also be explored.Discussion: This trial will establish the efficacy of MemFlex in improving memory flexibility, and reducing depressive symptoms. Any effects on process measures related to relapse may also indicate whether MemFlex may be helpful in reducing vulnerability to future depressive episodes. The low-intensity and workbook-based format of the programme may improve access to psychological therapies, and, if encouraging, the results of this study will provide a platform for later-phase trials.Trial Registration: NCT02371291 (ClinicalTrials.gov), registered 9 February 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background/purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the correlations between the severity of alprazolam dependence and socio-demographic characteristics, the characteristics of alprazolam use, psychiatric comorbidity, and beliefs toward alprazolam use among long-term alprazolam users in Taiwan.Methods: A total of 148 long-term alprazolam users participated in this study. The Chinese version of the Severity of Dependence Scale was used to assess participants' severity of alprazolam dependence in the preceding month. Their socio-demographic characteristics, family function characteristics, dosage of prescribed alprazolam, duration of alprazolam use, alcohol use pattern, pain reliever and cigarette use pattern, severity of depressive symptoms, psychiatric diagnosis, and belief toward alprazolam use were investigated.Results: The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that a longer duration of alprazolam use, severe depressive symptoms, a high level of belief in the necessity of alprazolam treatment, and a high level of concern about the potential adverse consequences of alprazolam use were significantly associated with more severe alprazolam dependence.Conclusion: Doctors should closely monitor the severity of alprazolam dependence among long-term users, especially patients' levels of depression, beliefs in the necessity of alprazolam treatment, and their concerns over the adverse consequences of continued treatment with alprazolam.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Experimenter's allegiance (EA) refers to a personal confidence of the superiority of a specific psychotherapy treatment. This factor has been linked with larger treatment effects in favor of the preferred treatment. However, various studies have displayed contradictory results between EA and the pattern of treatment effects. Aims: Using a systematic approach followed by meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the impact of an allegiance effect on the results of psychotherapeutic studies. Method: We considered the meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of different types of psychotherapies in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Eligible articles included meta-analyses of RCTs with at least one study showing evidence of EA (i.e., allegiant study). Effect sizes in allegiant RCTs were compared with non-allegiant using random and fixed models and a summary relative odds ratio (ROR) were calculated. Heterogeneity was quantified with the I2 metric. Results: A total of 30 meta-analyses including 240 RCTs were analyzed. The summary ROR was 1.31 [(95 % confidence interval (CI: 1.03-1.66) P = 0.30, I2 = 53 %] indicating larger effects when allegiance exists. The impact of allegiance did not differ significantly (P &gt; 0.05) when we compared psychiatric versus medical outcomes. Allegiance effect was significant for all forms of psychotherapy except for cognitive behavioral therapy. Moreover, the impact of allegiance was significant only when the treatment integrity of delivered psychotherapy was not assessed. Allegiance effect was even stronger where the experimenter was also both the developer of the preferred treatment and supervised or trained the therapists. No significant differences were found between allegiant and non-allegiant studies in terms of overall quality of studies. Conclusions: Experimenter's allegiance influences the effect sizes of psychotherapy RCTs and can be considered non-financial conflict of interest introducing a form of optimism bias, especially since blinding is problematic in this kind of research. A clear reporting of EA in every single study should be given an opportunity to investigators of minimizing its overestimation effects.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A variety of psychological interventions to treat depressive disorders have been developed and are used in primary care. In a systematic review, we compared the effectiveness of psychological treatments grouped by theoretical background, intensity of contact with the health care professional, and delivery mode for depressed patients in this setting. Methods: Randomized trials comparing a psychological treatment with usual care, placebo, another psychological treatment, pharmacotherapy, or a combination treatment in adult depressed primary care patients were identified by database searches up to December 2013. We performed both conventional pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect evidence. Outcome measures were response to treatment (primary outcome), remission of symptoms, post-treatment depression scores and study discontinuation. Results: A total of 37 studies with 7,024 patients met the inclusion criteria. Among the psychological treatments investigated in at least 150 patients face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; OR 1.80; 95 % credible interval 1.35-2.39), face-to-face counselling and psychoeducation (1.65; 1.27-2.13), remote therapist lead CBT (1.87; 1.38-2.53), guided self-help CBT (1.68; 1.22-2.30) and no/minimal contact CBT (1.53; 1.07-2.17) were superior to usual care or placebo, but not face-to-face problem-solving therapy and face-to-face interpersonal therapy. There were no statistical differences between psychological treatments apart from face-to-face interpersonal psychotherapy being inferior to remote therapist-lead CBT (0.60; 0.37-0.95). Remote therapist-led (0.86; 0.21-3.67), guided self-help (0.93; 0.62-1.41) and no/minimal contact CBT (0.85; 0.54-1.36) had similar effects as face-to-face CBT. Conclusions: The limited available evidence precludes a sufficiently reliable assessment of the comparative effectiveness of psychological treatments in depressed primary care patients. Findings suggest that psychological interventions with a cognitive behavioral approach are promising, and primarily indirect evidence indicates that it applies also when they are delivered with a reduced number of therapist contacts or remotely.

        <ab>Background: One in three people with a chronic somatic disease suffer from a comorbid mental disorder. Most common comorbidities are depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders. These lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality, and a deterioration of quality of life and healthcare costs. Treatment of mental disorders is of great importance, but the waiting time for outpatient individual psychotherapy can be up to six months in Germany. Group therapy has comparable treatment effects and is considerably more economic than individual therapy; however, it is still almost unused in the outpatient care system. The introduction of a stepped care approach, such as attending a group program before individual therapy, could improve this issue. For this purpose we developed a group program (STEpS), and its efficacy will be evaluated in this study.Methods/design: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group program for patients with somatic diseases and depressive or adjustment disorders, compared to a wait-list control group. A total of 128 adults with any chronic somatic disease and comorbid depression or adjustment disorder will be recruited in our outpatient clinic, and will be randomly assigned to participate in the group program immediately after contacting the clinic (intervention group) or after a waiting period of four months (wait-list control group). Primary outcomes will be self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms. Secondary outcomes will be self-reported psychological distress, changes in experience and behavior, health-related quality of life, state of self-esteem and subjective need for therapy. Assessments will take place at baseline, 10 weeks (post-treatment) and 18 weeks (follow-up) after randomization. Additionally, treatment acceptance and psychotherapeutic process will be assessed after each session.Discussion: This study investigates whether the CBT group program is an effective treatment to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms and psychological distress in these patients. If the group program is effective, it could be implemented as a treatment option prior to individual outpatient therapy. These results will contribute to improving outpatient care for mental disorders in patients with somatic diseases.Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00005140 (27 August 2013).</ab>

        <ab>The dynamics of adolescence require adjustments in psychiatric treatment because of the challenges of this developmental stage in life. This column describes the Day Hospital for Adolescents (DHA) of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade, Serbia, which was established in December 2007. The DHA is a holistic program for the treatment of youths ages 15-25 with emotional disorders. The multicomponent therapeutic program includes individual treatment, several group therapeutic activities, and work with patients' families and the school system. An evaluation of data obtained for 102 patients indicated that DHA treatment was associated with significant reductions in depression symptom severity and improved functioning. The adolescents reported a high level of treatment satisfaction. The results suggest that a multicomponent day hospital is an effective treatment modality for adolescents with emotional disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The perspectives of mental health consumers and carers are increasingly recognised as important to the development and conduct of research. However, research directions are still most commonly developed without consumer and carer input. This project aimed to establish priorities for mental health research driven by the views of consumers and carers in Australia.Method: The project was conducted in two studies. Firstly, a face-to-face discussion forum held in the Australian Capital Territory (Study 1; n = 25), followed by a national online survey (Study 2; n = 70). Participants in both studies were members of the community who identified as a mental health consumer, carer or both. In Study 1, participants developed topics for mental health research in small group discussions, then voted on which topics, developed across all groups and sorted into thematic areas, were a priority. An online survey was developed from these research topics. Study 2 participants were asked to rate topics on a 5-point priority scale and rank the relative importance of the highest-rated topics.Results: At the forum, 79 topics were generated and grouped into 14 thematic areas. Votes on priorities were spread across a large number of topics, with the greatest overall support for research relating to integrating care that is sensitive to past experiences of trauma into mental health service delivery (trauma-informed care). Survey responses were similarly spread, with the majority of research topics rated as important by at least 50% of participants and no clear individual priorities for research identified. Amongst items rated as important by approximately 80% of participants, key research areas included the delivery of services, and consumer and carer involvement.Conclusions: Australian mental health consumers and carers demonstrate a strong understanding of the mental health system and its inadequacies. Although clear specific priorities are difficult to establish, consistent areas of focus are services and the role consumers and carers can play in their improvement. However, for consumer and carer views to be at the forefront of research, it is important to regularly update research agendas and work in partnership across the whole research process.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression and anxiety are common psychiatric morbidity among breast cancer patient. There is a lack of study examining the correlation between depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL) with perceived social support (PSS) among breast cancer patients. This study aims to study the level of depression, anxiety, QoL and PSS among Malaysian breast cancer women over a period of 12 months and their associations at baseline, 6 and 12 months.Methods: It is a 12 months prospective cohort study. Two hundred and twenty one female patients were included in the study. They were assessed at the time of diagnosis, 6 months and 12 month using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), Version 3.0 of the EORTC Study Group and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The information of age, ethnicity, types of treatment, and staging of cancer were collected.Results: The HADS anxiety and depression subscales scores of the subjects were relatively low. The level of anxiety reduced significantly at 6 and 12 months (Baseline - 6 months, p = 0.002; Baseline - 12 months, p &lt; 0.001). There were no changes in the level of depression over the study period. The global status of QoL and MSPSS scores were relatively high. Correlation between the global status of QoL and MSPSS for the study subjects was positive (Spearman's rho = 0.31-0.36). Global status of QoL and MSPSS scores were negatively correlated with anxiety and depression.Conclusion: Malaysian breast cancer women had relatively better QoL with lower level of anxiety and depression. Perceived social support was an important factor for better QoL and low level of psychological distress. It reflects the importance of attention on activities that enhance and maintain the social support system for breast cancer patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Stroke survivors encounter emotional problems in the chronic phase after stroke. Post-stroke depressive symptoms have major impact on health-related quality of life (HRQol) and lead to increased hospitalization and therefore substantial healthcare costs. We present a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility evaluation of a cognitive behavioural therapy augmented with occupational and movement therapy to support patients with a stroke with depressive symptoms in goal-setting and goal attainment (augmented CBT) in comparison with a computerized cognitive training program (CogniPlus) as a control intervention.Methods: A trial-based economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 12 months. Stroke patients (aged 18+ years) with signs of depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - subscale depression &gt; 7) were eligible to participate. Primary outcomes were the HADS and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) based on the three-level five-dimensional EuroQol (EQ-5D-3 L). Missing data were handled through mean imputation (costs) and multiple imputation (HADS and EuroQol), and costs were bootstrapped. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of baseline assumptions.Results: Sixty-one patients were included. The average total societal costs were not significantly different between the control group (€9,998.3) and the augmented CBT group (€8,063.7), with a 95 % confidence interval (-5,284, 1,796). The augmented CBT intervention was less costly and less effective from a societal perspective on the HADS, and less costly and slightly more effective in QALYs, in comparison with the control treatment. The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses provided greater effects and fewer costs for the augmented CBT group, and fewer effects and costs for the HADS. Based on a willingness to pay (WTP) level of €40,000 per QALY, the augmented CBT intervention had a 76 % chance of being cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of results.Conclusion: The stroke-specific augmented CBT intervention did not show convincing cost-effectiveness results. In addition to other literature, this study provided new insights into the potential cost-effectiveness of an adjusted cognitive behavioural therapy intervention. However, as our study showed a 76 % chance of being cost-effective for one outcome measure (QALY) and did not provide convincing cost-effectiveness results on the HADS we recommend further research in a larger population.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and abdominal pain of functional origin (AP) are common gastrointestinal disorders in children, which are associated with increased risk for depression and disability. Both symptom severity and coping with symptoms may contribute to these outcomes. We hypothesized that children with AP use different coping strategies compared with those with IBD for a number of reasons, including the fact that fewer treatment options are available to them. We also examined whether coping was related to depression and functional disability beyond the contributions of symptom severity.Methods: The study method included secondary data analysis of 2 existing data sets including 200 children with AP (73% girls, mean age 11.2 years) and 189 children with IBD (49% girls, mean age 13.8 years).Results: Compared with patients with IBD, patients with AP reported more use of coping strategies of self-isolation, behavioral disengagement, and catastrophizing, as well as problem solving and seeking social support. Multivariate analyses revealed that, in both samples, ≥1 coping strategies were associated with depression and functional disability, independent of symptom severity, and controlling for age and sex. In IBD, symptoms were not a significant predictor of depression but coping was. Catastrophizing predicted depression and disability in both samples.Conclusions: Patients with AP report more frequent use of several of the coping strategies we measured compared with patients with IBD. Certain types of coping, particularly catastrophizing, were associated with greater depression and functional disability in both groups. Clinicians should be aware of maladaptive coping, which may be a risk factor for poor psychosocial and functional outcomes in both patient groups.</ab>

        <ab>Background: People living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from high rates of mental illness; but targeted effective interventions are limited, especially in developing countries. High penetration of smartphone usage and widespread acceptance of social media applications provide an unprecedented opportunity for mobile-based health interventions (mHealth interventions) in resource-limited settings like China. The current report describes the design and sample characteristics of the Run4Love randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at improving mental health in PLWH in China.Methods: A total of 300 PLWH with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited and randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course delivered by the enhanced WeChat platform (for 3 months) and were motivated to engage in physical activities. Progress of the participants was automatically tracked and monitored with timely feedback and rewards. The control group received a brochure on nutrition for PLWH in addition to standard care. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months using tablets. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms measured by the scale of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES-D). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, chronic stress measured with biomarker of hair cortisol, and other measures of stress and depression, self-efficacy, coping, HIV-related stigma, physical activity, and patient satisfaction. Mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the intervention effects.Discussion: The Run4Love study is among the first efforts to develop and evaluate a multicomponent and integrated mHealth intervention to improve the mental health and quality of life of PLWH. Once proven effective, Run4Love could be scaled up and potentially integrated into the routine case management of PLWH and adapted to other populations with chronic diseases.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry - ChiCTR-IPR-17012606 , registered on 07 September 2017.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE The study compared delays in seeking general medical care among adults with serious mental illness and a general population sample. Associations of delays with health status and use of emergency department services among individuals with serious mental illness were also assessed. METHODS Data for 271 persons with serious mental illness (clinic sample) and 40,016 participants in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS sample) were compared. RESULTS Fifty-three percent of the clinic sample and 13% of the NHIS sample reported delays, most because of difficulties accessing services. In the clinic sample, delays were associated with receipt of routine care at a public clinic, rather than a physician's office; more severe depressive symptoms; and functional difficulties. Delays were also associated with poorer health status and use of emergency department services. CONCLUSIONS Integration of services as envisioned in the Affordable Care Act and targeted case management may reduce delays among individuals with serious mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The objectives of the systematic review were to estimate the prevalence and correlates of criminal behavior, contacts with the criminal justice system, and victimization among homeless adults with severe mental illness.Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science were searched for published empirical investigations of prevalence and correlates of criminal behavior, contacts with the justice system, and episodes of victimization in the target population.Results: The search yielded 21 studies. Fifteen examined prevalence of contacts with the criminal justice system; lifetime arrest rates ranged between 62.9% and 90.0%, lifetime conviction rates ranged between 28.1% and 80.0%, and lifetime incarceration rates ranged between 48.0% and 67.0%. Four studies examined self-reported criminal behavior, with 12-month rates ranging from 17.0% to 32.0%. Six studies examined the prevalence of victimization, with lifetime rates ranging between 73.7% and 87.0%. Significant correlates of criminal behavior and contacts with the justice system included criminal history, high perceived need for medical services, high intensity of mental health service use, young age, male gender, substance use, protracted homelessness, type of homelessness (street or shelter), and history of conduct disorder. Significant correlates of victimization included female gender, history of child abuse, and depression.Conclusions: Rates of criminal behavior, contacts with the criminal justice system, and victimization among homeless adults with severe mental illness are higher than among housed adults with severe mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The efficacy of psychodynamic therapies for depression remains open to debate because of a paucity of high-quality studies. The authors compared the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy with that of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), hypothesizing nonsignificant differences and the noninferiority of psychodynamic therapy relative to CBT.Method: A total of 341 adults who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode and had Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores ≥14 were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of individual manualized CBT or short-term psychodynamic supportive therapy. Severely depressed patients (HAM-D score &gt;24) also received antidepressant medication according to protocol. The primary outcome measure was posttreatment remission rate (HAM-D score ≤7). Secondary outcome measures included mean posttreatment HAM-D score and patient-rated depression score and 1-year follow-up outcomes. Data were analyzed with generalized estimating equations and mixed-model analyses using intent-to-treat samples. Noninferiority margins were prespecified as an odds ratio of 0.49 for remission rates and a Cohen's d value of 0.30 for continuous outcome measures.Results: No statistically significant treatment differences were found for any of the outcome measures. The average posttreatment remission rate was 22.7%. Noninferiority was shown for posttreatment HAM-D and patient-rated depression scores but could not be demonstrated for posttreatment remission rates or any of the follow-up measures.Conclusions: The findings extend the evidence base of psychodynamic therapy for depression but also indicate that time-limited treatment is insufficient for a substantial number of patients encountered in psychiatric outpatient clinics.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To explore how psychologically vulnerable citizens experienced performing their everyday-life activities, identify activities experienced as particularly challenging and evaluate the significance of the Acceptance and Commitment Theory-based (ACT)-based program, Well-being in Daily Life, had on the participants everyday-life activities. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants from the Well-being in Daily Life program. Data were analysed using Systematic Text Condensation. Results and Conclusion: The participants experienced anxiety, fatigue, lack of structure, and chaos when performing their everyday-life activities; in addition to being uncertain about the limitations of their own resources. Furthermore, balancing between demands and resources was challenging, also leading to uncertainty and identity conflicts that contributed to the participants' concerns about re-entering the workforce. The program enabled the participants to develop social skills and trust which contributed to providing the participants with confidence, individually-tailored-possibilities for developing new competencies and courage; thus, facilitating their recovery process.</ab>

        <ab>Therapeutic doll making can hold diverse functions for clients in therapy, particularly for those clients who are working through complex trauma histories. Recent literature pertaining to the treatment of complex trauma suggests that talking treatments have their limits; supplementary therapeutic approaches that focus on sensory, physical, somatic, and body-oriented processes may be necessary. These include art therapy and various expressive modalities such as doll making. This article describes a series of six dolls created by a woman diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder resulting from child sexual abuse and family violence. The case illustrates significant therapeutic benefits of doll making in healing from complex trauma.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Norwegian health, care, and welfare services are experiencing increased demands to deliver services that are safe, effective, of high quality, and that ensure user involvement. Yet, evidence-based treatment for common disorders such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and behavioral problems in children are not regularly used in clinical practice in Norway. Possible explanations for this are that many standard, evidence-based treatments may have difficulty addressing the complexity and comorbidity of referred children and the fact that children's treatment needs often shift during treatment. The Modular Approach to Therapy for children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma and Conduct problems (MATCH-ADTC) was designed to address these challenges and reduce some of the barriers to therapists' use of evidence-based treatment in their practice.Methods/design: Participants will include 280 children (aged 6-14.5 years at intake) who receive treatment in child and adolescent mental health outpatient clinics in Norway, and their families. Families are randomly assigned to either the experimental group receiving treatment from therapists trained in MATCH, or to the comparison group receiving treatment from therapists delivering treatment as usual (TAU). Data on children's symptomology, child and family functioning, demographics, background information, and mental health outcomes are collected as well as frequent feedback on treatment response, plus video-recordings of treatment sessions and implementation quality scores from each participating clinic. Questionnaires are administered in six waves.Discussion: MATCH has been tested in the US with promising results, but we do not know whether this treatment approach will produce similar results in Norway. The implications of this study are 1. Possibly better treatment outcomes and/or more efficient improvements for children and families treated in mental health outpatient clinics in Norway 2. Clinicians learning to use more evidence-based practices in their treatment 3. Implementation of standard procedures for obtaining feedback from children and families and sharing the feedback with clinicians 4. Increased understanding, at the end of the trial, of whether introducing MATCH improves outcomes for children and families treated in mental health outpatient clinics TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, registration number: ISRCTN24029895 .

        <ab>Objective: To address the gaps between need and access, and between treatment guidelines and their implementation for mental illness, through capacity building of front-line health workers.Methods: Following a learning needs assessment, work-based continuing education courses in evidence-supported psychotherapies were developed for front-line workers in underserviced community settings. The 5-hour courses on the fundamentals of cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, motivational interviewing, and dialectical behaviour therapy each included videotaped captioned simulations, interactive lesson plans, and clinical practice behaviour reminders. Two courses, sequentially offered in 7 underserviced settings, were subjected to a mixed methods evaluation. Ninety-three nonmedical front-line workers enrolled in the program. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess pre- and postintervention changes in knowledge and self-efficacy. Qualitative data from 5 semistructured focus groups with 25 participants were also analyzed.Results: Significant pre- and postintervention changes in knowledge (P &lt; 0.001) were found in course completers. Counselling self-efficacy improved in participants who took the first course offered (P = 0.001). Dropouts were much less frequent in peer-led, small-group learning than in a self-directed format. Qualitative analysis revealed improved confidence, morale, self-reported practice behaviour changes, and increased comfort in working with difficult clients.Conclusion: This work-based, multimodal, interactive, interprofessional curriculum for knowledge translation of psychotherapeutic techniques is feasible and helpful. A peer-led group format is preferred over self-directed learning. Its application can build capacity of front-line health workers in helping patients who suffer from common mental disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Anxiety and depression often co-exist. These disorders are under-diagnosed and under-treated, specifically among older people, and lead to increased use of health and social care services and raised mortality. Older people report a reluctance to present to their GP with depression or anxiety symptoms due to perceived stigma about mental health problems, lack of acceptable treatments and the prioritising of physical health problems. Third sector organisations, who work closely with older people in the community, are well-placed to provide additional support. We developed a brief intervention based on principles of Behavioural Activation, with encouragement to participate in a group activity, for delivery by Support Workers from AgeUK. The aim of the study was to examine whether this brief intervention could be delivered to older people with anxiety and/or depression, with sufficient fidelity, and whether this approach was acceptable to patients, GPs and AgeUK Support Workers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with older people with self-reported anxiety and/or depression (who received the intervention), Support Workers and GPs to assess acceptability of the intervention and impact on routine care. A constant comparative approach was used to analyse the data. Intervention sessions between Support Workers and older people were digitally recorded and reviewed by the research team to assess fidelity. Results: The Support Workers delivered the intervention with fidelity; access to the training maual and ongoing supervision were important. Older people found the intervention acceptable and valued the one-to-one support they received; group activities suggested by Support Workers were not valued by all. GPs recognised the need for additional support for vulnerable older people, but acknowledged they could not provide this support. Participation in the study did not impact on GP routine care, other than responding to the calls from the study team about risk of self-harm. Conclusions: Support Workers within AgeUK, can be recruited and trained to deliver an intervention, based on the principles of Behavioural Activation, to older people with anxiety and/or depression. The training and supervision model used in the study was acceptable to Support Workers, and the intervention was acceptable to older people and GPs. This model has the potential to contribute to improving the support and care of older people in primary care with anxiety and depression. Further testing is required in a full trial.

        <ab>Background: Studies on healthy individuals that show minor signs of distress and depression-but that are not significant enough to be debilitating or to report to the hospital for treatment-are rare. Our primary objective was to measure the prevalence of depressive symptoms and sociodemographic correlates among healthy women 18 years and above in urban Accra, Ghana.Method: We used secondary data from the Women's Health Study of Accra, Wave 1 (WHSA-1), a large scale, analytic, cross-sectional study conducted in Accra, Ghana involving 3183 women. The presence or absence of depressive symptoms within the past 30 days was estimated from the average score on three common symptoms of depression: sleep, anxiety, and sadness. The explanatory variables were age-group, socioeconomic level, marital status, ethnicity, religion, education, employment, and parity. Frequencies and means were used to summarize categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the predictors of depressive symptoms.Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms within the previous 30 days was 26.5% (95% CI: 25.0-28.1). Women 55 years and older were more likely than women between the ages of 18 and 24 to experience depressive symptoms (AOR 2.8, 95% CI: 2.0-4.0, p &lt; 0.001), whilst women between the ages of 35 and 54 were 1.95 times more likely than women between the ages of 18 and 24 to experience depression (AOR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.40-2.70, p &lt; 0.001). Self-employed women were less likely to report depressive symptoms compared to the unemployed (AOR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.87, p &lt; 0.01). Akans were less likely to experience depressive symptoms compared to Ga women (AOR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.92, p &lt; 0.01). Non-orthodox Christians were more likely to report depressive symptoms compared to Orthodox Christians (AOR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.09-1.60, p &lt; 0.01).Conclusion: The prevalence of symptoms of depression among healthy urban Ghanaian women is high. Older women, those with low education, and unemployed women appear to be at higher risk for depression and therefore should be targeted for interventions. Groups at risk for depression-especially older adults or individuals under economic strain-should be targeted for mood assessment as part of routine medical care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cancer and its treatment can result in psychological distress in both adults with cancer and in their family caregivers. This psychological distress acts as a significant adverse factor in patient-caregiver dyads. The study purposes included: (i) to assess anxiety and depression in adults with cancer and their family caregivers, and examine the dyadic relationship of anxiety and depression in patient-caregiver dyads; (ii) to investigate factors that may modify these relationships; and (iii) to explore the impact of anxiety and depression on patient-caregiver dyad quality of life (QOL).Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. Participants consisted of 641 patient-caregiver dyads. Participants completed a survey assessing adults with cancer-related, family caregiver-related, and family-related variables using a demographic/clinical information sheet. In addition, anxiety/depression and QOL were assessed by using the Chinese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and SF-12 respectively. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, subgroup analysis, and the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model.Results: Nearly one-third of participants had experienced anxiety and depression. Adults with cancer and family caregivers experienced a similar degree of anxiety and depression. Correlations (r) of anxiety and depression between patient-caregiver dyads ranged from 0.25 to 0.32. Various factors influencing the anxiety and depression relationship between patient-caregiver dyads were identified, including adults with cancer-related (e.g., age, gender, marital status, level of being informed about the disease, different types of cancer and treatment), family caregiver-related (e.g., being the spouse of a patient, duration in their role as a family caregiver, and amount of time spent on caregiving each day), and family-related (family relationship pre- and post-cancer, financial burden on the family due to cancer treatment) variables. To some extent, both actor and partner effects were identified for anxiety and depression on the QOL of patient-caregiver dyads.Conclusions: Study findings call attention to anxiety and depression, as well as related factors, in patient-caregiver dyads. The underlined essential components and focus of intervention, which will be developed to decrease psychological distress and improve QOL in patient-caregiver dyads, included individual characteristics of patient-caregiver dyads, family relationship, and anxiety and depression in their counterparts.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mental health among adolescents is an important public health challenge. School health services perform central public health functions in Norwegian municipalities, where school nurses are uniquely positioned to educate and promote mental health among adolescents. MEST (MEST is not an acronym; MEST is a short version of the Norwegian word for coping) is a newly developed universal working strategy for school health services that aims to promote positive mental health literacy (MHL) and mental wellbeing in the adolescent population. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential outcome mean differences in positive MHL and mental wellbeing between adolescents who participated and those who did not participate in MEST over a school year.Methods: This study is based on cohort data collected from 357 adolescents (aged 15-21 years) in five Norwegian upper secondary schools at the beginning and end of the 2016/2017 school year. The data were analyzed by describing mean scores and estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) of MEST on positive MHL and mental wellbeing.Results: Positive MHL increased significantly more among the MEST participants compared to the non-MEST participants (p = .02). No significant change in mental wellbeing was found between MEST and non-MEST participants (p = .98). Estimating the ATE of MEST on positive MHL, the MEST participants showed a significant 2.1% increase (p = .04) in the potential outcome mean of positive MHL compared to the nonparticipants. Estimating the ATE of MEST on mental wellbeing, the girls who attended MEST exhibited a significant 9.7% increase (p = .03) in the potential outcome mean of mental wellbeing compared with the girls who did not attend MEST, while no significant change (p = .99) was detected among boys or the entire sample of both genders combined (p = .12).Conclusion: This study found a significant ATE of MEST on positive MHL and on mental wellbeing among girls. The results support further investments in studying MEST as a promising work strategy for school health services to promote adolescent mental health. This initial study of MEST may be used as a foundation for investing in future evaluations of MEST.</ab>

        <ab>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Examine whether cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improves sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as nightmares, nonsleep PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and psychosocial functioning. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH TWO ARMS: CBT-I and monitor-only waitlist control. SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five adults (31 females: [mean age 37 y (22-59 y)] with PTSD meeting research diagnostic criteria for insomnia, randomly assigned to CBT-I (n = 29; 22 females) or monitor-only waitlist control (n = 16; nine females). INTERVENTIONS: Eight-session weekly individual CBT-I delivered by a licensed clinical psychologist or a board-certified psychiatrist. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Measures included continuous monitoring of sleep with diary and actigraphy; prepolysomnography and postpolysomnography and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); and pre, mid, and post self-report questionnaires, with follow-up of CBT-I participants 6 mo later. CBT-I was superior to the waitlist control condition in all sleep diary outcomes and in polysomnography-measured total sleep time. Compared to waitlist participants, CBT-I participants reported improved subjective sleep (41% full remission versus 0%), disruptive nocturnal behaviors (based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Addendum), and overall work and interpersonal functioning. These effects were maintained at 6-mo follow-up. Both CBT-I and waitlist control participants reported reductions in PTSD symptoms and CAPS-measured nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved sleep in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, with durable gains at 6 mo. Overall psychosocial functioning improved following CBT-I. The initial evidence regarding CBT-I and nightmares is promising but further research is needed. Results suggest that a comprehensive approach to treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder should include behavioral sleep medicine.

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Many children who lost parents in the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, China, experienced symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. This randomized controlled study compared the treatment effectiveness of short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with a general supportive intervention and with a control group of nontreatment. METHODS Thirty-two Chinese adolescents were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Participants were compared for psychological resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), symptoms of PTSD (Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale), and depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) at baseline, after treatment, and three-month follow-up. RESULTS CBT was effective in reducing PTSD and depressive symptoms and improved psychological resilience. General support was more effective than no intervention in improving psychological resilience. CONCLUSIONS Short-term CBT group intervention seems to be a robust intervention for natural disaster victims. Short-term CBT group intervention was more effective than the general supportive intervention and the no-treatment group in enhancing psychological resilience and reducing PTSD and depression among adolescents who had lost parents in the earthquake. The general supportive intervention was effective only in improving psychological resilience.</ab>

        <ab>Participants with symptoms of depression received either eight sessions of therapist-delivered email cognitive behaviour therapy (eCBT;n=37), or eight sessions of computerised CBT self-administered treatment (cCBT;n=43). At post-treatment participants completed a questionnaire to determine what they found satisfying about their online treatment. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was employed to report outcomes. A sample of 25 participants(eCBTn=10; cCBTn=15) completed the satisfaction questionnaire. Both groups were satisfied with accessing and using an online treatment and that they had self-control over their treatment. Perceived anonymity was important for the eCBT group. For the cCBT group they found the treatment user-friendly, engaging and also a source of learning. Both groups disliked that the online treatment could at times be complicated and impersonal.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. We sought to determine whether severe psychological distress (SPD) and serious mental illnesses (SMIs) are associated with a specific set of chronic medical conditions (CMCs) and the association between SPD–SMIs and increasing levels of medical multimorbidity and complexity (i.e., from 1 to 3 or more CMCs). Methods. We used data from 3 administrations (2008–2010) of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health collected from 110 455 adult participants. We used binary and ordinal logistic regressions adjusting for sociodemographics and substance abuse to examine the associations between SPD–SMIs and increasing levels of multimorbidity. Results. SPD–SMI was associated with higher probabilities for many CMCs generally, but we found no specific pattern for any class of conditions for SPD–SMIs and multimorbidity. The association between SPD–SMIs and multimorbidity strengthened as the number of CMCs increased. Conclusions. The finding of no discernible risk pattern for any specific CMC grouping supports broad medical assessment strategies and closely coordinated primary and behavioral health care for those with SPD–SMIs, as called for in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined the prevalence and correlates of co-occurring obesity and diabetes among community mental health program members.Methods: Medical screenings of 457 adults with serious mental illnesses were conducted by researchers and peer wellness specialists in four U.S. states. Body mass index was measured directly. Diabetes was assessed via glycosylated hemoglobin and interview self-report. Multivariable logistic regression analysis examined associations with known predictors.Results: In the sample, 59% were obese, 25% had diabetes, and 19% had both conditions. When gender, diagnosis, and site were controlled, co-occurring diabetes and obesity was almost three times as likely among African Americans (OR=2.93) as among participants from other racial groups and half as likely among smokers as among nonsmokers (OR=.58). Older persons and those with poorer self-rated physical health also were more likely to have these co-occurring conditions.Conclusions: Results support the need for culturally competent treatment and for smoking cessation options with sensitivity to the potential for weight gain.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors evaluated a sequential treatment strategy of fluoxetine and relapse-prevention cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to determine effects on remission and relapse in youths with major depressive disorder.Method: Youths 8-17 years of age with major depression were treated openly with fluoxetine for 6 weeks. Those with an adequate response (defined as a reduction of 50% or more on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised [CDRS-R]) were randomly assigned to receive continued medication management alone or continued medication management plus CBT for an additional 6 months. The CBT was modified to address residual symptoms and was supplemented by well-being therapy. Primary outcome measures were time to remission (with remission defined as a CDRS-R score of 28 or less) and rate of relapse (with relapse defined as either a CDRS-R score of 40 or more with a history of 2 weeks of symptom worsening, or clinical deterioration).Results: Of the 200 participants enrolled in acute-phase treatment, 144 were assigned to continuation treatment with medication management alone (N=69) or medication management plus CBT (N=75). During the 30-week continuation treatment period, time to remission did not differ significantly between treatment groups (hazard ratio=1.26, 95% CI=0.87, 1.82). However, the medication management plus CBT group had a significantly lower risk of relapse than the medication management only group (hazard ratio=0.31, 95% CI=0.13, 0.75). The estimated probability of relapse by week 30 was lower with medication management plus CBT than with medication management only (9% compared with 26.5%).Conclusions: Continuation-phase relapse-prevention CBT was effective in reducing the risk of relapse but not in accelerating time to remission in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: It is unclear whether community treatment orders (CTOs) for people with severe mental illnesses can reduce health service use, or improve clinical and social outcomes. Randomized controlled trials of CTOs are rare because of ethical and logistical concerns. This meta-analysis updates available evidence.Method: A systematic literature search was performed of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register, Science Citation Index, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase to November 2013. Inclusion criteria were studies comparing CTOs with standard care including those where control subjects received voluntary care, for most of the trial.Results: Three studies provided 749 subjects for the meta-analysis. Two compared compulsory treatment with entirely voluntary care, while the third had control subjects receiving voluntary treatment for the bulk of the time. Compared with control subjects, CTOs did not reduce readmissions (risk ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16) or bed days (mean difference [MD] -16.36; 95% CI -40.8 to 8.05) in the subsequent 12 months (n = 749). Moreover, there were no significant differences in psychiatric symptoms (standardized MD -0.03; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; n = 331) or the Global Assessment of Functioning (MD -1.36; 95% CI -4.07 to 1.35; n = 335). Only including the 2 studies that compared compulsory treatment with entirely voluntary care made no difference to the results.Conclusions: CTOs may not lead to significant differences in readmission, social functioning, or symptomatology, compared with standard care. Their use should be kept under review.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: There is widespread support for primary care to help address growing mental health care demands. Incentives and disincentives are widely used in the design of health care systems to help steer toward desired goals. The absence of a conceptual model to help understand the range of factors that influence the provision of primary mental health care inspired a scoping review of the literature. Understanding the incentives that promote and the disincentives that deter treatment for depression and anxiety in the primary care context will help to achieve goals of greater access to mental health care.Method: A review of the literature was conducted to answer the question, how are incentives and disincentives conceptualized in studies investigating the treatment of common mental disorders in primary care? A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar was undertaken using Arksey and O'Malley's 5-stage methodological framework for scoping reviews.Results: We identified 27 studies. A range of incentives and disincentives influence the success of primary mental health care initiatives to treat depression and anxiety. Six types of incentives and disincentives can encourage or discourage treatment of depression and anxiety in primary care: attitudes and beliefs, training and core competencies, leadership, organizational, financial, and systemic.Conclusions: Understanding that there are 6 different types of incentives that influence treatment for anxiety and depression in primary care may help service planners who are trying to promote improved mental health care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the developed world, yet broadly effective treatments remain elusive. Up to 40% of patients with depression are unresponsive to at least two trials of antidepressant medication and thus have 'treatment-resistant depression' (TRD). There is an urgent need for cost-effective, non-pharmacologic, evidence-based treatments for TRD. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an effective treatment for relapse prevention and residual depression in major depression, but has not been previously studied in patients with TRD in a large randomized trial. Methods/Design: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether MBCT is an effective augmentation of antidepressants for adults with MDD who failed to respond to standard pharmacotherapy. MBCT was compared to an active control condition, the Health-Enhancement Program (HEP), which incorporates physical activity, functional movement, music therapy and nutritional advice. HEP was designed as a comparator condition for mindfulness-based interventions to control for non-specific effects. Originally investigated in a non-clinical sample to promote stress reduction, HEP was adapted for a depressed population for this study. Individuals age 18 and older with moderate to severe TRD, who failed to respond to at least two trials of antidepressants in the current episode, were recruited to participate. All participants were taking antidepressants (Treatment as usual; TAU) at the time of enrollment. After signing an informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT or HEP condition. Participants were followed for 1 year and assessed at weeks 1-7, 8, 24, 36, and 52. Change in depression severity, rate of treatment response and remission after 8 weeks were the primary outcomes measured by the clinician-rated Hamilton Depression Severity Rating (HAM-D) 17-item scale. The participant-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomology (QIDS-SR) 16-item scale was the secondary outcome measure of depression severity, response, and remission. Discussion: Treatment-resistant depression entails significant morbidity and has few effective treatments. We studied the effect of augmenting antidepressant medication with MBCT, compared with a HEP control, for patients with TRD. Analyses will focus on clinician and patient assessment of depression, participants' clinical global impression change, employment and social functioning scores and quality of life and satisfaction ratings.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This 24-month study, conducted in The Netherlands, examined the feasibility of enhancing the effectiveness of assertive community treatment (ACT) by adding evidence-based interventions. METHODS: A total of 159 patients were randomly assigned to two ACT teams, one providing standard ACT (N585) and an ACT Plus team that also provided evidence-based interventions (N574): psychoeducation, family interventions, individual placement and support, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The interventions were conducted by psychologists and nurse practitioners working independently from the ACT team. RESULTS: Although most patients were judged eligible for each of the four interventions (range 65% to 89%), only 12 of the 74 patients (16%) successfully completed an intervention. Outcomes, such as use of inpatient care, for ACT Plus and standard ACT patients did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia should consider the feasibility of delivering evidence-based interventions to difficult-to-engage patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Mandated community treatment has been proposed as a mechanism to engage people with severe and persistent mental disorders in treatment. Recently, two approaches to mandate treatment through the courts have been highlighted: assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) and mental health court programs. This study examined levels of perceived coercion, procedural justice, and the impact of the program (mental health court or AOT) among participants in a community treatment system. METHODS Data were analyzed from interviews with former AOT participants who were no longer under court supervision (N=17) and with graduates of a mental health court program (N=35). The MacArthur Admission Experience Survey, created to measure perceived coercion, procedural justice, and program impact on hospital admission, was modified to include judges and case managers. RESULTS Mental health court graduates perceived significantly less coercion and more procedural justice in their interactions with the judge than did AOT participants. No significant difference was found between mental health court and AOT participants in perceptions of procedural justice in interactions with their case managers. Mental health court participants felt more respected and had more positive feelings about the program than did AOT participants. CONCLUSIONS Both mental health courts and AOT programs have potentially coercive aspects. Findings suggest that judges and case managers can affect participants' perceptions of these programs by the degree to which they demonstrate procedural justice, a process that may affect the long-term effects of the programs on individuals.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Approximately 20-30% of patients with cancer experience a clinically relevant level of emotional distress in response to disease and treatment. This in itself is alarming but it is even more problematic because it is often difficult for physicians and nurses to identify cancer patients who experience clinically relevant levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. This can result in persistent distress and can cause human suffering as well as costs for individuals and to the community.Methods: Applying a multi-disciplinary and design-oriented approach aimed at attaining new evidence-based knowledge in basic and applied psychosocial oncology, this protocol will evaluate an intervention to be implemented in clinical practice to reduce cancer patient anxiety and depression. A prospective randomized design will be used.The overarching goal of the intervention is to promote psychosocial health among patients suffering from cancer by means of self-help programmes delivered via an Internet platform. Another goal is to reduce costs for individuals and society, caused by emotional distress in response to cancer.Following screening to detect levels of patient distress, patients will be randomized to standard care or a stepped care intervention. For patients randomized to the intervention, step 1 will consist of self-help material, a chat forum where participants will be able to communicate with each other, and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section where they can ask questions and get answers from an expert. Patients in the intervention group who still report symptoms of anxiety or depression after access to step 1 will be offered step 2, which will consist of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered by a personal therapist. The primary end point of the study is patients' levels of anxiety and depression, evaluated longitudinally during and after the intervention.Discussion: There is a lack of controlled studies of the psychological and behavioral processes involved in this type of intervention for anxiety and depressive disorders. Since anxiety and depressive symptoms are relatively common in patients with cancer and the availability of adequate support efforts is limited, there is a need to develop evidence-based stepped care for patients with cancer, to be delivered via the Internet.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01630681.</ab>

        <ab>STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the patterns of insomnia and sleep-related movement from ages 4.5 to 9 years, their concurrent associations with mental health symptoms in childhood, and the longitudinal associations of sleep-problem persistence with mental health symptoms at ages 9 and 18 years. DESIGN: A 14-year prospective follow-up study. Assessments included maternal report on the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire at ages 4.5 and 9, and child mental health symptoms via maternal report at age 4.5, multi-informant (child, teacher, mother) report at age 9, and adolescent report at age 18. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 396 children (51% female). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep problems were more common at age 4.5 than 9; symptoms of insomnia and abnormal sleep movement both had persistence rates of 9-10%. At age 4.5, insomnia was associated with hostile-aggressive and hyperactive-distractible behavior, but there were no significant associations for sleep movement. At age 9, both insomnia and sleep movement were associated with symptoms of depression, externalizing, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Insomnia persistence was associated with symptoms of depression, externalizing, and ADHD at age 9 and anxiety and externalizing at age 18; sleep- movement persistence was associated with externalizing and ADHD at age 9, and ADHD at age 18. The age 18 persistence effects for insomnia and anxiety and for sleep movement and ADHD were significant when controlling for earlier mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood insomnia and sleep movement are common and associated with mental health symptoms. Their persistence from middle to late childhood predicts associations with specific types of mental health symptoms at age 18. CITATION: Armstrong JM, Ruttle PL, Klein MH, Essex MJ, Benca RM.

        <ab>Objective: This article reviews the conceptual basis, definitions, and evolution of cognitive training approaches for the treatment of mental disorders.Method: The authors review the current state of the knowledge on cognitive training in psychiatric illnesses, and its neural and behavioral targets, and summarize the factors that appear to relate to a successful response, including learner characteristics that influence clinical outcome. They also discuss methodological issues relevant to the development and testing of cognitive training approaches, with the goal of creating maximally efficient and effective approaches to training. Finally, they identify gaps in existing knowledge and outline key research directions for the future.Results: While much of the early research has been conducted in schizophrenia, cognitive training has more recently been applied to a widening range of neuropsychiatric illnesses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, and substance use disorders. Cognitive training harnesses the inherent neuroplastic capacities of the brain, targeting neural system function across psychiatric disorders, thus improving the cognitive processes that play a role in emotion regulation, clinical symptoms, and adaptive community functioning.Conclusions: Cognitive training offers considerable promise, especially given the limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions in ameliorating cognitive deficits. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive training, predictors of response, generalization and real-world applicability, and approaches to dissemination in practice settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is used as a descriptive or diagnostic term and has generated many management guidelines weighting antidepressant (AD) therapy, but which may be an inappropriate paradigm for the nonmelancholic disorders where psychotherapy may be a more salient modality. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapy in patients whose nonmelancholic depressive condition had been resistant to at least 2 ADs.Method: Principal analyses compared 32 patients, diagnosed with a nonmelancholic depression who received 12 weeks of psychological therapy, with a small control group. Comparative analyses failed to find a distinct therapeutic effect, leading to an extension study pursuing candidate explanatory factors for this lack of response, including psychosocial factors.Results: While our sample showed a 41% response and 22% remission rate to psychotherapy, their improvement pattern was similar to the control group, thus arguing against any specific therapeutic benefit. Explanatory factors nominated by the treating psychologist weighted personality issues for 35% of the patients, distal stressors for 22%, and comorbid anxiety conditions for 18%. When sample members were compared with an age- and sex-matched sample of patients with nonmelancholic depression who improved distinctly during a similar 12-week period, rates of such putative personality, stress, and anxiety risk factors did not differ, arguing against the likelihood of these factors compromising improvement.Conclusions: Patients with nonmelancholic TRD also failed to demonstrate a clear response to a psychotherapeutic approach, while our pursuit of clinically explanatory variables was not supported empirically.</ab>

We hypothesized that CBT-AD would improve adherence; depression; and, secondarily, hemoglobin A1c (A1C).Research Design and Methods: Eighty-seven adults with unipolar depression and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes received enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU), including medication adherence, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and lifestyle counseling; a provider letter documented psychiatric diagnoses. Those randomized to the intervention arm also received 9-11 sessions of CBT-AD.Results: Immediately after acute treatment (4 months), adjusting for baseline, CBT-AD had 20.7 percentage points greater oral medication adherence on electronic pill cap (95% CI -31.14 to -10.22, P = 0.000); 30.2 percentage points greater SMBG adherence through glucometer downloads (95% CI -42.95 to -17.37, P = 0.000); 6.44 points lower depression scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (95% CI 2.33-10.56, P = 0.002); 0.74 points lower on the Clinical Global Impression (95% CI 0.16-1.32, P = 0.01); and 0.72 units lower A1C (95% CI 0.29-1.15, P = 0.001) relative to ETAU. Analyses of 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-up time points indicated that CBT-AD maintained 24.3 percentage points higher medication adherence (95% CI -38.2 to -10.3, P = 0.001); 16.9 percentage points greater SMBG adherence (95% CI -33.3 to -0.5, P = 0.043); and 0.63 units lower A1C (95% CI 0.06-1.2, P = 0.03) after acute treatment ended. For depression, there was some evidence of continued improvement posttreatment, but no between-group differences.Conclusions: CBT-AD is an effective intervention for adherence, depression, and glycemic control, with enduring and clinically meaningful benefits for diabetes self-management and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and depression.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Preventive efforts targeting childhood anxiety and depression symptoms have the potential to alter the developmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders across the lifespan. Substantial previous research suggests that modifiable parenting factors such as parental aversiveness and over-involvement are associated with childhood anxiety, depressive and internalising symptoms, indicating that parents can play a critical role in prevention. The Parenting Resilient Kids study is a new evidence-based online parenting program designed to prevent anxiety and depression problems in primary school-aged children by reducing family-based risk factors and enhancing protective factors through increased positive interactions between parent and child.Methods/design: The current study is a parallel group superiority randomised controlled trial with parent-child dyads randomised to the intervention or active-control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will receive the Parenting Resilient Kids program consisting of a feedback report on parenting behaviours and up to 12 interactive online modules personalised based on responses to the parent survey. The active-control group will receive a standardised package of online educational materials about child development and wellbeing. The trial website is programmed to run a stratified random allocation sequence (based on parent gender) to determine group membership. We aim to recruit 340 parent-child dyads (170 dyads per group). We hypothesise that the intervention group will show greater improvement in parenting risk and protective factors from baseline to 3-month follow-up (primary outcome), which will in turn mediate changes in child depressive and anxiety symptoms from baseline to 12 and 24 months (co-primary outcomes). We also hypothesise that the intervention group will show greater benefits from baseline to 3-, 12- and 24-month follow-up, with regard to: child depressive and anxiety symptoms (co-primary outcomes); and child and parent health-related quality of life, and overall family functioning (secondary outcomes).Discussion: This randomised controlled trial will examine the efficacy of the Parenting Resilient Kids program as a preventive intervention for anxiety and depression symptoms in primary school-aged children, as well as changes in child and parent health-related quality of life. Findings from this study will examine design features that render web-based prevention programs effective and the extent to which parents can be engaged and motivated to change through a minimally guided parenting program.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): Trial ID ACTRN12616000621415 Registered on 13 May 2016.

        <ab>Background: There is a strong evidence base for the benefits of parenting interventions for parents without severe mental illness (SMI). As the impact of maternal SMI can be significant on child development, mothers need support to maximise outcomes for themselves and their children. Some mothers with SMI require admission jointly with their baby to a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU), a psychiatric inpatient ward, for assessment and treatment. However, MBUs do not yet offer formally evaluated, evidence-based parenting interventions as a matter of routine. This paper describes a study to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a parenting and psychological intervention targeting the mother's and infant's wellbeing for mothers admitted to a MBU.Methods/design: This study is a multisite, single-blind feasibility trial with half the participants randomised to the Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme plus treatment as usual (TAU) and the other half randomised to TAU alone. Self-report and observer-rated assessments are collected at baseline, 10 weeks post-baseline and 6 months post-baseline. Participants are mothers admitted to a MBU in the Northwest of England or the Midlands. Participants are included if they are fluent in English to provide informed, written consent. Our objective is to determine whether we can recruit 66 women, randomise 60, and retain them in the intervention and study, and whether the intervention and study procedures are acceptable. As part of a nested process evaluation, qualitative interview data from trial participants and MBU staff will inform feasibility and acceptability. The feasibility of collecting data required to conduct an economic evaluation of the intervention will also be explored.Discussion: Although research has been conducted in relation to mothers with severe mental illness and MBUs, to our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability, uptake and retention alongside the potential efficacy of a parenting intervention for this population. This study is essential to examine the contextual challenges involved in this setting with this population and to identify any refinements required.Trial Registration: ISRCTN12765736 .

        <ab>Objective: Mental health in populations may be deteriorating, or it may be improving, but there is little direct evidence to support either possibility. Our objective was to examine secular trends in mental health indicators from national data sources.Methods: We used data (1994-2008) from the National Population Health Survey and from a series of cross-sectional studies (Canadian Community Health Survey) conducted in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007. We calculated population-weighted proportions and also generated sex-specific, age-standardized estimates of major depressive episode prevalence, distress, professionally diagnosed mood disorders, antidepressant use, self-rated perceived mental health, and self-rated stress.Results: Major depression prevalence did not change over time. No changes in the frequency of severe distress were seen. However, there were increases in reported diagnoses of mood disorders and an increasing proportion of the population reported that they were taking antidepressants. The proportion of the population reporting that their life was extremely stressful decreased, but the proportion reporting poor mental health did not change.Conclusions: Measures based on assessment of symptoms showed no evidence of change over time. However, the frequency of diagnosis and treatment appears to be increasing and perceptions of extreme stress are decreasing. These changes probably reflect changes in diagnostic practice, mental health literacy, or willingness to report mental health concerns. However, no direct evidence of changing mental health status was found.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To present a framework for assessing children's disaster reactions and mental health needs.Methods: We reviewed the relevant literature and clinical experience to identify information on assessment approaches in children and to construct an assessment framework based on disaster exposure.Results: Child disaster mental health assessment includes 2 components-screening and clinical evaluation-but these have not been fully explicated or distinguished in the literature. Screening can be used to assess large numbers of children across exposure groups. Clinical evaluation is appropriate for children who are directly exposed to a disaster, for those whose family members and (or) close associates are directly exposed, and for those who are identified through screening as being at risk for psychiatric disturbance. Clinical evaluation includes a full diagnostic assessment (posttraumatic stress disorder and other disorders) with the goals of identifying psychopathology, determining the need for clinical care, and guiding intervention planning and referral. Children with psychiatric conditions should be referred to treatment, while those with psychological distress but without psychiatric illness may benefit from psychosocial interventions.Conclusions: Screening is appropriate to identify children at risk for psychiatric disturbance who will need further evaluation to determine diagnosis. Screening should not be used to dictate treatment decisions. Children who screen positive for psychiatric risk should receive a full clinical evaluation. Children determined to be suffering from psychiatric disorders should receive, or be referred for, formal treatment. Children without psychiatric disorders may benefit from psychosocial interventions.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Studies investigating the relationship between head injury and subsequent psychiatric disorders often suffer from methodological weaknesses and show conflicting results. The authors investigated the incidence of severe psychiatric disorders following hospital contact for head injury. METHOD The authors used linkable Danish nationwide population-based registers to investigate the incidence of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, and organic mental disorders in 113,906 persons who had suffered head injuries. Data were analyzed by survival analysis and adjusted for gender, age, calendar year, presence of a psychiatric family history, epilepsy, infections, autoimmune diseases, and fractures not involving the skull or spine. RESULTS Head injury was associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.65, 95% CI=1.55-1.75), depression (IRR=1.59 95% CI=1.53-1.65), bipolar disorder (IRR=1.28, 95% CI=1.10-1.48), and organic mental disorders (IRR=4.39, 95% CI=3.86-4.99). This effect was larger than that of fractures not involving the skull or spine for schizophrenia, depression, and organic mental disorders, which suggests that the results were not merely due to accident proneness. Head injury between ages 11 and 15 years was the strongest predictor for subsequent development of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. The added risk of mental illness following head injury did not differ between individuals with and without a psychiatric family history. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study to date investigating head injury and subsequent mental illness. The authors demonstrated an increase in risk for all psychiatric outcomes after head injury. The effect did not seem to be solely due to accident proneness, and the added risk was not more pronounced in persons with a psychiatric family history.</ab>

        <ab>Background/purpose: Mental health promotion campaigns require a good understanding of public attitudes and mental health literacy. Few studies have investigated changes in these two aspects over time. We aimed to examine such changes and their associations with help-seeking preference in Taiwan.Methods: Data were extracted from the Taiwan Social Change Survey (1990, 1995, and 2000) based on national representative samples. Each wave of the surveys included four questions about attitudes toward severe mental illness, a case vignette describing depressive and anxiety symptoms to evaluate respondents' mental health literacy, and their preference of medical and/or informal help-seeking if they develop such symptoms. Mental and physical health statuses measured using the Chinese Health Questionnaire and self-reported chronic physical illnesses were included as covariates.Results: There were 2531, 2075, and 1892 respondents in the three waves of the surveys, respectively. During the 1990 s, approximately one in four to five Taiwanese held some misconceptions toward mental illness. The attitudes toward mental illness were generally not associated with medical or informal help-seeking preference after statistical adjustment. However, respondents viewing symptoms in the vignette as physical or mental in origin were more willing to seek help than those who saw these symptoms as not being an illness.Conclusion: Attribution of depressive and anxiety symptoms appeared to be more likely to influence help-seeking behaviors than attitudes toward mental illness. Enhancing public mental health literacy toward depression may help facilitate help-seeking in response to potential mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The interrelationships between research evidence and policy-making are complex. Different theoretical frameworks exist to explain general evidence-policy interactions. One largely unexplored element of these interrelationships is how evidence interrelates with, and influences, policy/political agenda-setting. This review aims to identify the elements and processes of theories, frameworks and models on interrelationships of research evidence and health policy-making, with a focus on actionability and agenda-setting in the context of mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Methods: A systematic review of theories was conducted based on the BeHeMOTh search method, using a tested and refined search strategy. Nine electronic databases and other relevant sources were searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature. Two reviewers screened the abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, extracted data and performed quality assessments. Analysis was based on a thematic analysis. The included papers had to present an actionable theoretical framework/model on evidence and policy interrelationships, such as knowledge translation or evidence-based policy, specifically target the agenda-setting process, focus on mental health, be from LMICs and published in English.Results: From 236 publications included in the full text analysis, no studies fully complied with our inclusion criteria. Widening the focus by leaving out 'agenda-setting', we included ten studies, four of which had unique conceptual frameworks focusing on mental health and LMICs but not agenda-setting. The four analysed frameworks confirmed research gaps from LMICs and mental health, and a lack of focus on agenda-setting. Frameworks and models from other health and policy areas provide interesting conceptual approaches and lessons with regards to agenda-setting.Conclusion: Our systematic review identified frameworks on evidence and policy interrelations that differ in their elements and processes. No framework fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Four actionable frameworks are applicable to mental health and LMICs, but none specifically target agenda-setting. We have identified agenda-setting as a research theory gap in the context of mental health knowledge translation in LMICs. Frameworks from other health/policy areas could offer lessons on agenda-setting and new approaches for creating policy impact for mental health and to tackle the translational gap in LMICs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Anxiety and depression are prevalent among cardiac rehabilitation patients but pharmacological and psychological treatments have limited effectiveness in this group. Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy for cardiac rehabilitation patients with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms.Methods/design: The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy plus usual cardiac rehabilitation to usual cardiac rehabilitation alone. Cardiac rehabilitation patients (target sample n = 332) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited across five UK National Health Service Trusts. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive six weekly sessions of group-based metacognitive therapy delivered by either cardiac rehabilitation professionals or research nurses. The intervention and control groups will both be offered the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme within their Trust. The primary outcome is severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score. Secondary outcomes are severity of anxiety/depression at 12-month follow-up, health-related quality of life, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and strength of metacognitive beliefs at 4- and 12-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will help to develop an account of barriers and enablers to the effectiveness of the intervention.Discussion: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiac rehabilitation patients. The therapy, if effective, offers the potential to improve psychological wellbeing and quality of life in this large group of patients.Trial Registration: UK Clinical Trials Gateway, ISRCTN74643496 , Registered on 8 April 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Following up released prisoners is demanding, particularly for those prisoners with mental health problems, for whom stigma and chaotic lifestyles are problematic. Measurement of mental health outcomes after release is challenging. To evaluate mental healthcare for offender populations, using high-quality randomised controlled trials, evidenced-based methods must be developed to engage them while in custody, to locate and re-interview them after release, and to collect potentially stigmatising mental health outcomes data.Methods: We developed an initial theoretical model and operational procedures for collecting baseline and follow-up data informed by a literature search, focus groups, and case studies. Male prisoners from five prisons in two sites were invited to participate. The inclusion criteria included individuals who were above threshold on nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder scales, or who had reported mental health problems in the past 2 years or had been assessed with a likely personality disorder. Potential participants were interviewed to generate baseline data and were re-contacted before their release. We then contacted them for a follow-up interview, which included repeating the earlier data collection measures 2-8 weeks after release. A qualitative formative process evaluation produced and refined a model procedure for the recruitment and retention of male prison leavers in trials, identified the mechanisms which promoted engagement and retention, and mapped these against a theoretical behaviour change model.Results: We developed a flexible procedure which was successful in recruiting male prison leavers to a pilot trial: 185/243 (76%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 70-81%) of those approached agreed to participate. We also retained 63% (95% CI 54-71%) of those eligible to participate in a follow-up interview 2-8 weeks after release. Mental health outcomes data was collected at both these time points.Conclusions: It is possible to design acceptable procedures to achieve sustained engagement critical for delivering and evaluating interventions in prison and in the community and to collect mental health outcomes data. These procedures may reduce attrition bias in future randomised controlled trials of mental health interventions for prison leavers. This procedure has been replicated and successfully delivered in a subsequent pilot trial and a definitive randomised controlled trial.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Migration has been shown to be associated with negative mental health outcomes. Moreover, migrants tend to underutilise mental health services. The current study aimed to assess the association between predictors, divided into three groups (predisposing, enabling and need), and two outcome variables: (1) past professional mental health help-seeking during the stay in the United Kingdom; (2) intentions of mental health help-seeking from a mental health professional within the next three months.Methods: The study utilised a population-based cross-sectional survey with the final sample of 536 participants. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the association between predictors and the outcomes.Results: We found strong evidence that older age, mental health stigma and living circumstances (predisposing factors), as well as knowledge of the National Health Service, social support, and education (enabling factors) were associated with past and future help-seeking for mental health problems. Finally, mental health status was associated with both past help-seeking and intentions.Conclusion: Due to large numbers of migrants in the UK it is vital to ensure that these populations receive adequate mental health support. Findings of the present study may inform development of policies and interventions better tailored to specific migrant populations.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: We performed a systematic review of the currently available evidence on whether psychological treatments are effective for treating depressed primary care patients in comparison with usual care or placebo, taking the type of therapy and its delivery mode into account.Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing a psychological treatment with a usual care or a placebo control in adult, depressed, primary care patients were identified by searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PsycINFO up to December 2013. At least 2 reviewers extracted information from included studies and assessed the risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using posttreatment depression scores as outcome.Results: A total of 30 studies with 5,159 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control, the effect (standardized mean difference) at completion of treatment was -0.30 (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.13) for face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), -0.14 (-0.40 to 0.12) for face-to-face problem-solving therapy, -0.24 (-0.47 to -0.02) for face-to-face interpersonal psychotherapy, -0.28 (-0.44 to -0.12) for other face-to-face psychological interventions, -0.43 (-0.62 to -0.24) for remote therapist-led CBT, -0.56 (-1.57 to 0.45) for remote therapist-led problem-solving therapy, -0.40 (-0.69 to -0.11) for guided self-help CBT, and -0.27 (-0.44 to -0.10) for no or minimal contact CBT.Conclusions: There is evidence that psychological treatments are effective in depressed primary care patients. For CBT approaches, substantial evidence suggests that interventions that are less resource intensive might have effects similar to more intense treatments.</ab>

        <ab>Since the recent shootings in Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; and Newtown, Connecticut, there has been an ever-increasing state and national debate regarding gun control. All 3 shootings involved an alleged shooter who attended college, and in hindsight, evidence of a mental illness was potentially present in these individuals while in school. What appears to be different about the current round of debate is that both pro-gun control and anti-gun control advocates are focusing on mentally ill individuals, early detection of mental illness during school years, and the interactions of such individuals with physicians and the mental health system as a way to solve gun violence. This raises multiple questions for our profession about the apparent increase in these types of events, dangerousness in mentally ill individuals, when to intervene (voluntary vs involuntary), and what role physicians should play in the debate and ongoing prevention. As is evident from the historic Tarasoff court case, physicians and mental health professionals often have new regulations/duties, changes in the physician-patient relationship, and increased liability resulting from high-profile events such as these. Given that in many ways the prediction of who will actually commit a violent act is difficult to determine with accuracy, physicians need to be cautious with how the current gun debate evolves not only for ourselves (eg, increased liability, becoming de facto agents of the state) but for our patients as well (eg, increased stigma, erosion of civil liberties, and changes in the physician-patient relationship). We provide examples of potential troublesome legislation and suggestions on what can be done to improve safety for our patients and for the public.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Anxiety and depression are common among older people, with up to 20% reporting such symptoms, and the prevalence increases with co-morbid chronic physical health problems. Access to treatment for anxiety and depression in this population is poor due to a combination of factors at the level of patient, practitioner and healthcare system. There is evidence to suggest that older people with anxiety and/or depression may benefit both from one-to-one interventions and group social or educational activities, which reduce loneliness, are participatory and offer some activity. Non-traditional providers (support workers) working within third-sector (voluntary) organisations are a valuable source of expertise within the community but are under-utilised by primary care practitioners. Such a resource could increase access to care, and be less stigmatising and more acceptable for older people.Methods: The study is in three phases and this paper describes the protocol for phase III, which will evaluate the feasibility of recruiting general practices and patients into the study, and determine whether support workers can deliver the intervention to older people with sufficient fidelity and whether this approach is acceptable to patients, general practitioners and the third-sector providers. Phase III of the NOTEPAD study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that is individually randomised. It recruited participants from approximately six general practices in the UK. In total, 100 participants aged 65 years and over who score 10 or more on PHQ9 or GAD7 for anxiety or depression will be recruited and randomised to the intervention or usual general practice care. A mixed methods approach will be used and follow-up will be conducted 12 weeks post-randomisation.Discussion: This study will inform the design and methods of a future full-scale RCT.Trial Registration: ISRCTN, ID: ISRCTN16318986 . Registered 10 November 2016. The ISRCTN registration is in line with the World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set. The present paper represents the original version of the protocol. Any changes to the protocol will be communicated to ISRCTN.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Infant nerve injury causes delayed adolescent neuropathic pain, but whether it also leads to psychiatric illness is unknown. Environmental enrichment (EE) increases social communication and activity. Thus, our goal was to test anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after infant peripheral nerve injury and evaluate the effect of environmental enrichment on these models of affective disorders.Methods: Open field, elevated plus maze, sucrose preference, and pain behaviors (paw withdrawal threshold, spontaneous guarding score, and cold response to acetone) were measured in rats that received infant spared nerve injury (SNI). Enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay of cytokines was performed to evaluate the inflammatory response in the brain. Then, the ability of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of a microglia inhibitor, minocycline (MIN), and EE (a free-running wheel, a staircase, a plastic tunnel, a raised platform, and various colored balls) to reverse the infant SNI effects on behaviors and cytokines was examined.Results: Infant nerve injury resulted in adolescent anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. The medial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral hippocampus were skewed to a pro-inflammatory profile. ICV injection of MIN reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors without affecting pain behaviors. In addition, ICV MIN skewed the brain towards an anti-inflammatory profile. Finally, environmental enrichment improved anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, as well as pain behaviors. EE increased brain IL-10 and decreased IL-1β and TNF-α.Conclusions: Infant nerve injury induces adolescent anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and central nervous inflammation. Environmental enrichment reduces these behaviors by normalizing the inflammation balance in the brain.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Although exercise has been addressed as an adjuvant treatment for anxiety, depression and cancer-related symptoms, limited studies have evaluated the effectiveness of exercise in patients with lung cancer.Methods: We recruited 116 patients from a medical centre in northern Taiwan, and randomly assigned them to either a walking-exercise group (n=58) or a usual-care group (n=58). We conducted a 12-week exercise programme that comprised home-based, moderate-intensity walking for 40 min per day, 3 days per week, and weekly exercise counselling. The outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Taiwanese version of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory.Results: We analysed the effects of the exercise programme on anxiety, depression and cancer-related symptoms by using a generalised estimating equation method. The exercise group patients exhibited significant improvements in their anxiety levels over time (P=0.009 and 0.006 in the third and sixth months, respectively) and depression (P=0.00006 and 0.004 in the third and sixth months, respectively) than did the usual-care group patients.Conclusions: The home-based walking exercise programme is a feasible and effective intervention method for managing anxiety and depression in lung cancer survivors and can be considered as an essential component of lung cancer rehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pill-taking, expectations and therapeutic alliance may account for much of the benefit of medication and placebo treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Aims To examine the effects of medication, placebo and supportive care on treatment outcome, and the relationships of expectations and therapeutic alliance to improvement.Method: A total of 88 participants were randomised to 8 weeks of treatment with supportive care alone or combined with double-blind treatment with placebo or antidepressant medication. Expectations of medication effectiveness, general treatment effectiveness and therapeutic alliance were measured (trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00200902).Results: Medication or placebo plus supportive care were not significantly different but had significantly better outcome than supportive care alone. Therapeutic alliance predicted response to medication and placebo; expectations of medication effectiveness at enrolment predicted only placebo response.Conclusions: Pill treatment yielded better outcome than supportive care alone. Medication expectations uniquely predicted placebo treatment outcome and were formed by time of enrolment, suggesting that they were shaped by prior experiences outside the clinical trial.</ab>

        <ab>After nearly three decades of studies evaluating the legal practice of involuntary outpatient commitment, there is yet little consensus about its effectiveness and only limited implementation. Debate continues over how best to assist adults with serious mental illnesses who are unable or unwilling to participate in prescribed community treatment and as a result experience repeated involuntary hospitalizations or involvement with the criminal justice system. The authors comment on the Oxford Community Treatment Order Evaluation Trial (OCTET), a recently conducted randomized trial of outpatient commitment, and discuss the limitations of the study's design for resolving the persistent question of whether compulsory treatment is more effective than purely voluntary treatment for this difficult-to-reach target population. The authors conclude that the search for a definitive and generalizable randomized trial of outpatient commitment may be a quixotic quest; the field should, rather, welcome the results of well-conducted, large-scale, quasi-experimental and naturalistic studies with rigorous multivariable statistical controls.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Several psychotherapies have been found to be effective in the treatment of depression among adults. However, little is known about whether effectiveness differs by racial-ethnic minority group. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to assess the relative effects of psychotherapy for persons from racial-ethnic minority groups, by examining whether a sample's racial-ethnic minority proportion was a moderator of the effect size of psychotherapy. METHODS Eligible studies were identified with an existing database of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the psychological treatment of depression among adults. The analysis included all studies in which the effect of psychotherapy for adults with a depressive disorder or symptomatology was compared with a control condition in an RCT. Only studies that reported the overall racial-ethnic minority proportion of the sample or the studies reporting specific racial-ethnic backgrounds of participants were included. A total of 56 RCTs reported the proportion of participants from racial-ethnic minority groups (with 77 comparisons between psychotherapy treatment and control groups). RESULTS An overall moderate effect size (g=.50) in favor of psychotherapy was found. No significant moderating effect of race-ethnicity was found in bivariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that psychotherapy is equally effective regardless of care seekers' race-ethnicity. Future research should focus on filling in the gap between effective mental health care and the delivery of these services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine the effects of classification on treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD).Method: This is a narrative review.Results: MDD is a highly heterogeneous category, leading to problems in classification and in specificity of treatment. Current models classify all depressions within a single category. However, the construct of MDD obscures important differences between severe disorders that require pharmacotherapy, and mild-to-moderate disorders that can respond to psychotherapy or remit spontaneously. Patients with mild-to-moderate MDD are being treated with routine or overly aggressive pharmacotherapy.Conclusions: The current classification fails to address the heterogeneity of depression, leading to mistreatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined the costs and impact on receipt of hepatitis and HIV testing and hepatitis immunization services of a public health intervention model that was designed for use by persons with serious mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorders.Methods: Between 2006 and 2008, a random sample of 202 nonelderly, predominantly African-American males with a psychotic or major depressive disorder and a co-occurring substance use disorder was recruited at four community mental health outpatient programs in a large metropolitan area. Participants were randomly assigned at each site to enhanced treatment as usual (N=97), including education about blood-borne diseases and referrals for testing and vaccinations, or to an experimental intervention (N=105) that provided on-site infectious disease education, screening of risk level, pretest counseling, testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C, vaccination for hepatitis A and B, and personalized risk-reduction counseling. The authors compared the two study groups to assess the average costs of improving hepatitis and HIV testing and hepatitis A and B vaccination in this population.Results: The average cost per participant was $423 for the intervention and $24 for the comparison condition (t=52.7, df=201, p&lt;.001). The costs per additional person tested was $706 for hepatitis C, $776 for hepatitis B, and $3,630 for HIV, and the cost per additional person vaccinated for hepatitis was $561.Conclusions: Delivery of hepatitis and HIV public health services to persons with serious mental illness in outpatient mental health settings can be as cost-effective as similar interventions for other at-risk populations.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Indigenous peoples globally experience a disproportionate burden of mental illness due to forced policies and practices of colonization and cultural disruption. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline profile of hospitalization rates for mental health-related Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions among First-Nations living both on and off reserve in British Columbia, Canada, and explore the relationship between local access to health services and mental health-related hospitalization rates. Methods: A population-based time trend analysis of mental health-related Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions hospitalizations was conducted using de-identified administrative health data. The study population included all residents eligible under the universal British Columbia Medical Services Plan and living on and off First Nations reserves between 1994/95 and 2009/10. The definition of mental health-related Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions included mood disorders and schizophrenia, and three different change measures were used to operationalize avoidable hospitalizations: 1) rates of episodes of hospital care, 2) rates of length of stay, and 3) readmission rates. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations approach, controlling for age, sex, and socio-economic status, to account for change over time. Results: Our findings show that First Nations living on reserve have higher hospitalization rates for mental disorders compared to other British Columbia residents up until 2008. Those living off reserve had significantly higher hospitalization rates throughout the study period. On-reserve communities served by nursing stations had the lowest rates of hospitalization whereas communities with limited local services had the highest rates. Compared to other British Columbia residents, all First Nations have a shorter length of stay and lower readmission rates. Conclusions: This study suggests that despite reduced rates of hospitalization for mental-health related Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions over time for First Nations, gaps in mental health care still exist. We argue greater investments in primary mental health care are needed to support First Nations health. However, these efforts should place equal importance on prevention and the social determinants of health.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE The authors assessed a state's net costs for assisted outpatient treatment, a controversial court-ordered program of community-based mental health services designed to improve outcomes for persons with serious mental illness and a history of repeated hospitalizations attributable to nonadherence with outpatient treatment. METHOD A comprehensive cost analysis was conducted using 36 months of observational data for 634 assisted outpatient treatment participants and 255 voluntary recipients of intensive community-based treatment in New York City and in five counties elsewhere in New York State. Administrative, budgetary, and service claims data were used to calculate and summarize costs for program administration, legal and court services, mental health and other medical treatment, and criminal justice involvement. Adjusted effects of assisted outpatient treatment and voluntary intensive services on total service costs were examined using multivariate time-series regression analysis. RESULTS In the New York City sample, net costs declined 43% in the first year after assisted outpatient treatment began and an additional 13% in the second year. In the five-county sample, costs declined 49% in the first year and an additional 27% in the second year. Psychotropic drug costs increased during the first year after initiation of assisted outpatient treatment, by 40% and 44% in the city and five-county samples, respectively. Regression analyses revealed significant declines in costs associated with both assisted outpatient treatment and voluntary participation in intensive services, although the cost declines associated with assisted outpatient treatment were about twice as large as those seen for voluntary services. CONCLUSIONS Assisted outpatient treatment requires a substantial investment of state resources but can reduce overall service costs for persons with serious mental illness. For those who do not qualify for assisted outpatient treatment, voluntary participation in intensive community-based services may also reduce overall service costs over time, depending on characteristics of the target population and local service system.</ab>

        <ab>Despite evidence for their comparable efficacy, psychotherapy faces a dramatic decline relative to pharmacotherapy in psychiatry. A deep ideological reason for this decline centres on the belief that psychotherapy is a psychosocial treatment whereas pharmacotherapy is a biological treatment. Modern cognitive neuroscience demonstrates that this distinction is a myth.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE This study explored the range of interventions and the use of more intrusive techniques by staff of assertive community treatment (ACT) teams to promote engagement, manage problem behaviors, and reinforce positive behaviors among patients. Individual and organizational characteristics that may be associated with these practices were identified. METHODS Between January and March 2006, clinicians (N=239) from 34 ACT teams participated in a one-time survey about their intervention strategies with patients, perceptions about the ACT team environment, and beliefs about persons with severe mental illness. RESULTS Significant variation existed in the types of interventions employed across teams. The less intrusive strategies, including positive inducements and verbal guidance, were the most common. Other strategies that placed limits on patients but that were still considered less intrusive-such as medication monitoring and money management-were also common. Clinicians who reported working in more demoralized climates and having negative perceptions of mental illness were more likely to endorse leveraged or intrusive interventions. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest significant variation across teams in the use of intervention strategies. Both perceptions of a demoralized organizational climate and stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness were correlated with the use of more intrusive intervention strategies. Future research on the role and appropriateness of more intrusive interventions in mental health treatment and the impact of such interventions on patient outcomes is warranted.</ab>

        <ab>In this editorial, we discuss Morina and colleagues' meta-analysis of psychological therapies for youth with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression following conflict. Recent years have seen significantly more randomised controlled trial evidence addressing the needs of this population. More work is needed to understand post-traumatic depression, dissemination, timing of intervention and whether trauma-focused interventions are essential.</ab>

        <ab>Background: evidence on the long-term natural history, predictors and outcomes of anxiety after stroke is insufficient to inform effective interventions. This study estimates within 10 years of stroke: (i) the incidence, cumulative incidence, prevalence, and time of onset of anxiety. (ii) Predictors of anxiety and its association with depression. (iii) The association between anxiety 3 months after stroke and mortality, stroke recurrence, disability, cognitive impairment and quality of life (QoL) at follow-up.Methods: data from the South London Stroke Register (1995–2010). Patients were assessed at the time of the stroke, at 3 months, 1 year and then annually for up to 10 years. Baseline data included socio-demographics and stroke severity. Follow-up data included assessments for anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale), disability, cognition and QoL. Multivariate regression was used to investigate predictors and associated outcomes of anxiety.Results: incidence of anxiety up to 10 years ranged from 17 to 24%. Cumulative incidence: 57%. Prevalence range: 32–38%. Amongst patients with anxiety, 58% were anxious at 3 months. 57–73% of patients with anxiety had co-morbid depression. Predictors of anxiety included age under 65, female gender, inability to work, depression treatment, smoking and stroke severity. Anxiety at 3 months was associated with lower QoL at follow-up.Conclusions: anxiety is a frequent problem affecting stroke survivors in the long term. Clinicians should pay attention to patients at risk of anxiety since it is associated with lower QoL and depression.</ab>

        <ab>This column describes the planning and implementation of an integrated behavioral health project which was facilitated and endorsed by a developing accountable health community, the Washtenaw Health Initiative (WHI). The WHI is a voluntary countywide coalition of academic, community, health system, and county government agencies dedicated to improving access to high-quality health care for low-income, uninsured, and Medicaid populations. When lack of access to mental health services was identified as a pressing concern, the WHI endorsed pilot testing of collaborative care, an evidence-based treatment model, in county safety-net clinics. Challenges, outcomes, and relevance of this initiative to other counties or regional entities are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The aim of this study was to examine whether work capabilities differ between workers with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and workers from the general population. The second aim was to investigate whether the capability set was related to work and health outcomes.Methods: A total of 163 workers with MS from the MS@Work study and 163 workers from the general population were matched for gender, age, educational level and working hours. All participants completed online questionnaires on demographics, health and work functioning. The Capability Set for Work Questionnaire was used to explore whether a set of seven work values is considered valuable (A), is enabled in the work context (B), and can be achieved by the individual (C). When all three criteria are met a work value can be considered part of the individual's 'capability set'.Results: Group differences and relationships with work and health outcomes were examined. Despite lower physical work functioning (U = 4250, p = 0.001), lower work ability (U = 10591, p = 0.006) and worse self-reported health (U = 9091, p ≤ 0.001) workers with MS had a larger capability set (U = 9649, p ≤ 0.001) than the general population. In workers with MS, a larger capability set was associated with better flexible work functioning (r = 0.30), work ability (r = 0.25), self-rated health (r = 0.25); and with less absenteeism (r = - 0.26), presenteeism (r = - 0.31), cognitive/neuropsychiatric impairment (r = - 0.35), depression (r = - 0.43), anxiety (r = - 0.31) and fatigue (r = - 0.34).Conclusions: Workers with MS have a larger capability set than workers from the general population. In workers with MS a larger capability set was associated with better work and health outcomes.Trial Registration: This observational study is registered under NL43098.008.12: 'Voorspellers van arbeidsparticipatie bij mensen met relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerose'. The study is registered at the Dutch CCMO register ( https://www.toetsingonline.nl ). This study is approved by the METC Brabant, 12 February 2014. First participants are enrolled 1st of March 2014.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Research suggests that defense mechanisms may underlie other aspects of functioning and psychiatric symptoms. The authors examined whether defenses change in accordance with the hierarchy of defense adaptation during long-term dynamic psychotherapy and whether such change is associated with long-term outcomes on other measures. METHOD Twenty-one adults with depressive, anxiety, and/or personality disorders entered long-term dynamic psychotherapy (mean=248 weeks) and subsequent follow-along (mean duration, 5.1 years). Measures of functioning and symptoms were gathered in periodic follow-along interviews, external to the therapy. A median of eight psychotherapy sessions over 2.5 years for each participant were rated using the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales quantitative method. RESULTS Overall, the lowest (action) and highest (high adaptive) defense levels in the hierarchy of defenses improved significantly, as did overall defensive functioning (median effect size=0.71, 95% CI=0.01-1.83). Overall defensive functioning still remained below the healthy-neurotic range. A higher number of axis I disorders and childhood histories of sexual abuse and witnessing violence were associated with a slower rate of improvement in defenses. Change in defenses within therapy by 2.5 years was highly associated with significant levels of change at 5 years in external measures of both functioning (rs=0.60) and symptoms (rs=0.58), controlling for initial levels. CONCLUSIONS Change in defensive functioning in long-term psychotherapy largely follows the hierarchy of defense adaptation. The relationship to long-term improvement in outcomes suggests that defenses be considered candidates for mediating improvement in functioning and symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>Background Psychological therapies are increasingly delivered in community care settings. In existing literature, patient, disorder and service variables are known to have a significant impact on the recovery outcomes for patients undergoing psychological treatment in secondary care. The aim of this review is to establish which predictors have a significant impact on recovery from common mental health disorders in community settings. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines to identify variables with a predictive power on psychological therapy outcomes. We searched databases using key words and MeSH terms and a strict scoring system and bias check were used. Results A total of 486 unique references were identified from the search. Overall, 19 papers met the inclusion criteria. These reported on a total of 34 778 patients from five countries in various community care settings. Predictive factors identified and found to be significant were initial severity and comorbid depression (11/19 studies), which negatively impacted outcome in all studies. Conclusions We identified key predictors for recovery in a community settings from five countries. The evidence currently available for this setting is limited, so this review serves as a starting point to highlight key factors that warrant further investigation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Emotional disorders, which include both anxiety and depressive disorders, are the most prevalent psychological disorders according to recent epidemiological studies. Consequently, public costs associated with their treatment have become a matter of concern for public health systems, which face long waiting lists. Because of their high prevalence in the population, finding an effective treatment for emotional disorders has become a key goal of today's clinical psychology. The Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders might serve the aforementioned purpose, as it can be applied to a variety of disorders simultaneously and it can be easily performed in a group format.Methods: The study is a multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority controlled clinical trial. Participants will be 220 individuals with emotional disorders, who are randomized to either a treatment as usual (individual cognitive behavioral therapy) or to a Unified Protocol condition in group format. Depression, anxiety, and diagnostic criteria are the primary outcome measures. Secondary measures include the assessment of positive and negative affect, anxiety control, personality traits, overall adjustment, and quality of life. An analysis of treatment satisfaction is also conducted. Assessment points include baseline, post-treatment, and three follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months. To control for missing data and possible biases, intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed.Discussion: This is the first randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic intervention in a group format for the treatment of emotional disorders in public settings in Spain. Results obtained from this study may have important clinical, social, and economic implications for public mental health settings in Spain.Trial Registration: Retrospectively registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Trial NCT03064477 (March 10, 2017). The trial is active and recruitment is ongoing. Recruitment is expected to finish by January 2020.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether employing mental health consumers as consumer-providers in assertive community treatment teams can enhance outcomes for clients with severe mental illness. METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study, presence of consumer-providers and outcomes of 530 clients with severe mental illness in 20 outpatient teams were assessed at baseline and at one-year and two-year follow-ups. Measures included the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS), the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Assessment Schedule (CANSAS), the Working Alliance Scale, the number of hospital days, and the number of days of homelessness. Multilevel regression was used with the independent variables consumer-provider presence, time of measurement, and their interaction. RESULTS: A positive association was found between consumer-provider presence and improvements in functioning on the HoNOS (p=.020), met needs in relation to personal recovery (p=.044), unmet needs in relation to personal recovery (p=.008), and number of homeless days (p.001). A negative association was found for consumer-provider presence and the number of hospital days (p=.019). CONCLUSIONS: Consumer-providers are important participants in outpatient teams serving clients with severe mental illnesses, although integrating these providers as part of a team is a slow process.

        <ab>Background: Telephone-based smoking cessation services ('quitlines') are both effective and cost-effective. Knowledge of modifiable baseline factors in real-life settings with heterogeneous participants is essential for the development and improvement of treatment protocols to assist in telephone-based smoking cessation. The aim was to assess if self-perceived abilities to cope measured at baseline, would predict abstinence at the 12-month follow-up at the Swedish National Tobacco Quitline (SNTQ).Methods: The data were retrieved from a previous randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of proactive and reactive service at the SNTQ. Included were 612 clients calling the SNTQ between February 2009 and September 2010. Outcome measures were self-reported point prevalence and 6-month continuous abstinence at the 12-month follow-up. Plausible predictors of smoking cessation were assessed at the first call and in a baseline questionnaire. Self-perceived abilities at baseline were measured by two questions: (1) How likely is it that you will be smoke-free in one year? and (2) How likely are you to be able to handle stress and depressive mood without smoking? The associations between potential predictors and outcome (smoke-free at 12-month follow-up) were assessed by logistic regression analysis.Results: Of the two potential predictors for abstinence at 12-month follow-up, only the perceived ability to handle stress and depressive mood without smoking remained significant in the adjusted analyses (Odds Ratio, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.27 for point prevalence and OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33 for 6-month continuous abstinence according to intention-to-treat). The overall strongest predictor in the adjusted analyses was smoking status in the week before baseline (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.79-6.09 for point prevalence and OR 3.97, 95% CI 2.01-7.83 for 6-month continuous abstinence).Conclusions: The perceived ability to handle stress and depressive mood without smoking at baseline predicted the subjects' abstinence at the 12-month follow-up. An assessment of/adjustment for stress and depressive mood coping skills may be appropriate in future smoking cessation treatment and research. The treatment protocol can be tailored to individual differences and needs for optimal support.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02085616 .

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Leverage an experimental study to determine whether gender or recent crime victimization modify the mental health effects of moving to low-poverty neighborhoods. METHODS: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study randomized low- income families in public housing to an intervention arm receiving vouchers to subsidize rental housing in lower-poverty neighborhoods or to controls receiving no voucher. We examined 3 outcomes 4 to 7 years after randomization, among youth aged 5 to 16 years at baseline (n = 2829): lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), psychological distress (K6), and Behavior Problems Index (BPI). Treatment effect modification by gender and family's baseline report of recent violent crime victimization was tested via interactions in covariate-adjusted intent-to-treat and instrumental variable adherence- adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Gender and crime victimization significantly modified treatment effects on distress and BPI (P &lt; .10). Female adolescents in families without crime victimization benefited from MTO treatment, for all outcomes (Distress B = -0.19, P= .008; BPI B = -0.13, P= .06; MDD B = -0.036, P= .03). Male adolescents in intervention families experiencing crime victimization had worse distress (B = 0.24, P = .004), more behavior problems (B = 0.30, P &lt; .001), and nonsignificantly higher MDD (B = 0.022, P= .16) versus controls. Other subgroups experienced no effect of MTO treatment. Instrumental variable estimates were similar but larger. CONCLUSIONS: Girls from families experiencing recent violent crime victimization were significantly less likely to achieve mental health benefits, and boys were harmed, by MTO, suggesting need for cross- sectoral program supports to offset multiple Stressors.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Exercise referral schemes within clinical populations may offer benefits for inactive and sedentary individuals, and improve and aid treatment of specific health disorders. This systematic review aims to provide an overview, and examine the impact, of exercise referral schemes in patients with cardiovascular, mental health, and musculoskeletal disorders. This review focuses on populations within the United Kingdom (UK) only, with an aim to inform national exercise referral policies and guidelines.Method: Data was collected from specific sources using validated methodology through PRISMA. Systematic searches were performed using Locate, PubMed, Scopus and Pro Quest: Public Health databases. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria set for each sub group. This included that all studies aimed to prevent, observe, or decrease ill-health relating to the disorder, participants over the age of sixteen, and health disorders and outcomes were reviewed. All studies were conducted in the UK only.Results: In the 13 articles, a variety of modes and types of exercise were utilised. One-to-one supervised exercise sessions based in a gym environment were most frequently employed. Results showed that longer length schemes (20+ weeks) produced better health outcomes, and had higher adherence to physical activity prescribed, than those of shorter length (8-12 weeks). In patients referred with cardiovascular disorders, cardiovascular-related measures showed significant decreases including blood pressure. Schemes increased physical activity levels over the length of scheme for all disorders.Conclusion: Longer length schemes (20+ weeks) improved adherence to physical activity prescribed over the course of the scheme, and could support longer term exercise adherence upon completion, however additional research on larger samples should examine this further. An implication is that schemes currently recommended in guidelines do not tailor programmes to support long term adherence to exercise, which must be addressed. There is currently a lack of research examining programmes tailored to suit the individual's health conditions thus further research might allow providers to tailor delivery and build upon policy recommendations in the UK.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To introduce stepped care as a method of organizing the delivery of treatments, and to consider the factors necessary for implementation. Method: Stepped care is described within the context of strategies such as collaborative care that aim to increase access to mental health care through the improved coordination of care between primary and specialist mental health services. Results from the implementation of stepped care in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are used to highlight the factors required for introducing stepped care into routine services. Issues to address when implementing high-volume services for common mental health problems are derived from this experience. Results: Stepped care sits within the continuum of organizational systems, from situations where responsibility rests almost entirely with primary care clinicians to systems where all patients are managed by specialists for the entire duration of their treatment. Its core principles of delivering low-burden treatments first, followed by careful patient progress monitoring to step patients up to more intensive treatment, are easy to articulate but lead to considerable implementation diversity when services attempt to work in this manner. Services need to ensure they have specific staff competency training, including skills in delivering evidence-based treatments, access to telephony, and smart patient management informatics systems. Conclusions: Stepped care can provide the delivery system for supported self-management. To be successful, health systems need high levels of clinical outcome data and appropriately trained workers. Further attention is required to ensure equity of access and to reduce patient attrition in these systems.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Our study examines the association between suicidal ideation and and self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in a sample of treatment-seeking Canadian combat and peacekeeping veterans; and identifies potential predictors of suicidal ideation.Methods: Actively serving Canadian Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police members and veterans seeking treatment at the Parkwood Hospital Operational Stress Injury Clinic (n = 250) completed measures including the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, and the PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M) between January 2002 and December 2010. Regression analyses were used to determine the respective impact of PTSD, and self-reported symptoms of MDD, GAD, AUD, and anxiety on suicidal ideation.Results: Most people met PCL-M screening criteria for PTSD (73.6%, n = 184), while 70.8% (n = 177) screened positively for a probable major depressive episode. PTSD symptom was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (β = 0.412, P &lt; 0.001). After controlling for self-reported depressive symptom severity, AUD severity, and generalized anxiety, PTSD severity was no longer significantly associated with suicidal ideation (β = 0.043, P = 0.58).Conclusions: Although PTSD alone is associated with suicidal ideation, after controlling for common comorbid psychiatric illnesses, self-reported depressive symptom severity emerged as the most significant predictor of suicidal ideation. These findings support the importance of screening for comorbidities, particularly an MDD, as potentially modifiable conditions that are strongly related to suicidal ideation in military personnel's endorsing criteria for PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In 2013 vocational rehabilitation programmes (VRP) were given official and legal approval under Danish law to assist occupationally marginalized citizens in gaining general life skills, building their work ability, and increasing their chances of entering the work force. The project's aim is to develop a detailed understanding of the health, psychosocial and work circumstances of participating citizens, and of the important processes and mechanisms underlying the potential effects of participating in the VRP.Methods: This study uses an exploratory mixed methods approach with sequential use of quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants are citizens assigned to an individually tailored VRP in the municipality of Sonderborg, Denmark. The quantitative part of the study consists of a longitudinal survey in which participants complete questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up one year later. Variables include demographic and personal characteristics, the latter ascertained through validated questionnaires on well-being, physical activity, interpersonal problems, general health, work ability, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, depression and anxiety. The qualitative part of the study consists of semi-structured interviews and observations that explore experiences related to VRP. Participants will be recruited and data collected from questionnaires, interviews and observations in the period February 2016 - March 2018.Discussion: This research will assemble a unique corpus of knowledge about the characteristics, experiences and outcomes of occupationally marginalized citizens participating in a VRP. It will identify potential enablers and barriers to a successful outcome, and ultimately this knowledge will help inform the future design of individually tailored VRP's.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02641704 , date of registration December 29, 2015.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Nepal's demography is aging rapidly, yet few studies to date have examined how this has affected the health and well-being of the elderly, defined as those above 60 years in Nepal's Senior Citizen Act (2006). Our study, abbreviated NepEldQOLII, aims to assess perceived life satisfaction, and evaluate its relationship with nutritional health and mental well-being among the burgeoning Nepalese elderly population.Methods: A cross-sectional survey among 289 Nepalese elderly, aged ≥60 years, attending an outpatient clinic of a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal was conducted. Nutritional status, depression, and life satisfaction were assessed by a mini-nutritional assessment scale (range: 0-14), a geriatric depression scale (range: 0-15), and a satisfaction with life scale (range: 5-35), respectively. Mediation analyses, adjusted for age, sex, marital status, and family type, were used to assess mediating relationships between nutritional and mental wellbeing with life satisfaction as the outcome.Results: Approximately 21% of the participants were dissatisfied with their life. Life satisfaction was positively associated with being married, high family income, involvement in active earning, and a high nutritional score. Conversely, life satisfaction was inversely associated with living in a nuclear (as opposed to joint) family, the perception of having worse health than peers, the perception of being ignored/hated due to old age, and a higher depression score. In mediation analyses, both nutrition (β = 0.48, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) 95% CI: 0.27, 0.69) and depression (β = - 0.87, BCa 95% CI: -1.01, - 0.74) had significant direct associations with life satisfaction. Furthermore, both nutrition (β = 0.30, BCa 95% CI: 0.13, 0.49) and depression (β = - 0.07, BCa 95% CI: -0.14, - 0.03) mediate each other's association with life satisfaction. Nutritional score mediated 7% of the total association between depression and life satisfaction; depression mediated 38% of the total association between nutrition and life satisfaction.Conclusions: Life satisfaction shows a pattern of decline as nutritional and mental health status decrease. Both depression and under-nutrition had a significant association with life satisfaction. The pathway by which nutrition affects life satisfaction is influenced by depression as a mediator. Moreover, nutritional status explained a small portion of the relationship between depression and life satisfaction. These observed preliminary findings should be confirmed in future longitudinal studies.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE The objective was to identify trajectories of recovery from serious mental illnesses. METHODS A total of 177 members (92 women; 85 men) of a not-for-profit integrated health plan participated in a two-year mixed-methods study of recovery (STARS, the Study of Transitions and Recovery Strategies). Diagnoses included schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and affective psychosis. Data sources included self-reported standardized measures, interviewer ratings, qualitative interviews, and health plan data. Recovery was conceptualized as a latent construct, and factor analyses and factor scores were used to calculate recovery trajectories. Individuals with similar trajectories were identified through cluster analyses. RESULTS Four trajectories were identified-two stable (high and low levels of recovery) and two fluctuating (higher and lower). Few demographic or diagnostic factors differentiated clusters at baseline. Discriminant analyses for trajectories found differences in psychiatric symptoms, physical health, satisfaction with mental health clinicians, resources and strains, satisfaction with medications, and mental health service use. Those with higher scores on recovery factors had fewer psychiatric symptoms, better physical health, greater satisfaction with mental health clinicians, fewer strains and greater resources, less service use, better quality of care, and greater satisfaction with medication. Consistent predictors of trajectories included psychiatric symptoms, physical health, resources and strains, and use of psychiatric medications. CONCLUSIONS Having access to good-quality mental health care-defined as including satisfying relationships with clinicians, responsiveness to needs, satisfaction with psychiatric medications, receipt of services at needed levels, support in managing deficits in resources and strains, and care for general medical conditions-may facilitate recovery. Providing such care may improve recovery trajectories.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is expensive to treat, but providing ineffective treatment is more expensive. Such is the case for many patients who do not respond to antidepressant medication.Aims: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) plus usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression compared with usual care alone.Method: Economic evaluation at 12 months alongside a randomised controlled trial. Cost-effectiveness assessed using a cost-consequences framework comparing cost to the health and social care provider, patients and society, with a range of outcomes. Cost-utility analysis comparing health and social care costs with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).Results: The mean cost of CBT per participant was £910. The difference in QALY gain between the groups was 0.057, equivalent to 21 days a year of good health. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £14 911 (representing a 74% probability of the intervention being cost-effective at the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20 000 per QALY). Loss of earnings and productivity costs were substantial but there was no evidence of a difference between intervention and control groups.Conclusions: The addition of CBT to usual care is cost-effective in patients who have not responded to antidepressants. Primary care physicians should therefore be encouraged to refer such individuals for CBT.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE This article describes the characteristics and early implementation experiences of community behavioral health agencies that received Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to integrate primary care into programs for adults with serious mental illness. METHODS Data were collected from 56 programs, across 26 states, that received PBHCI grants in 2009 (N=13) or 2010 (N=43). The authors systematically extracted quantitative and qualitative information about program characteristics from grantee proposals and semistructured telephone interviews with core program staff. Quarterly reports submitted by grantees were coded to identify barriers to implementing integrated care. RESULTS Grantees shared core features required by the grant but varied widely in terms of characteristics of the organization, such as size and location, and in the way services were integrated, such as through partnerships with a primary care agency. Barriers to program implementation at start-up included difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified staff and issues related to data collection and use of electronic health records, licensing and approvals, and physical space. By the end of the first year, some problems, such as space issues, were largely resolved, but other issues, including problems with staffing and data collection, remained. New challenges, such as patient recruitment, had emerged. CONCLUSIONS Early implementation experiences of PBHCI grantees may inform other programs that seek to integrate primary care into behavioral health settings as part of new, large-scale government initiatives, such as specialty mental health homes.</ab>

        <ab>People with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, experience premature mortality, often from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Unfortunately, people with serious mental illness typically are not screened or treated for CVD risk factors despite national guideline recommendations. Access to primary preventive care in community mental health settings has the potential to reduce early mortality rates in this population. The authors review best practices for developing an integrated care model for people with serious mental illness by considering economic feasibility and sustainability from the perspective of a community mental health clinic (CMHC). A process-mapping approach was used to gather information on clinic costs (staff roles, responsibilities, time, and salary) of serving 544 patients at one CMHC. The estimated annual cost of the model was measurable and modest, at $74 per person, suggesting that this model may be financially feasible.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE This multicenter study compared the relapse and recurrence outcomes of two active treatments, maintenance cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and manualized psychoeducation, both in addition to treatment as usual, in patients in remission from depression. METHOD This was a multicenter prospective randomized observer-blinded study with two parallel groups. The authors assessed 180 patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes who met remission criteria over a 2-month baseline period and who were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of either maintenance CBT or manualized psychoeducation over 8 months and then followed up for 12 months. The main outcome measure was time to first relapse or recurrence of a major depression, based on DSM-IV criteria, as assessed by blinded observers with the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. RESULTS Cox regression analysis showed that time to relapse or recurrence of major depression did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, but a significant interaction was observed between treatment condition and number of previous episodes (5 or &gt;=5). Within the subsample of patients with five or more previous episodes, maintenance CBT was significantly superior to manualized psychoeducation, whereas for patients with fewer than five previous episodes, no significant treatment differences were observed in time to relapse or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that maintenance CBT has significant effects on the prevention of relapse or recurrence only in patients with a high risk of depression recurrence. For patients with a moderate risk of recurrence, nonspecific effects and structured patient education may be equally effective.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patients with severe mental illness may be subjected to Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) in order to secure that the patients adhere to treatment. Few studies have investigated the use of CTOs within an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) setting, and little is known about how the tension between the patients' autonomy and the clinicians' responsibility to act in the patients' best interest are resolved in practice. The aim of this study was to explore the service providers' experiences with CTOs within an ACT setting.Methods: The study was based on reviews of case files of 15 patients, eight individual qualitative in depth interviews and four focus group interviews with service providers involved in ACT and decisions related to CTOs. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data.Results: The main theme 'responsibility with conflicting priorities' emerged from data analysis (case file reviews, individual interviews and focus group interviews). The balance between coercive approaches and the emphasis on promoting patient autonomy was seen as problematic. The participants saw few alternatives to CTOs as long-term measures to secure ongoing treatment for some of the patients. However, participants perceived the ACT model's comprehensive scope as an opportunity to build rapport with patients and thereby better meet their needs. The team approach, the ACT providers' commitment to establish supportive relationships and the frequent meetings with patients in their home environment were highlighted. The ACT approach gave them insight into patients' everyday lives and, in some cases a greater sense of security when considering whether to take patients off CTOs.Conclusions: Many of the participants viewed CTOs as helpful in securing long-term treatment for patients. CTO decision-making was described as challenging and complex and presented the providers with many dilemmas. The ACT approach was considered as helpful in that it afforded comprehensive, patient-centered support and opportunities to build rapport.</ab>

        <ab>There are increasing concerns globally about the mental health of students. In the UK, the actual incidence of mental disturbance is unknown, although university counselling services report increased referrals. This study assesses the levels of mental illness in undergraduate students to examine whether widening participation in education has resulted in increases as hypothesised by the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists. Patterns of disturbance across years are compared to identify where problems arise. Students (N=1197) completed the General Health Questionnaire-28 either on the first day at university or midway through the academic year for first, second and third year students. Rates of mental illness in students equalled those of the general population but only 5.1% were currently receiving treatment. Second year students reported the most significant increases in psychiatric symptoms. Factors contributing to the problem are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE This study compared rates of arrest and incarceration, psychiatric hospitalization, homelessness, and discharge from assertive community treatment (ACT) programs for forensic and nonforensic clients in New York State and explored associated risk factors. METHODS Data were extracted from the New York State Office of Mental Health's Web-based outcome reporting system. ACT clients admitted between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2007 (N=4,756), were divided into three groups by their forensic status at enrollment: recent (involvement in the past six months), remote (forensic involvement was more than six months prior), and no history. Client characteristics as of ACT enrollment and outcomes at one, two, and three years were compared over time. RESULTS Clients with forensic histories had a significantly higher ongoing risk of arrest or incarceration, and those with recent criminal justice involvement had a higher risk of homelessness and early discharge from ACT. Psychiatric hospitalization rates did not differ significantly across groups. Rates of all adverse outcomes were highest in the first year for all ACT clients, especially for those with a recent forensic history, and rates of psychiatric hospitalization, homelessness, and discharge declined over time for all clients. For all ACT clients, homelessness and problematic substance abuse at enrollment were significant risk factors for arrest or incarceration and for homelessness on three-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Clients with recent forensic histories were vulnerable to an array of adverse outcomes, particularly during their first year of ACT. This finding highlights the need for additional strategies to improve forensic and other outcomes for this high-risk population.</ab>

        <ab>Mental, neurological and substance-use disorders presently represent the greatest global burden of disease. Likewise, depression and other psychopathologies are elevated risk comorbidities of other health hazards, such as obesity. Nutrition has been implicated in behaviour, mood and in the pathology and treatment of mental illness. In this brief editorial, we aim to set the scale of the problem in context and overview advances and recent evidence linking nutrition to psychological outcomes. The purpose of the 2016 Nutrition Society Winter Meeting, ‘Diet, nutrition and mental health and wellbeing’ was to review where the evidence is strong, where there are unmet needs for research and to draw together the communities working in this area to share their findings. The papers presented demonstrated clear advancements that are being made in this field. The meeting illustrated compelling support for nutrition as a modifiable risk factor. The present research in the field and evidence presented at the 2016 Nutrition Society Winter Meeting lead us to postulate that even interventions with relatively modest effect sizes may plausibly and significantly curtail the disease burden of mental and neurological disease by food- and nutrient-based approaches.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Study a quality improvement approach for implementing evidence-based employment services at specialty mental health clinics.Data Sources/study Setting: Semistructured interviews with clinicians and administrators before, during, and after implementation. Qualitative field notes, structured baseline and follow-up interviews with patients, semistructured interviews with patients after implementation, and administrative data.Study Design: Site-level controlled trial at four implementation and four control sites. Hybrid implementation-effectiveness study with mixed methods intervention evaluation design.Data Collection/extraction Methods: Site visits, in-person and telephone interviews, patient surveys, patient self-assessment. A total of 801 patients completed baseline surveys and 53 clinicians and other clinical key stakeholders completed longitudinal qualitative interviews.Principal Findings: At baseline, sites varied in the availability, utilization, and quality of supported employment. Each site needed quality improvement for this service, though for differing reasons, with some needing development of the service itself and others needing increased service capacity. Improvements in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and referral behaviors were evident in mid- and postimplementation interviews, though some barriers persisted. Half of patients expressed an interest in working at baseline. Patients at implementation sites were 2.3 times more likely to receive employment services during the study year. Those who had a service visit were more likely to be employed at follow-up than those who did not.Conclusions: Studies of implementation and effectiveness require mixed methods to both enhance implementation in real time and provide context for interpretation of complex results. In this study, a quality improvement approach resulted in superior patient-level outcomes and improved clinician knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, in the context of substantial variation among sites.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is an urgent need for clinically effective and cost-effective methods to manage antisocial and criminal behaviour in adolescents. Youth conduct disorder is increasingly prevalent in the UK and is associated with a range of negative outcomes. Quantitative systematic reviews carried out for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have identified multisystemic therapy, an intensive, multimodal, home-based, family intervention for youth with serious antisocial behaviour, as one of the most promising interventions for reducing antisocial or offending behaviour and improving individual and family functioning. Previous international trials of multisystemic therapy have yielded mixed outcomes, and it is questionable to what extent positive US findings can be generalised to a wider UK mental health and juvenile justice context. This paper describes the protocol for the Systemic Therapy for At Risk Teens (START) trial, a multicentre UK-wide randomised controlled trial of multisystemic therapy in antisocial adolescents at high risk of out-of-home placement.Methods/design: The trial is being conducted at 10 sites across the UK. Seven hundred participants and their families will be recruited and randomised on a 1:1 basis to multisystemic therapy or management as usual. Treatments are offered over a period of 3 to 5 months, with follow-up to 18 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome is out-of-home placement at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include offending rates, total service and criminal justice sector costs, and participant well-being and educational outcomes. Data will be gathered from police computer records, the National Pupil Database, and interview and self-report measures administered to adolescents, parents and teachers. Outcomes will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, using a logistic regression with random effects for the primary outcome and Cox regressions and linear mixed-effects models for secondary outcomes depending on whether the outcome is time-to-event or continuous.Discussion: The START trial is a pragmatic national trial of sufficient size to evaluate multisystemic therapy, to inform policymakers, service commissioners, professionals, service users and their families about its potential in the UK. It will also provide data on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of usual services provided to youth with serious antisocial behaviour problems.Trial Registration: ISRCTN77132214.</ab>

        <ab>During the past century, the scope of mental health intervention in North America has gradually expanded from an initial focus on hospitalized patients with psychoses to outpatients with neurotic disorders, including the so-called worried well. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition, is further embracing the concept of a mental illness spectrum, such that increasing attention to the softer end of the continuum can be expected in the future. This anticipated shift rekindles important questions about how mental illness is defined, how to distinguish between mental disorders and normal reactions, whether psychiatry is guilty of prevalence inflation, and when somatic therapies should be used to treat problems of living. Such debates are aptly illustrated by the example of complicated bereavement, which is best characterized as a form of adjustment disorder. Achieving an overarching definition of mental illness is challenging, owing to the many different contexts in which DSM diagnoses are used. Careful analyses of such contextual utility must inform future decisions about what ends up in DSM, as well as how mental illness is defined by public health policy and society at large. A viable vision for the future of psychiatry should include a spectrum model of mental health (as opposed to exclusively mental illness) that incorporates graded, evidence-based interventions delivered by a range of providers at each point along its continuum.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: A longitudinal analysis was used to explore the relationship between diagnosis of serious mental illness and subsequent new diagnoses of HIV. METHODS: Logistic regression was used to predict HIV/AIDS diagnoses in 2002-2004 among Medicaid beneficiaries in eight states (N=6,417,676) who were without HIV in 2001. Results for beneficiaries with and without serious mental illness, a substance use disorder, and psychiatric comorbidities in 2001 were compared. RESULTS: After controlling for substance abuse or dependence and other factors, the analyses indicated that the odds of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses among beneficiaries with or without serious mental illness did not differ significantly. Compared with beneficiaries without a substance use disorder or serious mental illness, individuals with a substance use disorder but without serious mental illness were 3.1 times (OR=3.13, p&lt;.001) more likely, and those with both substance abuse or dependence and serious mental illness were 2.1 times (OR=2.09, p&lt;.001) more likely, to receive a new HIV diagnosis in 2002-2004. However, people with serious mental illness but without a substance use disorder in 2001 were 23% less likely (OR=.77, p&lt;.001) than people without serious mental illness or a substance use disorder in 2001 to receive a new HIV diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: After substance abuse or dependence was controlled for longitudinally, little independent association between serious mental illness and the risk of new HIV diagnoses was found. HIV-prevention services for low-income individuals should be delivered to all persons with serious mental illness, but especially those with comorbid substance use disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) comprise half of the total regional population, yet existing mental health services are severely under-equipped to meet their needs. Although effective interventions for the treatment of disruptive behavioral disorders (DBDs) in youth have been tested in high-poverty and high-stress communities in developed countries, and are relevant for widespread dissemination in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), most of these evidence-based practices (EBPs) have not been utilized in SSA, a region heavily impacted by poverty, diseases including HIV/AIDS, and violence. Thus, this paper presents a protocol for a scale-up longitudinal experimental study that uses a mixed-methods, hybrid type II, effectiveness implementation design to test the effectiveness of an EBP, called Multiple Family Group (MFG) aimed at improving child behavioral challenges in Uganda while concurrently examining the multi-level factors that influence uptake, implementation, sustainment, and youth outcomes.Methods: The MFG intervention will be implemented and tested via a longitudinal experimental study conducted across 30 public primary schools located in both semi-urban and rural communities. The schools will be randomly assigned to three study conditions (n = 10 per study condition): (1) MFG delivered by trained family peers; (2) MFG delivered by community health workers; or; (3) comparison: usual care comprising mental health care support materials, bolstered with school support materials. A total of 3000 children (ages 8 to 13 years; grades 2 to 7) and their caregivers (N = 3000 dyads); 60 parent peers, and 60 community health workers will be recruited. Each study condition will comprise of 1000 child-caregiver dyads. Data will be collected at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks, and 6-month follow-up.Discussion: This project is the first to test the effectiveness of the MFG intervention while concurrently examining multi-level factors that influence overall implementation of a family-based intervention provided in schools and aimed at reaching the large child population with mental health service needs in Uganda. Moreover, the study draws upon an EBP that has already been tested for delivery by parent peers and community facilitators, and hence will take advantage of the advancing science behind task-shifting. If successful, the project has great potential to address global child mental health needs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03081195 . Registered on 16 March 2017.</ab>

        <ab>Elevated in vivo markers of presynaptic striatal dopamine activity have been a consistent finding in schizophrenia, and include a large effect size elevation in dopamine synthesis capacity. However, it is not known if the dopaminergic dysfunction is limited to the striatal terminals of dopamine neurons, or is also evident in the dopamine neuron cell bodies, which mostly originate in the substantia nigra. The aim of our studies was therefore to determine whether dopamine synthesis capacity is altered in the substantia nigra of people with schizophrenia, and how this relates to symptoms. In a post-mortem study, a semi-quantitative analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase staining was conducted in nigral dopaminergic cells from post-mortem tissue from patients with schizophrenia (n = 12), major depressive disorder (n = 13) and matched control subjects (n = 13). In an in vivo imaging study, nigral and striatal dopaminergic function was measured in patients with schizophrenia (n = 29) and matched healthy control subjects (n = 29) using (18)F-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine ((18)F-DOPA) positron emission tomography. In the post-mortem study we found that tyrosine hydroxylase staining was significantly increased in nigral dopaminergic neurons in schizophrenia compared with both control subjects (P &lt; 0.001) and major depressive disorder (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in tyrosine hydroxylase staining between control subjects and patients with major depressive disorder, indicating that the elevation in schizophrenia is not a non-specific indicator of psychiatric illness. In the in vivo imaging study we found that (18)F-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine uptake was elevated in both the substantia nigra and in the striatum of patients with schizophrenia (effect sizes = 0.85, P = 0.003 and 1.14, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) and, in the voxel-based analysis, was elevated in the right nigra (P &lt; 0.05 corrected for family wise-error). Furthermore, nigral (18)F-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine uptake was positively related with the severity of symptoms (r = 0.39, P = 0.035) in patients. However, whereas nigral and striatal (18)F-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine uptake were positively related in control subjects (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001), this was not the case in patients (r = 0.30, P = 0.11). These findings indicate that elevated dopamine synthesis capacity is seen in the nigral origin of dopamine neurons as well as their striatal terminals in schizophrenia, and is linked to symptom severity in patients.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Globally, there is a growing interest in understanding and addressing modifiable psychosocial risk factors, particularly depression and anxiety, to prevent CVDs and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Despite the high premature mortality rate from CVDs in Latvia, this is the first Latvian study to examine the association of depression and anxiety with CVD morbidity in a primary care population.Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2015 within the framework of the National Research Program BIOMEDICINE at 24 primary care facilities throughout Latvia. Consecutive adult patients during a one-week time period at each facility were invited to join the study. Assessments onsite included a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) followed by a socio-demographic questionnaire and measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and total cholesterol. The diagnostic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was conducted over the telephone within 2 weeks after the visit to the general practitioner. A multivariate model was developed using binary logistic regression.Results: From the 1565 subjects (31.2% male), CVD was detected in 17.1%. Depression screening was positive (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) for 14.7%, and anxiety screening was positive (GAD-7 ≥ 10) for 10.1% of the study subjects. According to the MINI, 10.3% had current and 28.1% had lifetime depressive episode, and 16.1% had an anxiety disorder. Depression, not anxiety, was statistically significantly related to CVDs with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.52 (p = 0.04) for current depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and 2.08 (p = 0.002) for lifetime depressive episode (MINI).Conclusions: Current depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and a lifetime depressive episode (according to the MINI) were significantly associated with increased risk of CV morbidity. Therefore, CV patients should be screened and treated for depression to potentially improve the prognosis of CVDs. Enhanced training and integration of mental health treatment in Latvian primary care settings may improve clinical outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents author's comments on the psychodynamic psychotherapies used in cognitive-behavioral treatments. It mentions that lack of research into outcomes of psychodynamic therapy, with politicization of psychotherapy guilds led to rise in marginalization and endangerment. It focuses on the equivalence of psychodynamic psychotherapy with other treatments, depicting the public health implication.</ab>

        <ab>For the first time in history, China has a mental health legal framework. People in China can now expect a better life and more accessible, better-quality health care services for their loved ones. Development of a community mental health service (CMHS) is at a crossroads. In this new column on mental health reforms in Asia, the authors review the current state of the CMHS in China and propose four strategic directions for future development: building on the strengths of the '686 Project,' the 2004 initiative that launched China's mental health reform; improving professional skills of the mental health workforce, especially for a recovery approach; empowering families and caregivers to support individuals with severe mental illness; and using information and communications technology to promote self-help and reduce the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study characterized racial-ethnic differences in treatment of veterans with chronic depression by examining antidepressant and psychotherapy use among non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian-Alaska Native (AI/AN) veterans.Methods: Logistic regression models were estimated with data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical records for a sample of 62,095 chronically depressed patients. Data (2009-2010) were from the VA External Peer Review Program. Three primary outcome measures were used: receipt of adequate antidepressant therapy (≥80% medications on hand), receipt of adequate psychotherapy (at least six sessions in six months), and receipt of guideline-concordant treatment (either of these treatments).Results: Compared with whites, nearly all minority groups had lower odds of adequate antidepressant use and guideline-concordant care in unadjusted and adjusted models (antidepressant adjusted odds ratio [AOR] range=.53-.82, p&lt;.05; guideline-concordant AOR range=.59-.83, p&lt;.05). Although receipt of adequate psychotherapy was more common among veterans from minority groups in unadjusted analyses, differences between Hispanic, AI/AN, and white veterans were no longer significant after covariate adjustment. After adjustment for distance to the VA facility, the difference between black and white veterans was no longer significant.Conclusions: A better understanding of how patient preferences and provider and system factors interact to generate differences in depression care is needed to improve care for patients from racial-ethnic minority groups. It will become increasingly important to differentiate between health service use patterns that stem from genuine differences in patient preferences and those that signify inequitable quality of depression care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Access to outpatient psychiatric care remains problematic in Canada. We have been using group medical visits (GMV) to treat psychiatric outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders. Our study aimed to show that patients are similarly satisfied with GMV and individual psychiatric treatment, hence the concern that patients truly prefer individual treatment may be unfounded.Method: Our study compared patient satisfaction in people who have had previous individual psychiatric care and are now receiving GMV to determine whether there is a treatment preference.Results: Questionnaire data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The ANOVAs showed no differences in patients' experiences with individual treatment, compared with GMV. In addition, we found when asked directly, most patients preferred GMV or had no treatment preference.Conclusions: These findings indicate that patients' perspectives of individual psychiatric treatment and GMV are roughly equal. This suggests that the method of GMV deserves further study and comparison with other clinical models of psychiatric outpatient treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Early identification and management of mental illness in childhood and adolescence helps to avert debilitating mental illness in adulthood but the attention given to Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) has until recently been low. Traditional healers are often consulted by patients with mental illness and in Uganda, up to 60% of patients attending traditional healers have moderate to severe mental illness. Poor access to CAMH care in Uganda creates a treatment gap that could be met through enhanced collaboration between traditional healers and biomedical health systems. The aim of this study was to explore traditional healers' views on their collaboration with biomedical health systems so as to inform the implementation of strategies to improve access to CAMH services in Uganda.Methods: In-depth interviews with 20 purposively selected traditional healers were conducted in November 2015. A semi-structured interview guide was used to explore: 1) The experiences of traditional healers with mental ill-health in children and adolescents; 2) their willingness to collaborate with the formal health system; and 3) their perception of clinicians' willingness to collaborate with them. Interviews were conducted in local languages and tape recorded. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Traditional healers described several experiences managing children and adolescents with mental illness, which they ascribed to spiritual and physical causes. The spiritual explanations were a consequence of unhappy ancestral spirits, modern religions and witchcraft, while physical causes mentioned included substance abuse and fevers. No traditional healer had received a patient referred to them from a medical clinic although all had referred patients to clinics for non-mental health reasons. Traditional healers expressed distrust in biomedical health systems and believed their treatments were superior to medical therapies in alleviating mental suffering. They expressed willingness to collaborate with biomedical providers. However, traditional healers believe clinicians disregard them and would not be willing to collaborate with them.Conclusion: Potential for collaboration between traditional healers and biomedical health systems for improving access to CAMH services in Uganda exists, but is undermined by mutual mistrust and competition between traditional healers and clinicians.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Psychological health is related to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and is an essential component of self-efficacy and enjoying a healthy lifestyle. Need assessment and plans to improve the psychological health of these women provides significantly valuable information to design an advantageous intervention program to reach that goal. Therefore, this study will conduct to improve the psychological health for women with PCOS through a designed comprehensive care. Methods: This is an exploratory mixed method study using consecutive qualitative-quantitative methods, including three consecutive phases. In the first phase, a qualitative study will be conducted to assess their needs and will design a care protocol for improving mental health of women with PCOS. Participants in this phase will select by purposive sampling method and data will collect using semi-structured interviews by taking notes at same time. Data will analyze using conventional content analysis method. At second phase, according the information obtained from previous phase and a literature review a comprehensive program to mental health care will be proposed. Then multidisciplinary team will review and finalize it according to priorities. The third phase will follow a quantitative approach using quasi-experimental study with two groups to measure the effectiveness of this program on the women’s psychological health. Discussion: Designing a program based on a qualitative study and a review article and updated evidences can lead to improving of these women’s psychological health and quality of life. Consequently, we expect to show that mental health program provided by a multidisciplinary team improves reproductive outcomes while at the same time being cost-effective in women with PCOS.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The Monthly Treatment and Progress Summary (MTPS) was developed to assess treatment techniques applied in clinical practice. This study examined the factor structure of the reported therapeutic practice elements on the MTPS and explored patterns in technique use based on client and therapist characteristics in a community mental health setting. METHODS: MTPS data from 278 lead therapists in Hawai'i's local system of care were extracted from the online state mental health information management system. Therapists' endorsements (yes-no) of each practice element were examined across 278 completed youth treatment episodes, and an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the categorical data set. RESULTS: Three factors emerged from the analyses: behavior management (behavioral interventions), coping and self-control (self-change practices), and family interventions (family supports). Treatment teams with licensed therapists reported higher use of coping and self-control practice elements, whereas teams with unlicensed therapists and paraprofessionals reported greater use of behavior management practice elements. Lead therapists reported that teams treating younger clients and those with attentional disorders were more likely to use behavior management practice elements, and teams treating youths with more severe impairment at intake utilized more behavior management and family intervention practice elements. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the MTPS shows promise as a therapist report of practices. The finding that practice elements organized into theoretical patterns and were applied in expected ways suggests a thoughtful approach to usual care techniques. With the increased focus on health care reform and managed care, the MTPS can inform system monitoring, feedback, and improvement.

        <ab>Adolescent parenthood is associated with a range of adverse outcomes for young mothers, including mental health problems such as depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Teen mothers are also more likely to be impoverished and reside in communities and families that are socially and economically disadvantaged. These circumstances can adversely affect maternal mental health, parenting, and behavior outcomes for their children. In this report, we provide an overview of the mental health challenges associated with teen parenthood, barriers that often prevent teen mothers from seeking mental health services, and interventions for this vulnerable population that can be integrated into primary care services. Pediatricians in the primary care setting are in a unique position to address the mental health needs of adolescent parents because teens often turn to them first for assistance with emotional and behavioral concerns. Consequently, pediatricians can play a pivotal role in facilitating and encouraging teen parents' engagement in mental health treatment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE People with psychiatric impairments (primarily schizophrenia or a mood disorder) are the largest and fastest-growing group of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries. The authors investigated whether evidence-based supported employment and mental health treatments can improve vocational and mental health recovery for this population. METHOD Using a randomized controlled trial design, the authors tested a multifaceted intervention: team-based supported employment, systematic medication management, and other behavioral health services, along with elimination of barriers by providing complete health insurance coverage (with no out-of-pocket expenses) and suspending disability reviews. The control group received usual services. Paid employment was the primary outcome measure, and overall mental health and quality of life were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Overall, 2,059 SSDI beneficiaries with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression in 23 cities participated in the 2-year intervention. The teams implemented the intervention package with acceptable fidelity. The intervention group experienced more paid employment (60.3% compared with 40.2%) and reported better mental health and quality of life than the control group. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of the complex intervention in routine mental health treatment settings was feasible, and the intervention was effective in assisting individuals disabled by schizophrenia or depression to return to work and improve their mental health and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>Background: A self-reported life satisfaction question is routinely used as an indicator of societal well-being. Several studies support that mental illness is an important determinant for life satisfaction and improvement of mental healthcare access therefore could have beneficial effects on a population's life satisfaction. However, only a few studies report the relationship between subjective mental health and life satisfaction. Subjective mental health is a broader concept than the presence or absence of psychopathology. In this study, we examine the strength of the association between a self-reported mental health question and self-reported life satisfaction, taking into account other relevant factors.Methods: We conducted this analysis using successive waves of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) collected between 2003 and 2012. Respondents included more than 400,000 participants aged 12 and over. We extracted information on self-reported mental health, socio-demographic and other factors and examined correlation with self-reported life satisfaction using a proportional ordered logistic regression.Results: Life satisfaction was strongly associated with self-reported mental health, even after simultaneously considering factors such as income, general health, and gender. The poor-self-reported mental health group had a particularly low life satisfaction. In the fair-self-reported mental health category, the odds of having a higher life satisfaction were 2.35 (95% CI 2.21 to 2.50) times higher than the odds in the poor category. In contrast, for the "between 60,000 CAD and 79,999 CAD" household income category, the odds of having a higher life satisfaction were only 1.96 (95% CI 1.90 to 2.01) times higher than the odds in the "less than 19,999 CAD" category.Conclusions: Subjective mental health contributes highly to life satisfaction, being more strongly associated than other selected previously known factors. Future studies could be useful to deepen our understanding of the interplay between subjective mental health, mental illness and life satisfaction. This may be beneficial for developing public health policies that optimize mental health promotion, illness prevention and treatment of mental disorders to enhance life satisfaction in the general population.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine the impact of anxiety disorders comorbid to bipolar disorder (BD) in a large, nationally representative sample, to describe the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of Canadians living with BD and with or without comorbid anxiety disorders, to identify the characteristics uniquely associated with comorbid anxiety, and to examine treatment patterns.Method: We analyzed data from the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being, conducted among 38 492 Canadians. People meeting the criteria for BD (n = 808) were compared based on the presence or absence of an assessed anxiety disorder (that is, social phobia, panic disorder, and agoraphobia).Results: People with BD and a comorbid anxiety disorder fare worse in terms of BD relapses, suicidality, and sleep disturbance, and are more likely to be taking psychiatric medication. They have more impairment in their work and social functioning and rate their health and life satisfaction lower. Despite the greater severity, they are not receiving additional psychological treatment, they feel they are not receiving the treatment they need, and they report more barriers to treatment.Conclusions: This study confirms the critical impact of comorbid anxiety on the course of BD in a large, nationally representative sample and reveals that the psychological treatment needs of this population are not being met. Clinical and research implications are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Recommendations for treatment of chronic major depressive disorder (cMDD) are mostly based on clinical experiences and on the literature on treatment-resistant depression (TRD) but not on a systematic review of the literature.Method: We conducted a systematic review of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with 17 comparisons between antidepressants (ADs), psychotherapy, or the combination of both interventions.Results: The best evidence is for the combination of psychotherapy and ADs, and especially for the combination of the cognitive behavourial analysis system of psychotherapy and ADs. Evidence is very weak for both ADs alone and psychotherapy alone. Assessment of TRD was mostly absent in the studies.Conclusion: The best treatment for cMDD is a combination of psychotherapy and ADs. However, there is a lack of well-performed RCTs in both ADs and psychotherapy and their combination for cMDD. Therefore, the conclusions are preliminary.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: No recent meta-analysis has examined the effects of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for adult depression. We decided to conduct such an updated meta-analysis.Methods: Studies were identified through systematic searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane library). We included studies examining the effects of CBT, compared with control groups, other psychotherapies, and pharmacotherapy.Results: A total of 115 studies met inclusion criteria. The mean effect size (ES) of 94 comparisons from 75 studies of CBT and control groups was Hedges g = 0.71 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.79), which corresponds with a number needed to treat of 2.6. However, this may be an overestimation of the true ES as we found strong indications for publication bias (ES after adjustment for bias was g = 0.53), and because the ES of higher-quality studies was significantly lower (g = 0.53) than for lower-quality studies (g = 0.90). The difference between high- and low-quality studies remained significant after adjustment for other study characteristics in a multivariate meta-regression analysis. We did not find any indication that CBT was more or less effective than other psychotherapies or pharmacotherapy. Combined treatment was significantly more effective than pharmacotherapy alone (g = 0.49).Conclusions: There is no doubt that CBT is an effective treatment for adult depression, although the effects may have been overestimated until now. CBT is also the most studied psychotherapy for depression, and thus has the greatest weight of evidence. However, other treatments approach its overall efficacy.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study examined factors associated with the utilization of psychotherapy offered in primary care via videoconferencing (telepsychotherapy).Methods: Primary care patients with depression (N=179) recruited from five Federally Qualified Health Centers were randomly assigned to telemedicine-based collaborative care and offered free telepsychotherapy. Independent variables included measures of access to and need for treatment. Logistic regression identified variables associated with acceptability of and initiation and engagement in telepsychotherapy.Results: To 76% of patients the idea of participating in psychotherapy was acceptable. Thirty-eight percent scheduled a telepsychotherapy session, 17% attended a session, and 8% engaged in treatment (attended at least eight sessions). Because the intervention was designed to minimize barriers, access was not a significant predictor of utilization. However, use of telepsychotherapy was associated with measures of perceived need.Conclusions: Even when psychotherapy was delivered in a primary care setting via videoconferencing to minimize barriers, few patients initiated or engaged in telepsychotherapy.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE A previous study of a recovery-oriented assertive community treatment initiative (PACT) in Washington State found reductions in state psychiatric hospital use and related costs for PACT participants, especially in the first six months after enrollment and for consumers who were high users of the state psychiatric hospital before ACT enrollment. This study examined whether these outcomes varied by team fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT practices. METHODS Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the relationship between scores on the Tool for Measurement of Assertive Community Treatment (TMACT), a recently developed tool for assessing fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT, and the use of state hospitals, local hospitals, emergency departments, local crisis stabilization units, and arrests for 631 PACT consumers. These relationships were also examined for PACT consumers with any state hospital use (N=450) and those considered high users of the state hospital (&gt;=96 days in two years before PACT enrollment). RESULTS TMACT scores were associated (p.01) with a decrease in the amount of use but not the probability of using state psychiatric hospitals, local hospital psychiatric inpatient units, and local crisis stabilization units. The marginal effects of higher TMACT scores on the probability and use of emergency departments or arrests were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary evidence for the predictive validity of the TMACT. Future research should examine the subscale structure of the TMACT as well as the association between TMACT fidelity and consumer well-being, quality of life, and other important person-centered outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Background: With increasing emphasis on integrating behavioral health services, primary care providers play an important role in managing patients with suicidal thoughts.Objective: To evaluate whether Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Item 9 scores are associated with patient characteristics, management, and depression outcomes in a primary care-based mental health program.Design: Observational analysis of data collected from a patient registry.Participants: Eleven thousand fifteen adults enrolled in the Mental Health Integration Program (MHIP).Interventions: MHIP provides integrated mental health services for safety-net populations in over 100 community health centers across Washington State. Key elements of the team-based model include: a disease registry; integrated care management; and organized psychiatric case review.Main Measures: The independent variable, suicidal ideation (SI), was assessed by PHQ-9 Item 9. Depression severity was assessed with the PHQ-8. Outcomes included four indicators of depression treatment process (care manager contact, psychiatric case review, psychotropic medications, and specialty mental health referral), and two indicators of depression outcomes (50 % reduction in PHQ-9 score and PHQ-9 score &lt; 10).Key Results: SI was common (45.2 %) at baseline, with significantly higher rates among men and patients with greater psychopathology. Few patients with SI (5.4 %) lacked substantial current depressive symptoms. After adjusting for age, gender, and severity of psychopathology, patients with SI received follow-up earlier (care manager contact HR = 1.05, p &lt; 0.001; psychiatric review HR = 1.02, p &lt; 0.05), and were more likely to receive psychotropic medications (OR = 1.11, p = 0.001) and specialty referral (OR = 1.23, p &lt; 0.001), yet were less likely to achieve a PHQ-9 score &lt; 10 (HR = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001).Conclusions: Suicidal thoughts are common among safety-net patients referred by primary care providers for behavioral health care. Scores on Item 9 of the PHQ-9 are easily obtainable in primary care, may help providers initiate conversations about suicidality, and serve as useful markers of psychiatric complexity and treatment-resistance. Patients with positive scores should receive timely and comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and follow-up.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Monitoring fidelity of assertive community treatment (ACT) teams is costly. This study investigated the reliability and validity of a less burdensome approach: self-reported assessment.Methods: Phone-administered and self-reported assessments were compared for 16 ACT teams. Team leaders completed a self-report protocol providing information sufficient to score the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS). Two raters scored the DACTS using only self-reported information. Two additional raters conducted phone interviews with team leaders, verifying the self-reported data, and independently scored the DACTS.Results: DACTS total scores obtained via self-reported assessments were reliable and valid compared with phone-administered assessment on the basis of interrater consistency (intraclass correlation) and consensus (mean rating differences). Phone-administered assessments agreed with self-reported assessments within .25 scale points (out of 5 points) for 15 of 16 teams.Conclusions: A self-report approach could address concerns regarding costs of monitoring as part of a stepped approach to quality assurance.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Social skills might play an important role for the relationship between maternal psychological distress and subsequent development of depressive symptoms. The majority perspective is that social skills is adaptive and protective, but there is a need to also highlight the potential maladaptive effect of social skills in some settings or for some sub groups. The current study examined the longitudinal interplay between maternal-reported psychological distress in early childhood (age 1.5), and offspring reports on social skills and depressive symptoms in early (age 12.5) and middle adolescence (age 14.5).Methods: We used data from the Tracking Opportunities and Problems Study (TOPP), a community-based longitudinal study following Norwegian families to examine direct links and interactions between early maternal distress (measured with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist) and early adolescent offspring social skills (measured with the Social Skills Rating System) and middle adolescent depressive symptoms (measured with the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire) in 370 families (in total 740 mothers and adolescents).Results: Exposure to childhood maternal distress predicted offspring depressive symptoms in middle adolescence. Higher social skills in early adolescence predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms for girls, but not for boys, in middle adolescence. An interaction effect was found in which adolescents exposed to early maternal distress who reported high social skills in early adolescence had the highest level of depressive symptoms in middle adolescence.Conclusions: The findings highlight the nuances in the role of social skills for adolescent depressive symptoms - having the potential to be both adaptive as well as maladaptive for some subgroups (those experiencing maternal psychological distress). This has important implications for social skill programs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Adequate recruitment and retention rates are vital to achieving a successful randomized controlled trial. Historically this has been particularly challenging in mental health research. Few researchers have explored patients' reasons for taking part and remaining in a depression trial.Objective: To explore patients' reasons for taking part and remaining in a trial that aimed to assess the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an adjunct to usual care for primary care patients with treatment resistant depression.Method: (i)Design: Patients completed a short exit questionnaire about their experiences of taking part in the CoBalT trial. In addition, 40 semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of these patients to further explore their experiences. (ii)Setting: General practices, England and Scotland.Results: Of 469 patients randomized into the trial, 302 (64.4%) completed an exit questionnaire. The most frequently rated reason for taking part in the study were 'I was willing to try anything that might help me feel better' (66%). Patients indicated in interviews why they preferred follow-up data to be collected on a face-to-face basis rather than over the telephone. Some patients reported that taking part in the trial gave them a sense of self-worth and accomplishment.Conclusion: Patients felt they benefited from being in the trial because it enabled them to reflect on their feelings. For some, taking part increased their feelings of self-worth. These findings may be applicable to trials where feelings of inclusion and being valued are likely to promote continued participation.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE A previous study of recovery-oriented assertive community treatment (PACT) found large differences over three years in use of state psychiatric hospitals between PACT participants and consumers in a matched control group, especially for PACT participants with significant previous psychiatric hospitalization. This study extended these findings by examining the timing of PACT effects. METHODS Generalized estimating equation models of monthly cost data for state, local, and crisis hospital use estimated the time-varying effects of participation in one of ten PACT teams in Washington State. Data from PACT participants (N=450) and propensity score-matched consumers (N=450) were included. Additional analyses determined whether effects differed by prior state hospital use. RESULTS Differences in costs between PACT and control participants were largest immediately after PACT enrollment and tapered off. During the first quarter after enrollment, monthly per-person costs for state hospital use were $3,458 lower for PACT enrollees than for control participants. A composite measure of psychiatric hospital costs (state and local hospitals and local crisis stabilization units) declined by $3,539 monthly during the first quarter after PACT enrollment (p.01). Differences were noted up to 27 months after enrollment, when the difference in the composite costs measure became insignificant compared with the prior quarter (months 25-27) (p.05). Differences were larger for PACT enrollees with greater baseline state hospital use. CONCLUSIONS The time-varying estimates may have implications for the length and intensity of ACT enrollment. However, the optimum time for receipt of ACT services needs to be considered in the context of outcomes other than hospitalization alone.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Washington State's PACT, a recovery-oriented assertive community treatment (ACT) initiative, in reducing state psychiatric hospital use. METHODS A quasi-experimental design and administrative data were used to compare 450 PACT consumers and 450 propensity score-matched consumers receiving usual care. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) assessed the effects of PACT on use of state and local hospitals, emergency departments, crisis stabilization units, and arrests. The marginal effects of PACT were estimated for high users and low users of state hospitals at baseline. RESULTS No difference between PACT participants and control participants was observed in the probability of having any state hospital use. A reduction in state hospital use of between 32 and 33 days per person per year was observed (p.01). Reductions in state hospital costs were concentrated among PACT participants who had high state hospital use at baseline; cost reductions ranged from about $17,000 to $20,000 per person per year (p.01). State hospital cost reductions were partially offset by increases in use of local services, with small but significant (p.01) increases in local hospital use, use of emergency departments, and use of crisis stabilization services. CONCLUSIONS PACT had its greatest effects for consumers who were high utilizers of state psychiatric hospitals at baseline. Contrary to studies and commentaries from the United Kingdom, ACT remains a viable intervention in areas where state hospitals are overused. Whether blending traditional ACT with recovery-oriented practices also promotes consumer recovery requires further study.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents findings from a study of the therapeutic effects of group art therapy in a psychotherapy unit of a Russian hospital for war veterans. The researchers randomly assigned 112 veterans being treated for stress-related disorders to an experimental group (art therapy) and a control group. The emphasis was on the use of humor in the Draw A Story assessment and the Silver Drawing Test with respect to cognition, emotions, creativity, and self-image. Findings included a high frequency of humorous responses in both groups, and an increase of humor in the art therapy group post treatment. Results suggest that image formation and artistic activity foster cognitive and creative problem solving and increased self-esteem, and that humor serves as an important therapeutic function in this population.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: In most public mental health systems, assertive community treatment (ACT) is a key service for people with severe mental illness. Although considerable research supports the effectiveness of ACT as an evidence-based practice, other research indicates a failure to adequately implement or sustain ACT, resulting in a diminishing quality of services over time. There have been relatively few attempts to develop and test strategies for implementing new ACT teams and for ensuring their operational and service quality over time. The authors provide a heuristic model for administrators and providers seeking to implement and sustain high-quality ACT programs. METHODS: The authors conducted a selected review of literature about implementation and sustainability of ACT published between January 2000 and May 2011. The review was supplemented by the authors' experiences as researchers, administrators, trainers and consultants, and practitioners. RESULTS: A total of 57 articles were found by searches in PsycINFO and PubMed. The authors propose four major approaches for assessing and ensuring the quality of ACT programs-policy and administrative, training and consultation, team operational, and program evaluation-and identify strategies for achieving the goals in each category. CONCLUSIONS: Although a scarcity of rigorous research makes firm conclusions difficult, the authors conclude that no single strategy is sufficient for ensuring adequate ACT implementation and services of consistently good quality. Rather, it is useful to implement a blend of policy and administrative, training and consultation, team operational, and program evaluation strategies. Additional rigorous research on implementing and sustaining the quality of ACT and other evidence-based practices is needed.

        <ab>Objective: African Americans underutilize traditional mental health services, compared with white Americans. The authors conducted a systematic review of studies involving church-based health promotion programs for mental disorders among African Americans to assess the feasibility of utilizing such programs to address racial disparities in mental health care.Methods: A literature review of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ATLA Religion databases was conducted to identify articles published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2009. Inclusion criteria were as follows: studies were conducted in a church; the primary objective involved assessment, perceptions and attitudes, education, prevention, group support, or treatment for DSM-IV mental disorders or their correlates; number of participants was reported; qualitative or quantitative data were reported; and African Americans were the target population.Results: Of 1,451 studies identified, only eight met inclusion criteria. Five studies focused on substance-related disorders, six were designed to assess the effects of a specific intervention, and six targeted adults. One study focused on depression and was limited by a small sample size of seven participants.Conclusions: Although church-based health promotion programs have been successful in addressing racial disparities for several chronic medical conditions, the literature on such programs for mental disorders is extremely limited. More intensive research is needed to establish the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing church-based health promotion programs as a possible resource for screening and treatment to improve disparities in mental health care for African Americans.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study used a controlled research design to examine the effects on children of treating their mothers' depression and of remission of the mothers' depression. METHOD: The sample consisted of 60 low-income women with major depression, who were predominantly from minority racial-ethnic groups, and their children ages four to 11. Women were randomly assigned to receive one of two active treatments (medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy) or a referral to existing community services. The mothers' depression was assessed by self-report on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the children's symptoms and adaptive skills were assessed by their mothers at baseline and six-month and 12-month follow-ups with the Behavior Assessment System for Children. RESULTS: Mixed-effects random intercept and random slope repeated-measures analyses using an intent-to-treat approach indicated that active treatment of mothers did not result in improvement in their children's behavior problems or adaptive skills. However, at both the six- and the 12-month follow-ups, children of mothers whose depression had remitted, regardless of treatment assignment, had significantly fewer behavior problems than children whose mothers remained depressed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the need to expand access to, and support participation in, depression treatment among low-income women from minority racial-ethnic groups. Although treatment alone of this undertreated population was not associated with improvement in children's outcomes, it is a necessary first step to prevent psychopathology among offspring of depressed parents.

        <ab>Mental health intervention research requires clear and accurate specification of treatment conditions in intervention studies. Measures are increasingly available for community-based interventions for persons with serious mental illnesses. Measures must go beyond structural features to assess critical processes in interventions. They must also balance effectiveness, or adequate coverage of active treatment elements, with efficiency, or the degree to which measures may be used cost-effectively. The context of their use is changing with the emergence of new frameworks for implementation research and quality improvement. To illustrate a range of approaches, this article describes four recently developed fidelity measures: Cognitive Therapy for Psychosis Adherence Scale, Strengths Model Fidelity Scale, Illness Management and Recovery Program Fidelity Scale, and Tool for Measurement of ACT. The fidelity measures assess interventions in a range of treatment contexts from dyads to teams. Each measure focuses assessment resources on critical elements. Each has demonstrated coverage of its target intervention and satisfactory psychometric properties and is related to outcomes. Measures have been used for training, quality improvement, or certification. They assess domains and have uses beyond their nominal position in implementation and quality frameworks. This review of recent fidelity measures indicates that process components in community-based interventions can be effectively assessed. Omission of elements assessing potentially critical active treatment components poses risk to both research and practice until there is evidence to demonstrate that they are nonessential. Further development of fidelity measurement theory and approaches should proceed in conjunction with development of theory and methods in implementation science.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Up to 70% of adolescents with moderate to severe unipolar major depression respond to psychological treatment plus Fluoxetine (20-50 mg) with symptom reduction and improved social function reported by 24 weeks after beginning treatment. Around 20% of non responders appear treatment resistant and 30% of responders relapse within 2 years. The specific efficacy of different psychological therapies and the moderators and mediators that influence risk for relapse are unclear. The cost-effectiveness and safety of psychological treatments remain poorly evaluated.Methods/design: Improving Mood with Psychoanalytic and Cognitive Therapies, the IMPACT Study, will determine whether Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or Short Term Psychoanalytic Therapy is superior in reducing relapse compared with Specialist Clinical Care. The study is a multicentre pragmatic effectiveness superiority randomised clinical trial: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy consists of 20 sessions over 30 weeks, Short Term Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy 30 sessions over 30 weeks and Specialist Clinical Care 12 sessions over 20 weeks. We will recruit 540 patients with 180 randomised to each arm. Patients will be reassessed at 6, 12, 36, 52 and 86 weeks. Methodological aspects of the study are systematic recruitment, explicit inclusion criteria, reliability checks of assessments with control for rater shift, research assessors independent of treatment team and blind to randomization, analysis by intention to treat, data management using remote data entry, measures of quality assurance, advanced statistical analysis, manualised treatment protocols, checks of adherence and competence of therapists and assessment of cost-effectiveness. We will also determine whether time to recovery and/or relapse are moderated by variations in brain structure and function and selected genetic and hormone biomarkers taken at entry.Discussion: The objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether there are specific effects of specialist psychotherapy that reduce relapse in unipolar major depression in adolescents and thereby costs of treatment to society. We also anticipate being able to utilise psychotherapy experience, neuroimaging, genetic and hormone measures to reveal what techniques and their protocols may work best for which patients.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN83033550.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE The authors investigated levels of social inclusion among service users of two types of psychiatric community housing programs in the Netherlands. METHODS A large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted that included service users of community housing programs (N=255) and their key workers (N=75). Data on social inclusion-participating in activities, receiving and making visits, and vocational participation-were collected through a service user diary. Univariate regression analyses were performed with the social inclusion variables as the dependent variables and type of housing program (supported independent living versus residential care) as the independent variable. RESULTS Service users living independently were more likely to feel socially included, in terms of activities and visits, than residents. Type of housing program was not associated with vocational participation. CONCLUSIONS Although service users living independently were more likely than residents to be socially included, their vocational participation was similar to that of residents. It seems that for both groups of service user, it is important to improve the availability of vocational interventions or programs.</ab>

        <ab>Medicare and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) base reimbursement partly on hospital readmission rates, but there is little guidance for providers to reduce these rates. This column describes a model of care used by Washington Heights Community Service (WHCS) in New York City. Without benefit of external funding, WHCS has implemented practices, such as family involvement at all treatment levels, community outreach, effective medication prescribing, shared electronic medical records, and proactive provider communication, that have led to lower rates of readmission in addition to low rates of admission and emergency room use and a high rate of outpatient follow-up-all particularly relevant in this era of ACA mandates.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Computer-assisted therapies offer a novel, cost-effective strategy for providing evidence-based therapies to a broad range of individuals with psychiatric disorders. However, the extent to which the growing body of randomized trials evaluating computer-assisted therapies meets current standards of methodological rigor for evidence-based interventions is not clear.Method: A methodological analysis of randomized clinical trials of computer-assisted therapies for adult psychiatric disorders, published between January 1990 and January 2010, was conducted. Seventy-five studies that examined computer-assisted therapies for a range of axis I disorders were evaluated using a 14-item methodological quality index.Results: Results indicated marked heterogeneity in study quality. No study met all 14 basic quality standards, and three met 13 criteria. Consistent weaknesses were noted in evaluation of treatment exposure and adherence, rates of follow-up assessment, and conformity to intention-to-treat principles. Studies utilizing weaker comparison conditions (e.g., wait-list controls) had poorer methodological quality scores and were more likely to report effects favoring the computer-assisted condition.Conclusions: While several well-conducted studies have indicated promising results for computer-assisted therapies, this emerging field has not yet achieved a level of methodological quality equivalent to those required for other evidence-based behavioral therapies or pharmacotherapies. Adoption of more consistent standards for methodological quality in this field, with greater attention to potential adverse events, is needed before computer-assisted therapies are widely disseminated or marketed as evidence based.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The BRIGHT (Building Recovery by Improving Goals, Habits, and Thoughts) study was a community-based effectiveness trial that compared residential substance abuse treatment with residential treatment plus group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)for depression. This brief report focuses on the subgroup of participants with major depression.Methods: The authors used a quasi-experimental design and an intent-to-treat analysis. Out of 299 participants enrolled, 135 had major depression. Primary outcomes were change in depression symptoms, mental health functioning, and days of alcohol use and problematic substance use.Results: At the three-month follow-up, participants with major depression reported less severe depression and better functioning, compared with participants with major depression who received usual care. At six months, functioning continued to be higher and problem substance use was lower.Conclusions: Group CBT was an effective treatment for major depression for clients in residential substance abuse treatment. These results extend the effectiveness of group CBT for major depression to a new setting, patient population, and type of provider.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study proposed to evaluate Veterans Health Administration (VHA) specialty mental health care workload for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental disorders between 2005 and 2010 in comparison with results from 1997 to 2005. The 2005-2010 time frame represents a period of increased utilization of services by recently returning veterans and of program expansion within VHA. METHODS: VHA administrative databases were queried for all veterans receiving specialty mental health treatment annually between 2005 and 2010. Veterans were categorized by military service era (WWII or Korea, Vietnam, post-Vietnam, Persian Gulf War [including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan], and peacetime or other), diagnosis (PTSD or a non-PTSD mental disorder), and deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. RESULTS: The total number of veterans served per year increased by 623,326 (117.6%) between 1997 and 2010. Veterans with PTSD increased at a greater rate since 2005 compared with veterans with other mental disorders. Vietnam veterans constituted a majority of all veterans treated for PTSD or for other mental disorders, and the number of Vietnam veterans treated for PTSD continues to grow. The number of visits per veteran with PTSD increased between 2006 and 2010, reversing previous trends. The rate of increase has been highest for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. CONCLUSIONS: Both the number treated and treatment intensity have increased for veterans with PTSD who served in current conflicts, which might be expected, and in the Vietnam era, now 30 years past. A reversal of past declines in treatment intensity coincides with an increase in PTSD treatment funding and program expansion since 2005.

        <ab>Objective: The study examined the degree to which trauma was addressed among clients being treated for a severe mental illness and a substance use disorder at a community mental health center.Methods: Participants (N=74) were a randomly selected sample of clients who were enrolled for at least two years in an outpatient clinic and who had at least one clinic visit in the month preceding the study's start. The primary diagnoses were schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (53%), bipolar disorder (24%), and major depression (23%), and all participants had a current or past substance use disorder. A majority had a history of trauma, including sexual trauma, physical assault, the loss of a family member, or having witnessed someone being killed or seriously injured.Results: Clients were asked about past sexual or physical assault history by a median of zero providers, and 59% said a history of assault was not addressed during treatment. Severity of posttraumatic stress disorder and the range of traumas experienced by the client were not predictors of the degree to which trauma and its consequences were a part of treatment. Clients' desire to discuss trauma during treatment and feeling upset while discussing trauma were both predictors of whether trauma was a focus of treatment.Conclusions: Clinicians may not adequately address trauma during treatment of severe mental illness. Future research is required to examine more effective methods to screen and treat trauma among individuals with severe mental illnesses.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Due to limited resources, waiting periods for psychotherapy are often long and burdening for those in need of treatment and the health care system. In order to bridge the gap between initial contact and the beginning of psychotherapy, web-based interventions can be applied. The implementation of a web-based depression intervention during waiting periods has the potential to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance well-being in depressive individuals waiting for psychotherapy.Methods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, effectiveness and acceptance of a guided web-based intervention for depressive individuals on a waitlist for psychotherapy are evaluated. Participants are recruited in several German outpatient clinics. All those contacting the outpatient clinics with the wish to enter psychotherapy receive study information and a depression screening. Those adults (age ≥ 18) with depressive symptoms above cut-off (CES-D scale &gt; 22) and internet access are randomized to either intervention condition (treatment as usual and immediate access to the web-based intervention) or waiting control condition (treatment as usual and delayed access to the web-based intervention). At three points of assessment (baseline, post-treatment, 3-months-follow-up) depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes, such as quality of life, attitudes towards psychotherapy and web-based interventions and adverse events are assessed. Additionally, participants' acceptance of the web-based intervention is evaluated, using measures of intervention adherence and satisfaction.Discussion: This study investigates a relevant setting for the implementation of web-based interventions, potentially improving the provision of psychological health care. The results of this study contribute to the evaluation of innovative and resource-preserving health care models for outpatient psychological treatment.Trial Registration: This trial has been registered on 13 February 2017 in the German clinical trials register (DRKS); registration number DRKS00010282 .</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Some literature suggests that compulsory community treatment orders (CTOs) are effective in reducing hospitalizations in a subgroup of psychiatric patients with histories of repeated hospitalization, allowing them to be treated in the community under less restrictive measures. However, studies have yielded contradictory findings, in part because of methodological differences. Our study examines the effectiveness of CTOs in reducing hospitalizations and increasing community tenure of such patients.Method: The sample included all psychiatric patients who had been given a CTO during a 9-year period at 2 of McGill University's hospitals. This is a naturalistic, observational, retrospective, before-and-after study where patients acted as their own control subjects. We examined variables, including the number, duration, and time to psychiatric admissions, comparing 4 time periods: early, pre-index, index (when the first CTO was in force), and post-index periods. The total study duration per subject encompasses the longest period of observation within existing studies in Canada.Results: Psychiatric patients with histories of frequent readmissions demonstrated a significant reduction in their number of hospitalizations as well as an increase in the median time to re-hospitalization, during the period when they were treated under a CTO. This effect of CTO was sustained even after the CTO had expired.Conclusions: Our study suggests that CTOs are effective in assisting psychiatric patients with histories of repeated hospitalizations to live and be treated in the community, diminishing the occurrence of frequent hospitalization.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Postpartum depression has been associated with parenting stress, impacting attachment and child development. However, the relation between antenatal depression or anxiety and postpartum parenting stress has not been investigated. We studied the effect of antenatal depression and anxiety and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (antidepressants [ADs]) on postpartum parenting stress.Method: Ninety-four pregnant women (part of a larger study examining prenatal AD exposure on infants) were prospectively monitored for depression and anxiety during the third trimester and 3- and 6-months postpartum using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Parenting stress was assessed using the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form at 3- and 6-months postpartum.Results: Both antenatal third trimester depression and anxiety were significant predictors of 3- and 6-month postpartum parenting stress, after controlling for maternal age, number of children, and exposure to prenatal ADs (all Ps &lt; 0.001). Third trimester depression accounted for 13% to 22% of the variance in postpartum stress at 3 and 6 months. Prenatal AD use was not a significant predictor in any of the models (all Ps &gt; 0.2). Twenty of 41 mothers on ADs achieved remission (HDRS = 7) in pregnancy and had average parenting stress scores of about 1 standard deviation lower than those who did not at 3- and 6-months postpartum (t = 3.32, df = 32, P = 0.002 and t = 2.52, df = 32, P = 0.02, respectively).Conclusions: Our findings indicate that antenatal depression and anxiety directly impact postpartum parenting stress, regardless of antenatal AD treatment. Ongoing maternal mental illness in pregnancy is an important predictor of postpartum parenting stress. Early recognition and treatment to remission is key.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cancer patients are at increased risk for depression compared with individuals with no cancer diagnosis, yet few interventions target depressed cancer patients.Methods: Efficacy of psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for depression in cancer patients who met an entry threshold for depressive symptoms was examined by meta-analysis. Five electronic databases were systematically reviewed to identify randomized controlled trials meeting the selection criteria. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges' g and were pooled to compare pre- and postrandomization depressive symptoms with a random effects model. Subgroup analyses tested moderators of effect sizes, such as comparison of different intervention modalities, with a mixed effects model. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Ten randomized controlled trials (six psychotherapeutic and four pharmacologic studies) met the selection criteria; 1362 participants with mixed cancer types and stages had been randomly assigned to treatment groups. One outlier trial was removed from analyses. The random effects model showed interventions to be superior to control conditions on reducing depressive symptoms postintervention (Hedges' g = 0.43, 95% confidence interval = 0.30 to 0.56, P &lt; .001). In the four psychotherapeutic trials with follow-up assessment, interventions were more effective than control conditions up to 12-18 months after patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (P &lt; .001). Although each approach was more effective than the control conditions in improving depressive symptoms (P &lt; .001), subgroup analyses showed that cognitive behavioral therapy appeared more effective than problem-solving therapy (P = .01), but not more effective than pharmacologic intervention (P = .07).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that psychological and pharmacologic approaches can be targeted productively toward cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Research is needed to maximize effectiveness, accessibility, and integration into clinical care of interventions for depressed cancer patients.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Knowledge of factors impacting adolescents' ability to adhere to their inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regimen is limited. The current study examines the collective impact of barriers to adherence and anxiety/depressive symptoms on adolescent adherence to the IBD regimen.Methods: Adolescents (n = 79) completed measures of barriers to adherence, adherence, and anxiety/depressive symptoms at one of two specialty pediatric IBD clinics.Results: Most adolescents reported barriers to adherence and 1 in 8 reported borderline or clinically elevated levels of anxiety/depressive symptoms. Anxiety/depressive symptoms moderated the relationship between barriers to adherence and adherence. Post hoc probing revealed a significant, additive effect of higher anxiety/depressive symptoms in the barriers-adherence relationship, with adherence significantly lower among adolescents with higher barriers and higher anxiety/depressive symptoms.Conclusions: In order to optimize adherence in adolescents, interventions should target not only barriers to adherence but also any anxiety/depressive symptoms that may negatively impact efforts to adhere to recommended treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Different lines of evidence suggest that low-level lead exposure could be a modifiable risk factor for adverse psychological symptoms, but little work has explored this relation.Objective: We assessed whether bone lead—a biomarker of cumulative lead exposure—is associated with depression and anxiety symptoms among middle-age and elderly women.Methods: Participants were 617 Nurses’ Health Study participants with K-shell X-ray fluorescence bone lead measures and who had completed at last one Mental Health Index 5-item scale (MHI-5) and the phobic anxiety scale of the Crown-Crisp Index (CCI) assessment at mean Â± SD age of 59 Â± 9 years (range, 41–83 years). With exposure expressed as tertiles of bone lead, we analyzed MHI-5 scores as a continuous variable using linear regression and estimated the odds ratio (OR) of a CCI score ≥ 4 using generalized estimating equations.Results: There were no significant associations between lead and either outcome in the full sample, but associations were found among premenopausal women and women who consistently took hormone replacement therapy (HRT) between menopause and bone lead measurement (n = 142). Compared with women in the lowest tertile of tibia lead, those in the highest scored 7.78 points worse [95% confidence interval (CI): –11.73, –3.83] on the MHI-5 (p-trend = 0.0001). The corresponding OR for CCI ≥ 4 was 2.79 (95% CI: 1.02, 7.59; p-trend = 0.05). No consistent associations were found with patella lead.Conclusions: These results provide support for an association of low-level cumulative lead exposure with increased depressive and phobic anxiety symptoms among older women who are premenopausal or who consistently take postmenopausal HRT.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: National Guard forces have deployed in large numbers to Iraq and Afghanistan since September 11, 2001. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess mental health symptoms, utilization of mental health services, and perceived barriers to service use among National Guard members and their significant others (including spouses and others with whom they share a committed relationship) from a Midwestern state.Methods: Participants were recruited for the study at military-sponsored reintegration workshops, which took place 45-90 days after service members' return from deployment. A sample of 332 National Guard members and 212 significant others volunteered to complete a survey that assessed mental health symptoms, service utilization, and barriers to treatment.Results: Forty percent of National Guard members and 34% of significant others met the screening criteria for one or more mental health problems. Of those meeting the criteria, 53% reported seeking help of some kind (50% of soldiers; 61% of significant others). Stigma associated with mental health care and concerns about service utilization appearing on military records ranked high as barriers among service members. Concerns about the influence of mental health issues on career advancement were of note. For significant others, barriers included the costs of mental health care, trouble with scheduling appointments, difficulty in getting time off work, and not knowing where to get help.Conclusions: The mental health effects of combat on the soldier and his or her significant other remain a challenge for National Guard families, who often reside in communities that show little understanding of the psychological costs of war. Barriers remain for mental health service utilization.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.Methods/design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are &lt;28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901796.</ab>

        <ab>This column describes the Center for Practice Innovations (CPI), which was created in 2007 by the New York State Office of Mental Health and the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University. CPI uses innovative approaches to build stakeholder collaborations, develop and maintain practitioners' expertise, and build agency infrastructures that support implementing and sustaining evidence-based practices. CPI's five core initiatives provide training in co-occurring mental and substance use disorders, assertive community treatment, supported employment and education, wellness self-management, and treatment of first-episode psychosis. Central to CPI's activities are award-winning training modules, statewide learning collaboratives, and use of a learning management system.</ab>

        <ab>This column describes a partnership between the Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA) and the Division of Psychiatric Services Research, Department of Psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine, that has implemented several evidence-based and emerging practices, such as supported employment, family psychoeducation, assertive community treatment, treatment for co-occurring mental and substance use disorders, and services for transition-age youths. The public-academic partnership has also created a separate center that employs a variety of approaches and tools to evaluate implementation fidelity and the quality and outcomes of services. These data are used by the legislature and by the governor and his executive staff to develop new policies and improvement strategies and monitor priority initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To estimate the impact of deductibles on the initiation and continuation of psychotherapy for depression.Data Sources/study Setting: Data from health care encounters and claims from Group Health Cooperative, a large integrated health care system in Washington State, was merged with information from a centralized behavioral health triage call center to conduct study analyses.Study Design: A retrospective observational design using a hierarchical logistic regression model was used to estimate initiation and continuation probabilities for use of psychotherapy, adjusting for key sociodemographic/economic factors and prior use of behavioral health services relevant to individual decisions to seek mental health care.Data Collection/extraction Methods: Analyses were based on merged datasets on patient enrollment, insurance benefits, use of mental health and general medical services and information collected by a triage specialist at a centralized behavioral health call center.Principal Findings: Among individuals with unmet deductibles between $100 and $500, we found a statistically significant lower likelihood of making an initial visit, but there was no statistically significant effect on making an initial or subsequent visit among individuals that had met their deductible.Conclusions: Unmet deductibles appear to influence the likelihood of initiating psychotherapy for treating depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To discuss psychotherapies for depression and anxiety that have emerged in recent years and to evaluate their current level of empirical support. Method: An electronic and a manual literature search of psychotherapies for mood and anxiety disorders were conducted. Results: Five new therapies for mood disorders and 3 interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder with co-occurring substance abuse met criteria for inclusion in this review. Fewer psychotherapies have been developed for other anxiety disorders. Although research for some of the psychotherapies has demonstrated superiority to usual care, none have firmly established efficacy or specific benefits over other established psychotherapies. Conclusions: A plurality of the new psychotherapies introduced and established in the past 5 years have been different assimilations of previously established cognitive-behavioural, interpersonal, or psychodynamic models. While initial results are promising for some, more rigorous efficacy trials and replications are necessary before conclusions can be drawn regarding their relative benefits.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This evaluation study elicited feedback from participants in a novel program intended to help posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) clinical managers address organizational challenges in providing services and improving care. METHODS: Program participants were invited to respond to an online survey developed for this study; 46% (N=121) responded. RESULTS: Two-thirds of survey respondents had engaged in mentoring program activities ten or more times in the past six months. Roughly half the respondents reported that the program helped them be more connected to other clinics, learn about innovations in care, and feel more supported. Those who participated more often ([beta]=.25, p.01) and rated their mentors highly ([beta]=.59, p.01) reported greater benefits from the program. CONCLUSIONS: Mentees who were actively engaged with the mentoring program reported significant benefits. Efforts are under way to enhance the program by strengthening mentor selection and training.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study evaluated the progress at one year of England's Time to Change (TTC) program, launched in 2009, toward meeting its target to reduce mental health-related stigma and discrimination by 5%.Methods: TTC comprises three national components: antistigma marketing campaign activities, mass physical exercise events (Time to Get Moving) to facilitate social contact between people with and without mental health problems, and an online resource on mental health and employment (Time to Challenge). Part of the TTC evaluation consists of an annual national phone survey of mental health service users. Participants (537 in 2008 and 1,047 in 2009) were current outpatient service users aged 18-65 registered with National Health Service community mental health teams that are selected annually to represent the range of socioeconomic deprivation. Telephone interviews were conducted with service users with the Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC) to document experienced discrimination and anticipated discrimination in the past 12 months.Results: One or more experiences of discrimination were reported by 9-1% of participants in 2008 and 87% of participants in 2009 (p = .03). In 2009 significantly less discrimination was reported from a number of common sources, including family (reported by 53% in 2008 and 46% in 2009), friends (53% and 39%), finding employment (24% and 16%), and keeping employment (from 17% to 13%). Experiences of discrimination from mental health professionals did not change significantly (reported by about one-third of participants in both years).Conclusions: Results suggest positive progress toward meeting the program's targeted 5% reduction in discrimination.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Delays in care after abnormal cancer screening contribute to disparities in cancer outcomes. Women with psychiatric disorders are less likely to receive cancer screening and may also have delays in diagnostic resolution after an abnormal screening test.Objective: To determine if depression and anxiety are associated with delays in resolution after abnormal mammograms and Pap tests in a vulnerable population of urban women.Design: We conducted retrospective chart reviews of electronic medical records to identify women who had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety in the year prior to the abnormal mammogram or Pap test. We used time-to-event analysis to analyze the outcome of time to resolution after abnormal cancer screening, and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to control for confounding.Participants: Women receiving care in six Boston-area community health centers 2004-2005: 523 with abnormal mammograms, 474 with abnormal Pap tests.Results: Of the women with abnormal mammogram and pap tests, 19% and 16%, respectively, had co-morbid depression. There was no difference in time to diagnostic resolution between depressed and not-depressed women for those with abnormal mammograms (aHR = 0.9, 95 CI 0.7,1.1) or Pap tests (aHR = 0.9, 95 CI 0.7,1.3).Conclusions: An active diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety in the year prior to an abnormal mammogram or Pap test was not associated with a prolonged time to diagnostic resolution. Our findings imply that documented mood disorders do not identify an additional barrier to resolution after abnormal cancer screening in a vulnerable population of women.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Supported housing programs have been successful in helping homeless adults obtain housing. This study examined whether improvements in social integration occur after clients obtain supported housing. METHODS: Measures of social integration were examined for 550 chronically homeless adults with mental illness who participated in the 11-site Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness. Social integration was conceptualized as a multidimensional construct of variables in six domains: housing, work, social support, community participation, civic activity, and religious faith. Changes in baseline measures related to the six domains and their interrelationships were examined at six and 12 months after entry into the supported housing program. RESULTS: Chronically homeless adults showed substantial improvements in housing but remained socially isolated and showed limited improvement in other domains of social integration, which were only weakly correlated with one another. CONCLUSIONS: More attention is needed to develop rehabilitation interventions in supported housing programs to improve social integration of chronically homeless adults. Because improvements in some domains of social integration were only weakly related, it may be necessary to intervene in multiple domains simultaneously.

        <ab>Objective: The authors examined the effects of a collaborative care intervention for anxiety disorders in primary care on lower-income participants relative to those with higher incomes. They hypothesized that lower-income individuals would show less improvement or improve at a lower rate, given that they would experience greater economic stress over the treatment course. An alternative hypothesis was that lower-income participants would improve at a higher rate because the intervention facilitates access to evidence-based treatment, which typically is less available to persons with lower incomes.Method: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with lower (N=287) and higher (N=717) income were compared using t tests and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. For the longitudinal analysis of intervention effects by income group, the outcome measures were jointly modeled at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months by study site, income, time, intervention, time and intervention, income and time, income and intervention, and time, intervention, and income.Results: Although lower-income participants were more ill and had greater disability at baseline than those with higher incomes, the two income groups were similar in clinical response. The lower-income participants experienced a comparable degree of clinical improvement, despite receiving fewer treatment sessions, less relapse prevention, and less continuous care.Conclusions: These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion as to whether or not, and to what extent, quality improvement interventions work equally well across income groups or require tailoring for specific vulnerable populations.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the predictors of actions to initiate involuntary commitment of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. METHODS: Emergency services clinicians throughout Virginia completed a questionnaire following each face-to-face evaluation of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. Over a one-month period in 2007, a total of 2,624 adults were evaluated. Logistic hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between demographic, clinical, and service-related variables and outcomes of the emergency evaluations. RESULTS: Several factors predicted 84% of the actions taken to initiate involuntary commitment. These included unavailability of alternatives to hospitalization, such as temporary housing or residential crisis stabilization; evaluation of the client in a hospital emergency room or police station or while in police custody; current enrollment in treatment; and clinical factors related to the commitment criteria, including risk of self-harm or harm to others, acuity and severity of the crisis, and current drug abuse or dependence. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of intensive community-based treatment and support in lieu of hospitalization accounted for a significant portion of variance in actions to initiate involuntary commitment. Comprehensive community services and supports for individuals experiencing mental health crises may reduce the rate of involuntary hospitalization. There is a need to enrich intensive community mental health services and supports and to evaluate the impact of these enhancements on the frequency of involuntary mental health interventions.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Nationwide studies contrasting service use of racial-ethnic groups provide an overview of disparities, but because of variation in populations and service systems, local studies are required to identify specific targets for remedial action. The authors report on the use of non-inpatient services regulated in New York State (NYS) and report use by the state's larger cultural groups. METHODS Data from the NYS Patient Characteristics Survey were used to estimate annual treated prevalence and treatment intensity, defined as the average number of annual weeks in service for non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and non-Hispanic whites. The latter rates were obtained for specific types of treatment use, by person's age and diagnosis, for the state and for population density-defined regions. Statistical methods contrasted rates of whites with other groups. RESULTS A total of 578,496 individuals in these racial-ethnic groups were served in 2,500 programs, and 51% of those served were nonwhite. Treated prevalence rates of whites were lower than those of blacks and Hispanics and were substantially higher than prevalence rates for Asians. Statewide treatment intensity rates of all racial-ethnic and age groups were comparable except for lower use among Asians 65. Key findings from granular analyses were lower treatment intensity rates for black youths with disruptive disorders, Hispanic adults with anxiety disorders, and Asians 65 with depression compared with white counterparts. In upstate metropolitan areas, black youths and Hispanic adults received services in fewer weeks than whites, and in the New York City metropolitan area, whites 65 had higher treatment intensity rates than contrast groups. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest a need for assistance to black families in negotiating the multiple systems used by their children, clinical training focusing on cultural symptom presentation, screening of Asians in community settings, and mandated cultural competency assessments for all programs.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To identify clinical and sociodemographic characteristics associated with suicidal ideation (SI) among patients seeking care for depression in routine primary and psychiatric care settings.Methods: We examined data from 4041 treatment-seeking outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) to compare baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of those with and without SI, and the presence or absence of baseline depressive symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities in those with SI.Results: SI was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) associated with numerous sociodemographic characteristics (that is, lower level of education, Caucasian or African American, male, unemployed, and treated in psychiatric care) and clinical features (that is, previous suicide attempt, younger age of MDD onset, greater baseline depressive symptom severity, greater number of depressive symptoms, and presence of agoraphobia and [or] generalized anxiety disorder). Elevated levels of SI at baseline were associated with decreased remission rates.Conclusions: Consistent with past findings, increased rates of SI were associated with greater depressive symptom severity as well as other features suggestive of severity of illness. Our results confirm previous findings of associations between SI and panic and (or) phobic symptoms and anxiety, but did not confirm previous findings of an association between SI and alcohol or drug use and (or) dependence. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy appeared significantly helpful in reducing SI during the course of treatment, the presence of SI at baseline was found to be a associated with decreased treatment response, with patients reporting SI at the start of treatment being less likely to achieve remission.Clinical Trial Registration Number: Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, NCT00021528.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Data from a managed care health system were used to examine demographic, clinical, and health system predictors of early dropout from psychotherapy for depression. Methods: A total of 238 members of a mixed-model health plan calling to request an initial psychotherapy visit for depression completed a brief survey regarding depression severity, perceived need for treatment, and expected benefit. Claims records were used to assess therapy visits attended over the following 90 days. Results: Dropout rates before the first therapy visit were somewhat higher among women (p=.041) and younger members (p=.017), moderately higher among those with lower depression severity (p=.012), and markedly higher among callers referred to network-model psychotherapists (compared with those given appointments with group-model therapists at health plan clinics) (p&lt;.001). By the second visit, however, cumulative dropout rates were similar for group- and network-model therapists. The only significant predictors of cumulative dropout rates before the second visit were less severe depression at the screening call (p=.004) and lower self-rated importance of initiating psychotherapy (p=.046). Conclusions: Early dropout from psychotherapy for depression was only weakly related to consumers' demographic characteristics. Dropout rates were lower among those with more severe depression, but a significant number of persons with moderate or severe symptoms of depression still discontinued treatment before the second visit. Allocation of visits for individual consumers was markedly different for group- and network-model psychotherapists, but these data did not allow for examination of differences in outcomes for those two treatment models.</ab>

        <ab>The incidence, factor structure and scale item differences in anxiety-depression comorbidity were investigated in a sample of Australian university students defined according to the presence of anxiety and/or depression. The incidence of anxiety-depression comorbidity was over 32%, about four times that for anxiety or depression alone. Participants with comorbidity had significantly higher Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) total and factor scores than those with anxiety or depression alone. The major differences between the comorbid and unitary disordered subgroups were for self-disintegration and autonomic arousal. Comorbidity of anxiety and depression is a more serious disorder than either anxiety or depression alone, and appears to exist in large proportions among university students. Assessment and treatment plans might benefit from inclusion of this comorbidity.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This article describes the creation, validation, and use of an assertive community treatment (ACT) Transition Readiness Scale (TRS) to identify clients who may be ready to transition from ACT services. Scale development was prompted by concerns over long stays on ACT teams and the resulting impact on access. METHODS: Data were extracted from a centralized clinical reporting system for all 1,365 persons enrolled for at least 12 months as of August 2008 in the 42 ACT teams in New York City, including 382 clients of eight of those ACT teams. Data in seven domains deemed relevant to transition readiness were used to calculate readiness scores for each client. An algorithm assigned clients to one of three categories: consider for transition, readiness unclear, and not ready. RESULTS: Via the TRS algorithm, of the 1,365 clients, 192 (14%) were assigned to the consider-for-transition group, 382 (28%) to the unclear group, and 791 (58%) to the not ready group. Clinicians on the eight ACT teams categorized 15% of their current clients in the consider-for-transition group, whereas the TRS algorithm classified 18% in this category. Overall, the TRS agreed with the category assigned by ACT team clinicians in 69% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The TRS may provide ACT teams and program administrators with a tool to identify clients who may be ready to transition to less intensive services, thereby opening scarce slots. Because ACT cases are complex, data summaries can offer useful syntheses of information, particularly when data from several assessments are used to summarize a client's trajectory.

        <ab>Objective: The study described service utilization among children with emotional and behavioral disorders making a first visit to outpatient mental health clinics in four Midwest cities.Methods: Data were from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms study. A total of 707 youths aged six to 12 years 11 months and their parents completed diagnostic assessments; demographic information and mental health service use was self-reported. Analyses examined the relationship of demographic variables, diagnoses, impairment, and comorbidity with type and level of services utilized.Results: Utilization was multimodal; half the youths had received outpatient and school services during their lifetime. Factors unrelated to need (age, sex, race, and insurance) were associated with service type. Children with a bipolar spectrum disorder had higher use of inpatient services than those with depressive or disruptive disorders and were more likely to currently use two or more services. More than half of youths with bipolar or depressive disorders had lifetime use of both medication and therapy, whereas youths with a disruptive behavior disorder were more likely to have used only therapy. Impairment and comorbidity were not related to service utilization.Conclusions: Use of services began at a very young age and occurred in multiple service sectors. Type of service used was related to insurance and race, underscoring the need for ongoing disparities research. Contrary to findings from administrative data analyses, use of medication alone was infrequent. The low rate of use of combination therapy suggests that clinicians and families need to be educated about the effectiveness of multimodal treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Interventions that promote healthier lifestyles among Latinos often involve community health workers (CHWs). CHWs can effectively advocate for healthier lifestyles and may be pivotal in addressing such mental health conditions as depression and anxiety. The goal of this study was to characterize the relationship dynamics between Latino participants and CHWs, from the participant’s perspective. We aimed to determine if CHW-delivered community interventions effected behavior change, especially among participants who reported anxiety and depression. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 28 Latino participants that was based on a mental health scoring strata. Participants completed a lifestyle intervention that included multiple home visits from CHWs to promote physical activity and healthful food choice. Interviews were conducted in the participant’s preferred language (English or Spanish). Transcribed interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory approach until concept saturation was achieved. Results: The sample was primarily female (82%), lower socioeconomic status (64%), and mean age of 50 years. Participants discussed the rapport building and professionalism of CHWs as a feature that facilitated strong, positive relationships and lifestyle behavior changes. Participants described how CHWs patterned their change approaches, which were similar to commonly used therapeutic techniques in the treatment of anxiety and depression. While anxiety and depression were described as having an impact on behavior change, most, but not all, participants who reported negative mood states said that the CHW relationship helped in changing that state to some extent. Conclusions: Participants’ perceptions indicated that positive personal changes were influenced by CHWs. Only participants who reported consistently poor scores for depression, anxiety or both reported negative or neutral experiences with the CHWs. This study lends qualitative support to the use of CHWs as extenders of care, particularly in areas that have a shortage of primary and mental health care providers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The serious mental illness Health Improvement Profile [HIP] is a brief pragmatic tool, which enables mental health nurses to work together with patients to screen physical health and take evidence-based action when variables are identified to be at risk. Piloting has demonstrated clinical utility and acceptability.Methods/design: A single blind parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial with secondary economic analysis and process observation. Unit of randomisation: mental health nurses [MHNs] working in adult community mental health teams across two NHS Trusts.Subjects: Patients over 18 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder on the caseload of participating MHNs.Primary Objective: To determine the effects of the HIP programme on patients' physical wellbeing assessed by the physical component score of the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) 36 Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 [SF-36v2].Secondary Objectives: To determine the effects of the HIP programme on: cost effectiveness, mental wellbeing, cardiovascular risk, physical health care attitudes and knowledge of MHNs and to determine the acceptability of the HIP Programme in the NHS. Consented nurses (and patients) will be randomised to receive the HIP Programme or treatment as usual. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 months with a process observation after 12 months to include evaluation of patients' and professionals' experience and observation of any effect on care plans and primary-secondary care interface communication. Outcomes will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.Discussion: The results of the trial and process observation will provide information about the effectiveness of the HIP Programme in supporting MHNs to address physical comorbidity in serious mental illness. Given the current unacceptable prevalence of physical comorbidity and mortality in the serious mental illness population, it is hoped the HIP trial will provide a timely contribution to evidence on organisation and delivery of care for patients, clinicians and policy makers.Trial Registration: Isrctn: ISRCTN41137900.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: A randomized cluster controlled trial tested the hypothesis that weekly feedback to clinicians would improve the effectiveness of home-based mental health treatment received by youths in community settings. METHODS: Youths, caregivers, and clinicians at 28 sites in ten states completed assessments of the youths' symptoms and functioning every other week. Clinicians at 13 sites were provided with weekly feedback about the assessments, and clinicians at 15 sites received feedback every 90 days. Data were collected from June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted with hierarchical linear modeling of data provided by youths, caregivers, and clinicians. RESULTS: Assessments by youths, caregivers, and clinicians indicated that youths (N=173) treated at sites where clinicians could receive weekly feedback improved faster than youths (N=167) treated at sites where clinicians did not receive weekly feedback. A dose-response analysis showed even stronger effects when clinicians viewed more feedback reports. CONCLUSIONS: Routine measurement and feedback can be used to improve outcomes for youths who receive typical home-based services in the community. (Psychiatric Services 62:1423-1429, 2011).</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This pilot study tested the effectiveness of culturally tailored, telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for improving depression outcomes among Latino primary care patients living in rural settings.Methods: A total of 101 Latino patients at a rural family medical center who met criteria for probable major depression were randomly assigned to enhanced usual care or eight sessions of CBT delivered by phone by trained bilingual therapists from the community. Blinded study assistants assessed depression symptom severity, using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL) depression items and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and patient satisfaction after six weeks, three months, and six months. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate intervention effects over time. For cross-sectional analyses, attrition weights were used to account for missing data.Results: In intent-to-treat analyses, patients who received CBT by phone were more likely to experience improvement in depression scores over the six-month follow-up period compared with patients who received enhanced usual care (β=-.41, t=-2.36, df=219, p=.018, for the SCL; and β=-3.51, t=-2.49, df=221, p=.013, for the PHQ-9). A greater proportion of patients in the CBT group than in the group that received enhanced usual care achieved treatment response at three months (p=.017), as indicated by a 50% improvement in SCL depression score or a score &lt;.75, and reported high satisfaction with treatment (p=.013).Conclusions: Although limited by small sample size, pilot results suggest culturally tailored, telephone-based CBT has the potential to enhance access to psychotherapy in an underserved Latino population with little access to mental health services.</ab>

        <ab>More than 100,000 offenders in the Texas correctional system have a mental illness, which represents about 19% of the state's correctional population, including offenders in prison and under community correctional supervision. To reduce these numbers, a leading mental health service provider established the Community Reintegration Program (CRP) to divert misdemeanor offenders with mental illness to community-based treatment. This column describes a collaborative process between the University of Texas at San Antonio and community partners to develop a utilization-focused evaluation plan for the CRP that would benefit all stakeholders. The evaluation used data collected as part of routine clinical work.</ab>

        <ab>Recent social changes and rising social inequality in the rural United States have affected the experience and meaning of mental illness and treatment seeking within rural communities. Rural Americans face serious mental health disparities, including higher rates of suicide and depression compared with residents of urban areas, and substance abuse rates in rural areas now equal those in urban areas. Despite these increased risks, people living in rural areas are less likely than their urban counterparts to seek or receive mental health services. This Open Forum calls for a research agenda supported by anthropological theory and methods to investigate the significance of this changed rural social context for mental health.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE This study examined the effectiveness of assertive community treatment (ACT) for a group of psychiatric patients in Hong Kong with frequent hospital admissions. METHODS The study compared hospitalization and other outcomes among participants of a two-year ACT intervention and a control group who had received treatment as usual two years earlier. The patients were Chinese adult psychiatric patients who had three or more admissions in the 12 months before the study. RESULTS Seventy patients were recruited for each group. Although all the outcome measures decreased with time for both groups, repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that the treatment group had significantly greater reductions in readmission rate, length of stay, and total days between a missed medical appointment and the next service contact. CONCLUSIONS ACT was effective in reducing hospitalization and enhancing service contacts for a group of Chinese psychiatric patients with frequent hospital admissions.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Response to specific depression treatments varies widely among individuals. Understanding and predicting that variation could have great benefits for people living with depression.Method: The authors describe a conceptual model for identifying and evaluating evidence relevant to personalizing treatment for depression. They review evidence related to three specific treatment decisions: choice between antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, selection of a specific antidepressant medication, and selection of a specific psychotherapy. They then discuss potential explanations for negative findings as well as implications for research and clinical practice.Results: Many previous studies have examined general predictors of outcome, but few have examined true moderators (predictors of differential response to alternative treatments). The limited evidence indicates that some specific clinical characteristics may inform the choice between antidepressant medication and psychotherapy and the choice of specific antidepressant medication. Research to date does not identify any biologic or genetic predictors of sufficient clinical utility to inform the choice between medication and psychotherapy, the selection of specific medication, or the selection of a specific psychotherapy.Conclusions: While individuals vary widely in response to specific depression treatments, the variability remains largely unpredictable. Future research should focus on identifying true moderator effects and should consider how response to treatments varies across episodes. At this time, our inability to match patients with treatments implies that systematic follow-up assessment and adjustment of treatment are more important than initial treatment selection.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To identify the clinical specificity of men with severe mental illness (aged 18 to 40 years) by legal status.Method: Our study compared 85 inmates with 66 involuntarily hospitalized patients (IHPs) and 50 voluntarily hospitalized patients (VHPs) with at least one Axis I diagnosis of psychosis or major affective disorder. Sociodemographics, medical information, and criminal history were drawn from interviews, medical records, and official criminal records. We used the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to determine Axis I disorders and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Psychopathy was measured with the Psychopathy Checklist--Revised.Results: We found that inmates had a lower level of schooling (P = 0.001), were more likely to have been in an intimate relationship (P &lt; 0.001), and were less likely to have a psychiatric hospitalization history (P &lt; 0.001), compared with hospitalized patients. Inmates were also more likely to meet criteria for delusional disorders or psychosis not otherwise specified (P &lt; 0.001) and major depression (P = 0.001). IHPs were more likely to meet schizophrenia spectrum disorder criteria (P &lt; 0.001). Inmates had a higher level of comorbidity involving ASPD (P &lt; 0.001), psychopathy (P &lt; 0.001), and substance misuse (P &lt; 0.001). IHPs showed an intermediate level between inmates and VHPs for these comorbid disorders. VHPs had the lowest level of comorbidity with Axis I psychiatric diagnosis.Conclusion: Our clinical specificity hypothesis was supported: different psychopathological characteristics and social functioning profiles were identified by legal status. Specific integrated treatments should be considered for inmates and IHPs.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: This study explored whether racial and ethnic disparities in the treatment of depression and anxiety are associated with provider-level factors.Methods: This study analyzed 58,826 office-based adult outpatient visits to primary care physicians and psychiatrists. Data were from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2003-2007. Outcomes included counseling and referral for counseling, antidepressant prescription, and any care for depression or anxiety. The analyses of treatment outcomes were not limited to visits with a depression or anxiety diagnosis.Results: Compared with visits to primary care physicians by whites, such visits by blacks and Hispanics were less likely to result in antidepressant prescription or in any care for depression or anxiety; primary care visits by Hispanics were also less likely to result in counseling. Compared with visits to psychiatrists by whites, such visits by blacks were less likely to result in an antidepressant prescription. The majority of visits to both primary care physicians and psychiatrists by blacks and Hispanics were to practices serving a high percentage of nonwhite patients. However, racial and ethnic disparities in care that were especially evident in primary care settings persisted after the analyses controlled for whether visits were to settings with a high or low percentage of nonwhite patients.Conclusions: Disparities in care for depression and anxiety in primary care continue and are not fully accounted for by less care being provided in settings that nonwhites frequent. Physician bias, resource issues, and patient factors may all play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: This study described utilization of specialty treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), in Afghanistan, or of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), in Iraq, and non-OEF-OIF veterans recently diagnosed as having PTSD. It also identified predictors of receiving minimally adequate specialty treatment, defined as attending at least nine clinic visits within 365 days of screening positive for PTSD.Methods: VA administrative data were obtained for 869 veterans who screened positive for PTSD between November 7, 2006, and September 30, 2008, received a diagnosis of PTSD, and visited a PTSD specialty clinic operated by the VA in the Pacific Northwest at least once within a year of screening positive.Results: A total of 286 (33%) of the 852 veterans for whom complete data were available received minimally adequate specialty treatment; OEF-OIF veterans were less likely than non-OEF-OIF veterans to receive minimally adequate specialty treatment (29% versus 36%, p=.021) and attended fewer mean±SD visits to a PTSD clinic (8.2±11.4 versus 9.9±13.5, p=.045). Predictors of receiving minimally adequate specialty treatment included attending a PTSD clinic visit within 30 days of a positive screen, living in an urban location, and having psychiatric comorbidities.Conclusions: Most veterans with new PTSD diagnoses who initiated VA PTSD specialty care did not receive minimally adequate specialty treatment. Future studies should examine factors that lead to premature discontinuation of PTSD treatment and to what extent specialty treatment for PTSD is necessary.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess whether distance to services or diagnosis at a hospital-based medical center compared with a community clinic influences the receipt of psychotherapy versus pharmacotherapy for depression.Data Source: Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data for 132,329 depressed veterans between October 2003 and September 2004.Study Design: Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression models were used to examine the relationship between distance to the nearest mental health facility and the facility of initial depression diagnosis on receipt of any and adequate psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy, adjusted for patient characteristics.Principal Findings: Compared with those living within 30 miles of the nearest mental health treatment facility, depressed patients living between 30 and 60 miles away had a decreased likelihood of receiving psychotherapy (OR=0.71; 95 percent CI: 0.66, 0.76) and a greater likelihood of receiving antidepressant treatment (OR=1.27; 95 percent CI: 1.22, 1.33). Initial diagnosis at a small community clinic compared with a VA medical center was not associated with a difference in receipt of any psychotherapy (OR=0.95; 95 percent CI: 0.83, 1.09), but it was associated with decreased likelihood of receiving eight or more psychotherapy visits (OR=0.46; 95 percent CI: 0.35, 0.61) or any antidepressant treatment (OR=0.69; 95 percent CI: 0.63, 0.75).Conclusions: The VA and similar health systems should make efforts to insure adequate psychotherapy is provided to patients who initiate treatment at small community clinics and provide psychotherapy alternatives that may be less sensitive to travel barriers for patients living remote distances from mental health treatment. Extending services to small community clinics that support antidepressant treatment should also be considered.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Although effective mental health treatments exist, few population data are available on treatment receipt by persons with psychological distress. This study aimed to understand the association between symptoms and treatment receipt with data from the U.S Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey.Methods: In the 2007 survey, psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler-6 scale, and respondents were asked about receipt of mental health treatment. Data from 197,914 respondents were analyzed.Results: In the overall population 87.5% of respondents reported no psychological distress, 8.5% mild to moderate psychological distress, and 3.9% serious psychological distress. Those with serious distress were nearly ten times as likely to receive treatment (adjusted odds ratio=9.58, 95% confidence interval=8.53-10.75) as those with no distress. One in ten persons (10.7%) in the study population reported receiving treatment.Conclusions: Distinct U.S. subpopulations exist by treatment and symptom status. Better understanding of all these groups is essential for improving population-based mental health care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the prevalence of mental health and illness, the stability of both diagnoses over time, and whether changes in mental health level predicted mental illness in a cohort group. METHODS: In 2009, we analyzed data from the 1995 and 2005 Midlife in the United States cross-sectional surveys (n = 1723), which measured positive mental health and 12-month mental disorders of major depressive episode, panic, and generalized anxiety disorders. RESULTS: Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those flourishing in 1995 declined in 2005. Change in mental health was strongly predictive of prevalence and incidence (operationalized as a new, not necessarily a first, episode) of mental illness in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Gains in mental health predicted declines in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health promotion; losses of mental health predicted increases in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health protection.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Whereas many studies have examined the long-term toll of coping with an adult child's serious mental illness, relatively few have examined both the subjective burden and personal gains associated with this parenting role. This study investigated the stressors and resources related to burden and gains among older parents of adults with serious mental illness.Methods: The study was a secondary analysis of data collected in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Regression analysis of telephone and mailed responses of 111 parents of adults with serious mental illness was used to examine the stressors and resources associated with parental burden and gains.Results: Stressors that were positively associated with subjective burden included the amount of care provided to a child with serious mental illness; parents and children living in the same household was also positively associated, although it was not statistically significant (p=.07). Parents who received more assistance from an adult child with serious mental illness and those who were support group members reported less subjective burden and more gains. A higher number of confidants were also positively associated with gains. Parents who provided more assistance with activities of daily living to their adult child reported higher levels of gains.Conclusions: Findings suggest that recovery-oriented approaches to supporting families in later stages of life may involve creating opportunities for adults with serious mental illness to play positive roles in the lives of aging parents and in helping older parents recognize ways in which successfully coping with caregiving challenges may lead to personal gains.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study explored the experiences of adults with learning disabilities in the mental health system.Methods: Thirty-seven participants were clients at one of two community-based mental health agencies. Participants completed a standardized tool for assessment of a possible learning difficulty. Nineteen individuals met criteria, and nine participated in semistructured interviews.Results: The quantitative results indicated that participants were challenged by limited education, long-term mental illness, and homelessness. Qualitative themes concerned challenges in the areas of job skills, education, comprehension of paperwork, housing, social skills, comprehension of agency literature, low self-esteem, and accessing services.Conclusions: The findings may help inform social service providers about the service gap between the education and mental health systems. People with co-occurring disorders and learning disabilities represent a segment of the treatment population that may experience limited access to social services without modifications to service delivery.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Psychological distress can impact medical outcomes such as recovery from surgery and experience of side effects during treatment. Identifying the factors that explain variability in distress would guide future interventions aimed at decreasing distress. Two factors that have been implicated in distress are illness perceptions and coping, and are part of the Self-Regulatory Model of Illness Behaviour (SRM). The model suggests that coping mediates the relationship between illness perceptions and distress. Despite this; very little research has assessed this relationship with cancer-related distress, and none have examined women with screen-detected breast cancer. This study is the first to examine the relative contribution of illness perceptions and coping on general and cancer-related distress in women with screen-detected breast cancer.Methods: Women recently diagnosed with breast cancer (N = 94) who had yet to receive treatment completed measures of illness perceptions (Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire), cancer-specific coping (Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale), general anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), and cancer-related distress.Results: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that medical variables, illness perceptions and coping predicted 50% of the variance in depression, 42% in general anxiety, and 40% in cancer-related distress. Believing in more emotional causes to breast cancer (β = .22, p = .021), more illness identity (β = .25, p = .004), greater anxious preoccupation (β = .23, p = .030), and less fighting spirit (β = -.31, p = .001) predicted greater depression. Greater illness coherence predicted less cancer-related distress (β = -.20, p = .043). Greater anxious preoccupation also led to greater general anxiety (β = .44, p &lt; .001) and cancer-related distress (β = .37, p = .001). Mediation analyses revealed that holding greater beliefs in a chronic timeline, more severe consequences, greater illness identity and less illness coherence increases cancer-specific distress (ps &lt; .001) only if women were also more anxiously preoccupied with their diagnosis.Conclusions: Screening women for anxious preoccupation may help identify women with screen-detected breast cancer at risk of experiencing high levels of cancer-related distress; whilst illness perceptions and coping could be targeted for use in future interventions to reduce distress.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined health care utilization and costs of care among Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with depression and with or without symptoms of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Methods: Cross-sectional comparisons of health care utilization and costs were conducted with VA administrative data for a sample of veterans from a randomized trial of collaborative care depression treatment in ten VA primary care clinics across five states. Patients with depression or dysthymia were included in the study, and those who were acutely suicidal or had probable bipolar disorder were excluded. The sample of 606 patients was mainly male, white, and aged 55 or older. Health care utilization, costs, and medication data from VA administrative databases were analyzed over 12 months.Results: Patients with depression and PTSD (screen score &gt; or =3) were more emotionally distressed, had more frequent mental health specialty visits (6.91 versus 1.68, p&lt;.001), more total outpatient visits (26.16 versus 19.94, p&lt;.001), and correspondingly higher outpatient mental health care costs over the previous 12 months compared with depressed patients without PTSD. Antidepressants were prescribed to a higher proportion of depressed patients with PTSD (61% versus 40%).Conclusions: Patients with PTSD and depression had greater utilization of specialty mental health treatments and antidepressant medications and higher mental health care costs in the previous 12 months than depressed patients without PTSD. As military personnel return from Iraq, both VA and non-VA health care providers need to plan for an increase in outpatient mental health services and costs, particularly among depressed veterans who also have PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study sought to determine whether previously reported poor outcomes among patients of low socioeconomic status who have depression and anxiety could result from not receiving mental health treatment or from receiving minimally adequate treatment.Methods: The study sample consisted of 1,772 participants in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) who met criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between education, income, and assets and receipt of treatment and quality of treatment (minimally adequate treatment) for mood and anxiety disorders in sectors with the capacity to deliver evidence-based treatments (the general medical and mental health specialty sectors). Multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender, race-ethnicity, marital status, health insurance, and urbanicity.Results: Age, gender, marital status, and race-ethnicity were strong and fairly consistent predictors of mental health services use, with some modest variations by sector. In contrast, in bivariate and multivariate analyses, education, income, and assets were minimally related to use of mental health care and to receipt of minimally adequate care in both general medical and mental health specialty sectors.Conclusions: Socioeconomic status does not appear to play a major role in determining aspects of treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Poor outcomes of depressed and anxious patients with low socioeconomic status may be due to differences in quality of care beyond the minimally adequate level assessed in this study or to factors unrelated to quality of care that could counteract effective treatments, such as the presence of ongoing chronic stress.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the effect of the Boston Psychiatric Rehabilitation (PR) Approach on attainment of personal rehabilitation goals, social functioning, empowerment, needs for care, and quality of life in people with severe mental illness (SMI) in the Netherlands. Method: A 24-month, multicentre, randomized controlled trial was used to compare the results of PR to care as usual (CAU). Patients with SMI were randomly assigned by a central randomization centre to PR (n = 80) or CAU (n = 76). The primary outcome of goal attainment was assessed by independent raters blind to treatment allocation. Measures for secondary outcomes were change in work situation and independent living, the Personal Empowerment Scale, the Camberwell Assessment of Needs, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment. Effects were tested at 12 and 24 months. Data were analyzed according to intention to treat. Covariates were psychiatric centre, psychopathology, number of care contacts, and educational level of the professionals involved. Results: The rate of goal attainment was substantially higher in PR at 24 months (adjusted risk difference: 21%, 95% CI 4% to 38%; number needed to treat [NNT] = 5). The approach was also more effective in the area of societal participation (PR: 21% adjusted increase, CAU: 0% adjusted increase; NNT = 5) but not in the other secondary outcome measures. Conclusions: The results suggest that PR is effective in supporting patients with SMI to reach self-formulated rehabilitation goals and in enhancing societal participation, although no effects were found on the measures of functioning, need for care, and quality of life.</ab>

        <ab>States are required to provide a public health screening for all newly arrived refugees in the United States. In 1997, a comprehensive program was created to include both a physical examination and a mental health screening. This article provides a complete description of the mental health screening process, including two illustrative cases, and reports information about the refugees who participated in the program. Ten percent of screened refugees were offered mental health referrals; of those, 37% followed up. Refugees who presented for treatment reported a higher number of symptoms upon screening compared with those who were offered referrals but did not follow up. Psychiatric evaluation confirmed that those who screened positive and presented for treatment were experiencing a high level of suffering and qualified for mental health diagnoses. The findings support inclusion of a mental health screening as part of the public health screening.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Psychological distress (PD) and depressive symptoms are commonly observed during menopausal transition. Studies suggest that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids may help alleviate depression. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare enriched ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) supplementation with placebo for the treatment of PD and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women. DESIGN: Women with moderate-to-severe PD (n = 120) were randomly assigned to receive 1.05 g E-EPA/d plus 0.15 g ethyl-docosahexaenoic acid/d (n = 59) or placebo (n = 61) for 8 wk. The main outcomes were 8-wk changes in PD scores [Psychological General Well-Being Schedule (PGWB)] and depressive scales [20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20) and the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21)]. RESULTS: At baseline, women with PD were mildly to moderately depressed, and 24% met the major depressive episode (MDE) criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. After 8 wk, outcomes improved in both groups, but no significant differences were noted between them. Stratification analyses for MDE diagnosis at baseline indicated that differences in adjusted 8-wk changes between the E-EPA group without MDE (n = 46) and the placebo group (n = 45) were 8.0 (95% CI: 0.6, 15.3; P = 0.034) for the PGWB, -0.2 (95% CI: -0.01, -0.4; P = 0.040) for the HSCL-D-20, and -2.7 (95% CI: -0.3, -5.1; P = 0.030) for the HAM-D-21. Differences in adjusted 8-wk changes between the E-EPA group with MDE (n = 13) and the placebo group (n = 16) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first trial of n-3 supplementation in the treatment of PD and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women. In women with PD without MDE at baseline, the 8-wk changes in PD and depressive scales improved significantly more with E-EPA than with placebo.

        <ab>Objective: To report acceptability, feasibility, and outcome data from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a brief intervention for caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer.Method: Eighty-one families were randomly assigned following collection of baseline data to Intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Recruitment and retention rates and progression through the protocol were tracked. Measures of state anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms served as outcomes.Results: Difficulties enrolling participants included a high percentage of newly diagnosed families failing to meet inclusion criteria (40%) and an unexpectedly low participation rate (23%). However, movement through the protocol was generally completed in a timely manner and those completing the intervention provided positive feedback. Outcome data showed no significant differences between the arms of the RCT.Conclusions: There are many challenges inherent in conducting a RCT shortly after cancer diagnosis. Consideration of alternative research designs and optimal timing for interventions are essential next steps.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) may be the first manifestation of an underlying neurocognitive disorder. We undertook a review to provide an update on the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS that occur in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and just before the onset of MCI. We discuss common clinical presentations and the implications for diagnosis and care.Method: The authors conducted a selective review of the literature regarding the emergence of NPS in late life, before and after the onset of MCI. We discuss recent publications that explore the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS in the earliest clinical stages of these disorders.Results: NPS have been reported in 35% to 85% of adults with MCI and also occur in advance of cognitive decline. The occurrence of NPS for the first time in later life should increase suspicion for an underlying neurocognitive disorder. The presenting symptom may provide a clue regarding the etiology of the underlying disorder, and the co-occurrence of NPS may herald a more accelerated cognitive decline.Conclusions: NPS are prevalent in the early clinical stages of neurocognitive disorders and can serve as both useful diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Recognition of NPS as early manifestations of neurocognitive disorders will become increasingly important as we move towards preventative strategies and disease-modifying treatments that may be most effective when deployed in the earliest stages of disease.</ab>
        <ab>Objectif : Les symptômes neuropsychiatriques (SNP) peuvent être la première manifestation d’un trouble neurocognitif sous-jacent. Nous avons entrepris une revue pour offrir une mise à jour de l’épidémiologie et des mécanismes étiologiques des SNP qui surviennent dans la déficience cognitive bénigne (DCB) et immédiatement avant le début de la DCB. Nous discutons des présentations cliniques communes et des implications pour le diagnostic et les soins. Méthode : Les auteurs ont mené une revue sélective de la littérature au sujet de l’apparition des SNP en fin de vie, avant et après le début de la DCB. Nous discutons des publications récentes qui explorent l’épidémiologie et les mécanismes étiologiques des SNP dans les premiers stades cliniques de ces troubles. Résultats : Les SNP ont été signalés chez 35 à 85% des adultes souffrant de DCB et surviennent également préalablement au déclin cognitif. L’occurrence des SNP pour la premiére fois en fin de vie devrait faire soupçonner davantage la présence d’un trouble neurocognitif sous-jacent. Le symptôme présent peut fournir un indice de l’étiologie du trouble sous-jacent et la cooccurrence des SNP peut annoncer un déclin cognitif plus accélére´. Conclusions : Les SNP sont prévalents dans les premiers stades cliniques des troubles neurocognitifs et peuvent servir d’indicateurs utiles du diagnostic et du pronostic. Reconnaître les SNP comme étant des manifestations précoces des troubles neurocognitifs deviendra de plus en plus important puisque nous nous dirigeons vers des stratégies préventives et des traitements modifiant l’évolution de la maladie qui seront le plus efficaces lorsqu’ils seront appliqués aux premiers stades de la maladie.</ab>

        <ab>Psychiatric disorders are now the most common reason for long-term sickness absence. The associated loss in productivity and the payment of disability benefits places a substantial burden on the economies of many developed countries. The occupational dysfunction associated with psychiatric disorders can also lead to poverty and social isolation. As a result the area of work and psychiatric disorders is a high priority for policymakers. There are two main agendas: for many researchers and clinicians the focus is on the need to overcome stigma and ensure people with severe psychiatric disorders have meaningful work; however the public health agenda predominantly relates to the more common disorders such as depression and anxiety, which contribute a greater burden of disability benefits and pensions. In this review we attempt to address this second agenda. The relatively sparse evidence available reveals a complex field with significant interplay between medical, psychological social and cultural factors. Sick leave can be a 'process' as well as an 'event'. In this review we propose a staged model where different risk and protective factors contribute to the onset of psychiatric disorders in the working population, the onset of short-term sickness absence, and the transition from short- to long-term absence. We also examine strategies to manage psychiatric disorder in the workforce with a view towards returning the employee to work. Our aim in this review is to highlight the complexity of the area, to stimulate debate and to identify important gaps in knowledge where further research might benefit both patients and wider society.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Women with major depressive disorder (MDD) and childhood sexual abuse histories have an increased risk for suicidal behaviours, but it is unclear whether specific abuse characteristics contribute to risk. We aimed to examine the contributions of abuse characteristics to lifetime history of suicide attempts and multiple suicide attempts, independent of posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder. Method: Women with MDD and sexual abuse histories (n = 106) were assessed regarding sexual abuse characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, and suicide attempts. Results: In multivariate logistic regressions, the odds of having multiple suicide attempts increased 12.27-fold when childhood sexual abuse was perpetrated by a parent figure or a parent, compared with a nonparent. Conclusions: Parental perpetration of sexual abuse increases the likelihood of multiple suicide attempts among women outpatients. The relationship of the perpetrator to the abused woman is important in suicide risk evaluation and treatment planning. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT00843700.</ab>

        <ab>Common mental disorders pose tremendous health and social burdens in the poorest countries. This Open Forum describes a planning framework to advance effective, sustainable design and implementation of mental health services in these settings. It builds on research in treatment dissemination and on the authors' experience in several initiatives-including the Millennium Villages Project in sub-Saharan Africa and the Partners In Health system in Haiti (Zanmi Lasante). The authors describe a 'pyramid of care' approach that specifies five key skill packages to address common mental disorders in low-resource settings and five implementation rules: assess context first; identify priority care pathways and map them across skill packages; specify decision supports, supervision, and triage rules; use quality improvement practices; and plan for sustainability and capacity building. The framework addresses the need for a shared vocabulary and a set of tools to coordinate and compare efforts to scale-up mental health treatment across diverse settings.

        <ab>Objective: The authors examined racial differences in response rates to an intervention involving collaborative care and usual care among 360 veterans treated for depression at Department of Veterans Affairs community-based primary care clinics.Methods: Individuals who screened positive for depression were assigned randomly to usual care (N=200) or to a collaborative care intervention (N=160) that provided phone contact when necessary with a registered nurse and clinical pharmacist to address issues related to compliance with medication and side effect management as well as supervision by a psychiatrist through video chats with the collaborative care team. Data about patients' characteristics, treatment history, and response to treatment were collected by telephone at baseline and after six months.Results: Seventy-five percent (N=272) of the veterans were Caucasian, and 25% (N=88) belonged to a minority group, including 18% (N=64) who were African American, 3% (N=11) who were Native American, and 3.6% (N=13) who were of other minority groups. There were no significant differences between response rates between the Caucasian and minority group to usual care (18% and 8%, respectively), but the minority group had a higher response rate (42%) than Caucasians (19%) to the intervention (χ²=8.2, df=1, p=.004). Regression analysis indicated that the interaction of minority group status by intervention significantly predicted response (odds ratio [OR]=6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.6-24.5, p=.009), even after adjustment for other factors associated with minority status (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.5-24.3, p=.01).Conclusions: Racial disparities in depression care may be ameliorated through collaborative care programs.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Despite the negative effects of depression in Parkinson's disease, there is currently no evidence-based standard of care. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of individually administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relative to clinical monitoring (with no new treatment), for depression in this medical population.Method: Eighty depressed (based on DSM-IV criteria) patients with Parkinson's disease participated in a randomized, controlled trial of CBT relative to clinical monitoring (1:1 ratio) in an academic medical center from April 2007 to July 2010. All patients continued to maintain stable medication regimens under the care of their personal physicians. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score was the primary outcome. CBT was modified to meet the unique needs of the Parkinson's disease population and provided for 10 weeks. Assessments were completed by blind raters at baseline and 5 (midpoint), 10 (end of treatment), and 14 weeks (follow-up evaluation) postrandomization.Results: The CBT group reported greater reductions in depression (change in HAM-D score) than the clinical monitoring group. At week 10, the mean HAM-D score change was 7.35 for CBT relative to 0.05 for clinical monitoring. CBT was also superior to clinical monitoring on several secondary outcomes (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory scores, anxiety, quality of life, coping, Parkinson's disease symptom ratings). There were more treatment responders in the CBT group than the clinical monitoring group (56% versus 8%, respectively).Conclusions: CBT may be a viable approach for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease. Further research is needed to replicate and extend these findings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), a structured and time-limited therapy, has been studied in many controlled trials. Numerous practice guidelines have recommended IPT as a treatment of choice for unipolar depressive disorders. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to integrate research on the effects of IPT.Method: The authors searched bibliographical databases for randomized controlled trials comparing IPT with no treatment, usual care, other psychological treatments, and pharmacotherapy as well as studies comparing combination treatment using pharmacotherapy and IPT. Maintenance studies were also included.Results: Thirty-eight studies including 4,356 patients met all inclusion criteria. The overall effect size (Cohen's d) of the 16 studies that compared IPT and a control group was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.36 to 0.90), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 2.91. Ten studies comparing IPT and other psychological treatments showed a nonsignificant differential effect size of 0.04 (95% CI=-0.14 to 0.21; number needed to treat=45.45) favoring IPT. Pharmacotherapy (after removal of one outlier) was more effective than IPT (d=-0.19, 95% CI=-0.38 to -0.01; number needed to treat=9.43), and combination treatment was not more effective than IPT alone, although the paucity of studies precluded drawing definite conclusions. Combination maintenance treatment with pharmacotherapy and IPT was more effective in preventing relapse than pharmacotherapy alone (odds ratio=0.37; 95% CI=0.19 to 0.73; number needed to treat=7.63).Conclusions: There is no doubt that IPT efficaciously treats depression, both as an independent treatment and in combination with pharmacotherapy. IPT deserves its place in treatment guidelines as one of the most empirically validated treatments for depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Many depressed women seen in community mental health centers (CMHCs) have histories of childhood sexual abuse and are economically disadvantaged. Randomized trials are needed to test the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions in this population and setting. This study compared interpersonal psychotherapy with usual care psychotherapy among women in a CMHC.Methods: Among 1,100 women seeking treatment in a CMHC, 230 (21%) had major depression and histories of childhood sexual abuse. Seventy women with major depression and sexual abuse before age 18 were randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy (N=37) or usual care psychotherapy (N=33). Staff clinicians provided all treatments. Participants were assessed at study entry and at ten, 24, and 36 weeks after random assignment. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine change over time.Results: Compared with women assigned to usual care, women who received interpersonal psychotherapy had greater reductions in depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale, p=.05, d=.34; Beck Depression Inventory-II, p=.01, d=.29), posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (p=.04, d=.76), and shame (p=.002, d=.38). Interpersonal psychotherapy and usual care yielded comparable improvements in social and mental health-related functioning.Conclusions: Interpersonal psychotherapy compared favorably to usual care psychotherapy in a CMHC in improving psychiatric symptoms and reducing shame among sexually abused women. However, there is a critical need for continued research to develop more effective treatments for the social and psychiatric sequelae of interpersonal trauma and socioeconomic disadvantage.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Inadequate physician training and involvement in addictions treatment are barriers to integrating mental health and addiction services in public behavioral health care. The authors designed and implemented the Dual Diagnosis Physician-infrastructure Assessment Tool (DDPAT) to quantify statewide dimensions of this workforce problem.Methods: The DDPAT examined institutional dual diagnosis capability and physician workforce, training backgrounds, and clinical roles across Indiana's 30 community mental health centers (CMHCs), six psychiatric hospitals, and 13 addiction treatment centers.Results: All treatment centers and 75% of physicians responded. Sixty-nine percent of all treatment centers and 97% of CMHCs reported dual diagnosis capability. However, 29% of physicians treated both mental illness and addictions, and only 8% had certification in an addiction specialty. Overall workforce shortages, particularly of younger psychiatrists, contextualized these findings.Conclusions: The DDPAT identified multiple deficiencies in the physician workforce with respect to dual diagnosis and addictions care in Indiana. The DDPAT may be useful for characterizing similar trends in other states.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE Comorbid depression is common in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, adversely affecting quality of life, diabetes outcomes, and mortality. Depression can be effectively treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The Internet is a new and attractive method for delivering CBT intervention on a large scale at relatively low costs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Web-based CBT for depression treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with minimal guidance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands in 255 adult diabetic patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Primary outcomes were depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycemic control. Assessments were at baseline, after treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up. RESULTS The Web-based CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms by intention-to-treat analyses (P = 0.04, d = 0.29; clinical improvement 41% vs. 24% P &lt; 0.001) and by per-protocol analyses (P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.70; clinical improvement, 56% vs. 24% P &lt; 0.001). The intervention reduced diabetes-specific emotional distress (P = 0.03) but had no beneficial effect on glycemic control (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Web-based CBT depression treatment is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, the intervention reduces diabetes-specific emotional distress in depressed patients.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: There are growing concerns about the mental health status of returning veterans from the recent conflicts in Iraq (Operation Iraq Freedom [OIF]) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF]) and about retention in mental health treatment of veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study obtained data from veterans who had a new diagnosis of PTSD from fiscal year (FY) 2004 to FY 2007 and determined whether retention in PTSD treatment and the number of mental health visits were comparable among OIF-OEF veterans and veterans from other service eras.Methods: Data from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense were combined to identify veterans who were newly diagnosed as having PTSD (N=204,184) and their service era. Survival analysis assessed dropout from mental health treatment within one year from initial diagnosis, and Poisson regression assessed the association between war era and number of mental health visits.Results: Although a smaller proportion of OIF-OEF veterans than Vietnam-era veterans remained in treatment for more than one year (37.6% versus 46.0%), when the analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics and comorbid diagnoses, OIF-OEF veterans were less likely than Vietnam-era veterans to discontinue psychiatric treatment for PTSD within one year. OIF-OEF veterans attended fewer mental health visits than Vietnam-era veterans did (8.15 versus 13.37). However, multivariate analysis indicated that, after the analyses adjusted for confounding factors, OIF-OEF veterans had significantly more visits than Vietnam-era veterans associated with PTSD treatment.Conclusions: Retention and numbers of visits were found to be lower among OIF-OEF veterans primarily as a function of age and comorbid conditions and not as a function of the particular war era. Interventions should be designed to target specific barriers to care that may interfere with continued engagement in mental health services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examines relationships between affect and sleep in youth with affective disorders using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).Methods: Participants included 94 youth, ages 8-16 (M = 11.73, 53% female) years with an anxiety disorder only (n = 23), primary major depressive disorder (with and without a secondary anxiety diagnoses; n = 42), and healthy controls (n = 29). A cell phone EMA protocol assessed affect and actigraphy measured sleep.Results: The patterns of bidirectional relationships between affect and sleep differed across diagnostic groups. Higher daytime positive affect and positive to negative affect ratios were associated with more time in bed during the subsequent night for youth with primary depression and less time in bed for youth with anxiety only. More time asleep was associated with more positive affect for both diagnostic groups the following day.Conclusions: This relationship may be important to consider in the treatment of youth affective disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Aims: To assess the relationships between trait anger (T-Anger) and anger expression styles and emotional states—suicide probability, depression, state and trait anxiety and self-esteem—in alcohol-dependent inpatients. Methods: The patients included in this study were 142 male inpatients with alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria. The Suicide Probability Scale, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scales, and the T-Anger and Anger Expressions Scales were used for the assessment of the emotional states of the patients. Pearson correlation, analysis of variance and linear regression were used in the statistical analysis. Results: There were significant correlations between suicide probability, depression, state and the trait anxiety, and the T-Anger and all of the anger expression subscales. The presence of high probability for suicide was related to a high level of T-Anger, Anger-out and Anger-in. Finally, a low level of hopelessness was associated with a high level of T-Anger, and a high level of the trait anxiety was associated with a low level of the Anger Control (AEX-Con). Conclusion: The findings indicated that suicide probability, hopelessness and trait anxiety predict T-Anger levels and anger expression styles. Therefore, anxiety, hopelessness and suicide probability must be considered as risk for anger and anger expressions in alcohol-dependent patients. Furthermore, alcohol treatment programmes should attach importance to anger management and AEX-Con training.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To compare the health costs of groups with and without psychiatric diagnoses (PDs) using 9 years of physician billing data.Methods: A dataset containing registration data for all patients receiving public mental health service was constructed and subsequently matched, on age and sex, in a final patient to comparison patient ratio of 1:8, with health care users who did not receive treatment in the mental health system. Three groups emerged: a patient PD group-patients with psychiatric disorders treated in public mental health care (n = 76 677); a comparison patient PD group-comparison patients with PDs treated in physicians only (n = 277 627); and a patient- comparison patient non-PD group-patients (treated in specialized publicly funded care or by their physician) without PDs (n = 329 177). Examining over 42 million billing records for all of these patients, we compared the average number of visits and the average health only (nonpsychiatric) billing cost per each patient during the 9-year study period across the groups.Results: Among all health care users in the data, the health costs (Total Costs - Mental Health Costs) were greater on average for the patients with PD group ($3437) and the comparison patient PD group ($3265), compared with patient-comparison patient non-PD group ($1345). Forty-six percent of the comparison sample had a PD.Conclusions: Having a mental health problem is related to greater health-related expenditures. This has important policy implications on how mental health resources are constructed and rationed within the health care system.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The aim of this study was to identify components of cultural competence in mental health programs developed for cultural groups by community and mental health professionals from these groups.Methods: Three programs were studied: a prevention program primarily serving African-American and Afro-Caribbean youth, a Latino adult acute inpatient unit, and a Chinese day treatment program in a community-based agency. Nine study-trained field researchers used a semistructured instrument that captures program genealogy, structure, processes, and cultural infusion. Program cultural elements were identified from field notes and from individual and group interviews of consumers and staff (N=104). A research-group consensus process with feedback from program staff was used to group elements by shared characteristics into the program components of cultural competence.Results: Components included communication competencies (with use of colloquialisms and accepted forms of address); staff in culturally acceptable roles; culturally framed trust building (such as pairing youths with mentors), stigma reduction, friendly milieus (such as serving culturally familiar foods and playing music popular with the culture), and services; and peer, family, and community involvement (including use of peer counselors and mentors, hosting parent weekends, and linking clients with senior center and community services).Conclusions: Incorporating these components into any program in which underserved cultural populations are seen is recommended for improving cultural competence.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent consequence of war experience, and specialized centers have been established in some war-affected areas to provide treatment. This study assessed treatment costs and outcomes in such centers in former Yugoslavia.Methods: An observational study was conducted in four specialized treatment centers (in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina). A total of 526 consecutive adult patients with war-related PTSD were assessed at the beginning of treatment, and 463 met inclusion criteria, including a diagnosis of PTSD on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS). For most patients seven years had elapsed between the traumatic experience and treatment at the specialized center. Service costs were also assessed. Outcomes measured at one year were the presence of a PTSD diagnosis and severity of symptoms as indicated by the CAPS score and subjective quality of life as measured by the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life.Results: At 12 months 380 (82%) patients were followed up, and 325 (86%) met criteria for PTSD. Symptoms and quality of life showed overall small but statistically significant improvements. Treatment costs for patients with and without PTSD at 12 months did not significantly differ (euro 307 and euro 284, respectively).Conclusions: The recovery rate among patients treated in specialized centers for war-related PTSD several years after the war was poor (14%), and symptom improvements were small. The recovery rate was not linked to service costs. Improving recovery rates might require different treatment methods or different service models.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Clinicians, advocates, and policy makers have presented mental illnesses as medical diseases in efforts to overcome low service use, poor adherence rates, and stigma. The authors examined the impact of this approach with a 10-year comparison of public endorsement of treatment and prejudice.Method: The authors analyzed responses to vignettes in the mental health modules of the 1996 and 2006 General Social Survey describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, major depression, and alcohol dependence to explore whether more of the public 1) embraces neurobiological understandings of mental illness; 2) endorses treatment from providers, including psychiatrists; and 3) reports community acceptance or rejection of people with these disorders. Multivariate analyses examined whether acceptance of neurobiological causes increased treatment support and lessened stigma.Results: In 2006, 67% of the public attributed major depression to neurobiological causes, compared with 54% in 1996. High proportions of respondents endorsed treatment, with general increases in the proportion endorsing treatment from doctors and specific increases in the proportions endorsing psychiatrists for treatment of alcohol dependence (from 61% in 1996 to 79% in 2006) and major depression (from 75% in 1996 to 85% in 2006). Social distance and perceived danger associated with people with these disorders did not decrease significantly. Holding a neurobiological conception of these disorders increased the likelihood of support for treatment but was generally unrelated to stigma. Where associated, the effect was to increase, not decrease, community rejection.Conclusions: More of the public embraces a neurobiological understanding of mental illness. This view translates into support for services but not into a decrease in stigma. Reconfiguring stigma reduction strategies may require providers and advocates to shift to an emphasis on competence and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Data from the 2006 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were examined for differences in the diagnosis and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders in rural and nonrural primary care settings.Methods: A sample of 11,658 patient visits to primary care providers was examined. ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify prevalence rates of depressive and anxiety disorder diagnoses. Treatments also were examined with criteria from American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines.Results: No rural-nonrural differences were found in diagnosis rates for depression (about 3%) or anxiety disorders (about 1.5%). Approximately 67% of individuals with a depressive disorder and 36% of those with an anxiety disorder received a recommended treatment during the visit, with no rural-nonrural differences.Conclusions: Although few differences were found between rural and nonrural primary care visits, these data support the notion that anxiety and depression are underdiagnosed in primary care. Moreover, recognition and diagnosis often do not translate into adequate treatment in both rural and nonrural primary care settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial is the largest open-label, pragmatic trial that has been undertaken to examine the treatment of major depressive disorder. At a cost of US$35 million over 6 years, STAR*D sought to test the effectiveness both of pharmacotherapy and of cognitive therapy, and to ascertain whether certain treatments are more optimal after one or more failed trials.Method: Patients (n = 2876) who presented to either a psychiatry or family practice setting seeking treatment for depression were included in the STAR*D analysis. In the 4 levels of STAR*D, patients were randomized to various treatment monotherapies, combinations, or augmentation strategies. The primary outcome was remission, based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes were response, as measured by clinician and patient self-report as well as various measures of patients' level of function and (or) quality of life.Results: Remission rates for treatment levels 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 were 18% to 30% and 7% to 25%, respectively. There was no difference in effectiveness between any treatments at any treatment level. Patients with longer index episodes, more concurrent psychiatric or general medical disorders, and (or) lower measures of baseline function were less likely to achieve remission. There were no major differences between outcomes in patients treated in primary, compared with specialist care, nor were there significant differences between depression rating scores obtained through clinician ratings, compared with self-report.Conclusion: Results of the STAR*D trial have shed important light on the effectiveness of current treatment strategies for patients with depression.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate outcomes of the Veterans Administration (VA) Afghan and Iraq Post-Deployment Screen for mental health symptoms. METHODS: Veterans Administration clinicians were encouraged to refer Iraq or Afghanistan veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or high-risk alcohol use to a VA mental health clinic. Multivariate methods were used to determine predictors of screening, the proportions who screened positive for particular mental health problems, and predictors of VA mental health clinic attendance. RESULTS: Among 750 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who were referred to a VA medical center and 5 associated community clinics, 338 underwent postdeployment screening; 233 (69%) screened positive for mental health problems. Having been seen in primary care (adjusted odd ratio [AOR]=13.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]=8.31, 21.3) and at a VA community clinic (AOR=3.28; 95% CI=2.03, 5.28) predicted screening. African American veterans were less likely to have been screened than were White veterans (AOR=0.45; 95% CI=0.22, 0.91). Of 233 veterans who screened positive, 170 (73%) completed a mental health follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of veterans met screening criteria for co-occurring mental health problems, suggesting that the VA screens may help overcome a 'don't ask, don't tell' climate that surrounds stigmatized mental illness. Based on data from 1 VA facility, VA postdeployment screening increases mental health clinic attendance among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is an integral part of the standard multiaxial psychiatric diagnostic system. The purpose of including the GAF in DSM-IV as a tool for axis V assessment is to enable clinicians to obtain information about global functioning to supplement existing data about symptoms and diagnoses and to help predict the allocation and outcomes of mental health treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the value of the GAF as part of a systemwide program for monitoring the allocation and outcomes of mental health care services. METHODS: Clinicians used the GAF to assess global functioning among 9,854 patients with psychiatric or substance use disorders, or both, who were already participating in an outcomes monitoring program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. A longitudinal prospective follow-up design was used. RESULTS: Patients' clinical diagnoses and symptoms were stronger predictors of GAF ratings than was their social or occupational functioning. GAF-rated impairment was associated with the provision of inpatient or residential care and outpatient psychiatric care, but patients with greater levels of impairment did not receive more treatment. GAF ratings were only minimally associated with treatment outcomes. No robust associations were found between GAF ratings and outcomes as assessed by clinician interview or by patients' self-report at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Including GAF ratings in a program for predicting the allocation and outcomes of mental health care is of questionable value. Research is needed to determine whether systematic training and ongoing validity checks would enhance the contribution of the GAF in monitoring service use and outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Involuntary outpatient treatment (IOT) is used as a tool to promote stability among people with psychotic disorders. The authors drew on quantitative research surveys, qualitative studies, and official guidelines to describe clinicians' views of IOT and reported practices in England, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Overall, clinicians prefer a scheme that is not overly bureaucratic and is clearly enforceable. Medication and supervision are core elements, but most clinicians prefer to mandate only treatment that works and that can be delivered with minimal coercion. The authors note that a consensus appears to be developing about the proper candidates and best practices for use of IOT.

        <ab>Objective: Although effective treatments exist, individuals with depressive and anxiety disorders can remain ill for years. Little is known regarding mental health status and treatment use in this population. This study provided national estimates of the prevalence of persistent depression and anxiety, as well as estimates of illness severity, treatment use, and quality of care in this population.Methods: Data were from a prospective, community-based cohort study of 1,642 adults with probable major depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder who were part of a U.S. probability sample. Telephone surveys were conducted during 1997-1998 and again an average of 32 months later. Surveys assessed diagnosis, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, medical conditions, suicidal ideation, insurance, medications, and treatment use.Results: At follow-up, 59% no longer met criteria for a disorder. The estimated national prevalence of a persistent depressive or anxiety disorder was 4.7%. In this subgroup, 87% had a chronic comorbid medical disorder. During the past year, 88% had seen a primary care practitioner, and 22% had seen a mental health specialist. Between baseline and follow-up, the percentage using appropriate medication increased (21% to 29%), but there was no significant change in use of appropriate counseling (23% to 19%). Only 12% were receiving both appropriate medication and counseling at follow-up. Treatment was less likely for men and people with less education. Suicidal ideation was present in 51% at follow-up.Conclusions: Strategies are needed to increase treatment use and intensity for people with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders. This may require improved access to mental health specialists.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Transference interpretation has remained a core ingredient in the psychodynamic tradition, despite limited empirical evidence for its effectiveness. In this study, the authors examined long-term effects of transference interpretations.Method: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial, dismantling design, plus follow-up evaluations 1 year and 3 years after treatment termination. One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, personality disorders, and interpersonal problems were referred to the study therapists. Patients were randomly assigned to receive weekly sessions of dynamic psychotherapy for 1 year with or without transference interpretations. Five full sessions from each therapy were rated in order to document treatment fidelity. Outcome variables were the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (clinician rated) and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (self-report). Rating on the Quality of Object Relations Scale (lifelong pattern) and presence of a personality disorder were postulated moderators of treatment effects. Change over time was assessed using linear mixed models.Results: Despite an absence of differential treatment efficacy, both treatments demonstrated significant improvement during treatment and also after treatment termination. However, patients with a lifelong pattern of poor object relations profited more from 1 year of therapy with transference interpretations than from therapy without transference interpretations. This effect was sustained throughout the 4-year study period.Conclusions: The goal of transference interpretation is sustained improvement of the patient's relationships outside of therapy. Transference interpretation seems to be especially important for patients with long-standing, more severe interpersonal problems.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: Psychosocial factors, including depression and vital exhaustion (VE) are associated with adverse outcome in coronary heart disease (CHD). Women with CHD are poor responders to psychosocial treatment and knowledge regarding which treatment modality works in them is limited. This randomized controlled clinical study evaluated the effect of a 1-year stress management program, aimed at reducing symptoms of depression and VE in CHD women. DESIGN: Patients were 247 women, &lt; or =75 years, recruited consecutively after a cardiac event and randomly assigned to either stress management (20 2-h sessions) and medical care by a cardiologist, or to obtaining usual health care as controls. Measurements at; baseline (6-8 weeks after randomization), 10 weeks (after 10 intervention sessions), 1 year (end of intervention) and 1-2 years follow-up. RESULTS: For VE, intention to treat analysis showed effects for time (P &lt; 0.001) and time x treatment interaction (P = 0.005), reflecting that both groups improved over time, and that the decrease of VE was more pronounced in the intervention group. However, the level of VE was higher in the intervention group than amongst controls at baseline, 22.7 vs. 19.4 (P = 0.036) but it did not differ later. The change in depressive symptoms did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: CHD women attending our program experienced a more pronounced decrease in VE than controls. However, as they had higher baseline levels, due to regression towards the mean we cannot attribute the decrease in VE to the intervention. Whether the program has long-term beneficial effects needs to be evaluated.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: There is evidence of disparities in depression treatment by factors such as age, race or ethnicity, and type of insurance. The purpose of this study was to assess whether observed disparities in treatment are due to differences in rates of treatment initiation or to differences in the quality of treatment once treatment has been initiated. METHODS: Logistic regression models using data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were estimated to assess the role of age, race or ethnicity, and type of insurance on rates of initiation of depression treatment for persons with self-reported depression and on rates of adequate treatment for those receiving treatment. RESULTS: African Americans and Latinos were significantly less likely to fill an antidepressant prescription than Caucasians. However, among patients who filled at least one prescription for an antidepressant, there were no racial or ethnic disparities in the probability of receiving an adequate trial of antidepressant medication. African Americans were more likely than Latinos and Caucasians to receive an adequate course of psychotherapy. Persons who did not have insurance coverage were less likely to initiate any depression treatment compared with those who did have insurance. However, if treatment was initiated, no difference in the probability of receiving adequate treatment was observed. Elderly persons were less likely to receive an adequate course of psychotherapy or counseling compared with younger persons. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in depression treatment appear to be due mainly to differences in rates of initiation of depression treatment, given that rates of adequate care generally did not differ once treatment was initiated.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether integrated mental health services or enhanced referral to specialty mental health clinics results in greater engagement in mental health/substance abuse services by older primary care patients. METHOD: This multisite randomized trial included 10 sites consisting of primary care and specialty mental health/substance abuse clinics. Primary care patients 65 years old or older (N=24,930) were screened. The final study group consisted of 2,022 patients (mean age=73.5 years; 26% female; 48% ethnic minority) with depression (N=1,390), anxiety (N=70), at-risk alcohol use (N=414), or dual diagnosis (N=148) who were randomly assigned to integrated care (mental health and substance abuse providers co-located in primary care; N=999) or enhanced referral to specialty mental health/substance abuse clinics (i.e., facilitated scheduling, transportation, payment; N=1,023). RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of patients engaged in treatment in the integrated model compared with 49% in the enhanced referral model. Integrated care was associated with more mental health and substance abuse visits per patient (mean=3.04) relative to enhanced referral (mean=1.91). Overall, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and higher mental distress. For depression, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and more severe depression. For at-risk alcohol users, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and more severe problem drinking. For all conditions, greater engagement was associated with closer proximity of mental health/substance abuse services to primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Older primary care patients are more likely to accept collaborative mental health treatment within primary care than in mental health/substance abuse clinics. These results suggest that integrated service arrangements improve access to mental health and substance abuse services for older adults who underuse these services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: About half of outpatients with major depressive disorder also have clinically meaningful levels of anxiety. The authors conducted a secondary data analysis to compare antidepressant treatment outcomes for patients with anxious and nonanxious major depression in Levels 1 and 2 of the STAR*D study.Method: A total of 2,876 adult outpatients with major depressive disorder, enrolled from 18 primary and 23 psychiatric care sites, received citalopram in Level 1 of STAR*D. In Level 2, a total of 1,292 patients who did not remit with or tolerate citalopram were randomly assigned either to switch to sustained-release bupropion (N=239), sertraline (N=238), or extended-release venlafaxine (N=250) or to continue taking citalopram and receive augmentation with sustained-release bupropion (N=279) or buspirone (N=286). Treatment could last up to 14 weeks in each level. Patients were designated as having anxious depression if their anxiety/somatization factor score from the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was 7 or higher at baseline. Rates of remission and response as well as times to remission and response were compared between patients with anxious depression and those with nonanxious depression.Results: In Level 1 of STAR*D, 53.2% of patients had anxious depression. Remission was significantly less likely and took longer to occur in these patients than in those with nonanxious depression. Ratings of side effect frequency, intensity, and burden, as well as the number of serious adverse events, were significantly greater in the anxious depression group. Similarly, in Level 2, patients with anxious depression fared significantly worse in both the switching and augmentation options.Conclusions: Anxious depression is associated with poorer acute outcomes than nonanxious depression following antidepressant treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Assertive community treatment teams have been criticized as being inherently coercive; however, base rates of control practices used by teams have not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to assess the rates at which different forms of agency control, such as involuntary outpatient commitment, representative payeeship, intensive medication monitoring, and agency-supervised housing, were used by assertive community treatment teams. Also examined were program, practitioner, and consumer correlates of agency control practices.Methods: A statewide survey was conducted of 23 assertive community treatment teams serving consumers with severe mental illness. Data were collected on both team attributes and practitioner attributes.Results: Extent of agency control was highly variable across sites. Intensive medication monitoring and representative payeeship were the most frequently used agency control practices. The strongest predictor of agency control was having a higher percentage of consumers on the caseload who were diagnosed as having a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Fidelity to the assertive community treatment model was not associated with agency control. However, lower quality of basic clinical services (for example, assessment and treatment planning) was associated with greater use of agency-supervised housing. Pessimistic practitioner attitudes were not significantly associated with agency control, but practitioner education was negatively associated with both representative payeeship and intensive medication monitoring.Conclusions: Assertive community treatment teams differed widely in their scope of agency control, and this variation was not associated with fidelity to the model. Consumer characteristics, such as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and active substance use, were most closely associated with agency control.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Active resistance is considered to be the 'normal' reaction during rape. However, studies have indicated that similar to animals, humans exposed to extreme threat may react with a state of involuntary, temporary motor inhibition known as tonic immobility. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of tonic immobility during rape and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.Material and Methods: Tonic immobility at the time of the assault was assessed using the Tonic Immobility Scale in 298 women who had visited the Emergency clinic for raped women within 1 month of a sexual assault. Information about the assault and the victim characteristics were taken from the structured clinical data files. After 6 months, 189 women were assessed regarding the development of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.Results: Of the 298 women, 70% reported significant tonic immobility and 48% reported extreme tonic immobility during the assault. Tonic immobility was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.50-5.03, p = 0.001) and severe depression (OR 3.42; 95% CI 1.51-7.72, p = 0.003) at 6 months. Further, previous trauma history (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48-3.77, p &lt; 0.001) and psychiatric treatment history (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.26-3.19, p = 0.003) were associated with the tonic immobility response.Conclusions: Tonic immobility during rape is a common reaction associated with subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. Knowledge of this reaction in sexual assault victims is important in legal matters and for healthcare follow up.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors examined the disruption of ongoing treatments among individuals with preexisting mental disorders and the failure to initiate treatment among individuals with new-onset mental disorders in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.Methods: English-speaking adult Katrina survivors (N=1,043) responded to a telephone survey administered between January and March of 2006. The survey assessed posthurricane treatment of emotional problems and barriers to treatment among respondents with preexisting mental disorders as well as those with new-onset disorders posthurricane.Results: Among respondents with preexisting mental disorders who reported using mental health services in the year before the hurricane, 22.9% experienced reduction in or termination of treatment after Katrina. Among those respondents without preexisting mental disorders who developed new-onset disorders after the hurricane, 18.5% received some form of treatment for emotional problems. Reasons for failing to continue treatment among preexisting cases primarily involved structural barriers to treatment, while reasons for failing to seek treatment among new-onset cases primarily involved low perceived need for treatment. The majority (64.5%) of respondents receiving treatment post-Katrina were treated by general medical providers and received medication but no psychotherapy. Treatment of new-onset cases was positively related to age and income, while continued treatment of preexisting cases was positively related to race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites) and having health insurance.Conclusions: Many Hurricane Katrina survivors with mental disorders experienced unmet treatment needs, including frequent disruptions of existing care and widespread failure to initiate treatment for new-onset disorders. Future disaster management plans should anticipate both types of treatment needs.</ab>

        <ab>The National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine have called for making the healthy mental, emotional, and behavioral development of young people a national priority. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in the US Department of Health and Human Services is uniquely positioned to help develop national mental health policies that promote mental health and prevent mental illnesses. In this article I describe the role of mental health in overall health, I make the case for a public health approach to mental health promotion and mental illness prevention, and I outline a strategy to promote individual, family, and community resilience. I also describe how SAMHSA works to achieve these goals. Ultimately, true health reform will not succeed without a comprehensive, committed focus on the mental health needs of all Americans.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Family and twin studies indicate substantial overlap of genetic influences on psychotic and mood disorders. Linkage and candidate gene studies have also suggested overlap across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study was to apply genomewide association study (GWAS) analysis to address the specificity of genetic effects on these disorders.Method: The authors combined GWAS data from three large effectiveness studies of schizophrenia (CATIE, genotyped: N=741), bipolar disorder (STEP-BD, geno-typed: N=1,575), and major depressive disorder (STAR*D, genotyped: N=1,938) as well as from psychiatrically screened control subjects (NIMH-Genetics Repository: N=1,204). A two-stage analytic procedure involving an omnibus test of allele frequency differences among case and control groups was applied, followed by a model selection step to identify the best-fitting model of allelic effects across disorders.Results: The strongest result was seen for a single nucleotide polymorphism near the adrenomedullin (ADM) gene (rs6484218), with the best-fitting model indicating that the effect was specific to bipolar II disorder. Findings also revealed evidence suggesting that several genes may have effects that transcend clinical diagnostic boundaries, including variants in NPAS3 that showed pleiotropic effects across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.Conclusions: This study provides the first genomewide significant evidence implicating variants near the ADM gene on chromosome 11p15 in psychopathology, with effects that appear to be specific to bipolar II disorder. Although genomewide significant evidence of cross-disorder effects was not detected, the results provide evidence that there are both pleiotropic and disorder-specific effects on major mental illness and illustrate an approach to dissecting the genetic basis of mood and psychotic disorders that can inform future large-scale cross-disorder GWAS analyses.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To document the remission and persistence of psychiatric disorders in Quebec's older adult population.Method: Data came from the Enquête sur la santé des aînés (ESA) study conducted in 2005-2008 using a representative sample (n = 2784) of community-dwelling older adults.Results: The ESA study results indicate that 12% of respondents met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depression, mania, anxiety disorders, or benzodiazepine drug dependency at the baseline interview. The results also indicate that the 12-month rate of patients with a persistent psychiatric condition was 19.4%. Sixty-seven percent of the patients in remission experienced a total recovery of their symptoms during the following year. The probability of presenting a persistent psychiatric condition or a partial remission after 1 year of follow-up, compared with those in total remission, did not vary according to sociodemographic characteristics. The results also showed that social support and the number of chronic health problems did not influence mental health at follow-up. However, results indicated that the use of health services (OR 7.4; 95% CI 3.72 to 14.55) and the change in the number of chronic health problems reported between baseline and the second interview (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.34) increased the probability of patients with prevalent disorders at Time 1 having persistent disorders at Time 2.Conclusion: Results suggest that a deterioration of physical health status was associated with the persistence of DSM-IV disorders in the elderly. These results also suggest that the use of mental health services is associated with severity of the mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Despite large numbers of mentally ill offenders in prisons, few studies of mentally ill offenders released from prison have been conducted. This study describes such a population of mentally ill offenders, the postrelease services they received, new offenses they committed, and factors associated with recidivism. METHODS: The authors reviewed electronic files and archived medical charts from the state corrections department to identify mentally ill offenders who left Washington state prisons in 1996 and 1997. Data on the individuals identified were then provided by several public agencies. Summary statistics were computed on subjects' characteristics and postrelease outcomes, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables that predicted convictions of new felonies and new crimes against persons. RESULTS: A total of 337 mental ill offenders were identified. Men and women differed with regard to offenses, diagnoses, rates of drug abuse, and use of mental health resources. Although most subjects (73 percent) received postrelease social or mental health services, few received clinically meaningful levels of service during the first year after release. Charges for new crimes or supervision violations were common (70 percent of subjects), but only 10 percent committed new felonies against persons, and 2 percent committed very serious crimes. Youth, frequency of past felonies, and variables such as misbehavior in prison were associated with new offenses. CONCLUSIONS: Whether community mental health treatment affects recidivism cannot be assessed fairly in the absence of higher levels of service during the first months after release. This study also identifies actuarial risk factors that predict new offenses at a level comparable to that of published risk assessment instruments. Commission of less serious offenses that usually precede felonies may provide an early warning of risk for new felonies and an opportunity for strategic intervention. The low rate of serious violence in the community by mentally ill offenders released from prison suggests that the risk of violence may be a weak and potentially counterproductive rationale for community support and mental health treatment of mentally ill offenders.</ab>

        <ab>An understanding of the strengths and limitations of automated data is valuable when using administrative or clinical databases to monitor and improve the quality of health care. This study discusses the feasibility and validity of using data electronically extracted from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) computer database (VistA) to monitor guideline performance for inpatient and outpatient treatment of schizophrenia. The authors also discuss preliminary results and their experience in applying these methods to monitor antipsychotic prescribing using the South Central VA Healthcare Network (SCVAHCN) Data Warehouse as a tool for quality improvement.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Change in three types of thought disorder as measured by Rorschach responses (contaminations, confabulations, and fabulized combinations) were assessed during intensive, long-term, psychodynamically oriented inpatient treatment. METHOD: Rorschach protocols for 90 seriously disturbed, treatment-resistant patients, 42 of whom were primarily preoccupied with primitive issues of interpersonal relatedness and used avoidant defenses (anaclitic patients) and 48 primarily preoccupied with primitive issues of self-definition and self-worth and used counteractive defenses (introjective patients), were evaluated at the beginning of treatment and, on average, 15 months into treatment. RESULTS: Change in anaclitic patients occurred primarily in more pathological forms of thought disorder (contaminations and confabulations) that express boundary disturbances; change in introjective patients occurred primarily in the less disturbed thought disorder (fabulized combinations) that expresses tendencies toward referential thinking. CONCLUSIONS: Seriously disturbed anaclitic and introjective patients expressed therapeutic progress in different but theoretically consistent ways.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to determine the relative efficacy of a psychotherapy program when combined with pharmacotherapy versus medication and clinical management in more severely depressed patients. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 124 hospitalized patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder that compared 5 weeks of interpersonal psychotherapy modified for depressed inpatients (15 individual and eight group sessions) plus pharmacotherapy with a regimen that involved medication plus intensive clinical management. The study included a prospective, naturalistic follow-up 3 and 12 months after acute treatment in 97 of 105 treatment completers. The 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: For the intent-to-treat cohort (N=124), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that patients treated with interpersonal psychotherapy had a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms at week 5. Response rates differed significantly between the two treatment conditions, favoring the group that received adjuvant interpersonal psychotherapy (70%) versus clinical management (51%). Remission rates also tended to be higher for patients in the interpersonal psychotherapy group (49% versus 34%). Patients who initially responded to interpersonal psychotherapy exhibited greater treatment gains at the 3-month follow-up evaluation, since only 3% of these subjects relapsed, compared with 25% of the clinical management subjects. Nine months later, this difference lost statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: An inpatient treatment program with both brief and intensive psychotherapy plus pharmacotherapy is superior to standard treatment. The results, which add to a growing body of evidence, suggest that this combination treatment may offer an advantage over treatment with medication and clinical management for more severely depressed patients.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether problem-solving therapy is an effective treatment in older patients with depression and executive dysfunction, a population likely to be resistant to antidepressant drugs.Method: Participants were adults age 60 and older with major depression and executive dysfunction. Problem-solving therapy was modified to be accessible to this population. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 weekly sessions of problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy and assessed at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12.Results: Of the 653 individuals referred for this study, 221 met selection criteria and were enrolled in the study. Reduction of depressive symptom severity was comparable for the two treatment groups during the first 6 weeks of treatment, but at weeks 9 and 12 the problem-solving therapy group had a greater reduction in symptom severity, a greater response rate, and a greater remission rate than the supportive therapy group (response rates at week 9: 47.1% and 29.3%; at week 12:56.7% and 34.0%; remission rates at week 9: 37.9% and 21.7%; at week 12: 45.6% and 27.8%). Problem-solving therapy yielded one additional response or remission over supportive therapy for every 4.4-5.6 patients by the end of the trial.Conclusions: These results suggest that problem-solving therapy is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and leading to treatment response and remission in a considerable number of older patients with major depression and executive dysfunction. The clinical value of this finding is that problem-solving therapy may be a treatment alternative in an older patient population likely to be resistant to pharmacotherapy.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Medication documentation is a critical aspect of quality patient care. The current study examined whether electronic medical records provide medication documentation that is more complete and faster to retrieve than traditional paper records.Method: This study involves a comparison of archived paper medical records to recent electronic medical records through chart review. A convenient sample of three large community mental health centers in Indiana was used. Medical charts for 180 patients with schizophrenia were rated on a checklist composed of 16 items that was adapted from a national project. Documentation that existed before implementation of the electronic medical record system was compared with that after implementation at each of the three centers. The main outcome measures were completeness and retrieval time of medication documentation.Results: Electronic medical records provided medication documentation that was more complete and faster to retrieve than paper records across all centers and within each center. On average, electronic medical records were 40% more complete and 20% faster to retrieve.Conclusion: Electronic records have potential to improve medication management for patients in mental health centers over traditional records. However, medication documentation for patients diagnosed with schizophrenia was found to be deficient in many areas, regardless of documentation format.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: One of the original principles of assertive community treatment (ACT) is that treatment should be time unlimited. Although termination is not uncommon in ACT, it has not been empirically studied. This study examined termination from a large program based on ACT.Methods: This study used national data from the Department of Veterans Affairs Mental Health Intensive Case Management program modeled on ACT to compare veteran characteristics, patterns of service delivery, and early clinical changes among veterans who terminated early (less than one year) and later (one to three years) with those of veterans had not terminated after three years. Bivariate comparisons and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with early and later termination.Results: Among 1,402 veterans enrolled in fiscal years (FY) 2002-2004, 16% terminated early, 26% terminated later, and 57% had not terminated after three years. Compared with those who had not terminated, those who terminated early showed higher suicidality scores, and participants who terminated early and those who terminated later were less likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and were more likely to have lower quality of life at entry. Stronger differentiating effects were observed for program participation. Those who terminated received less intensive services during the first six months of participation and had a weaker therapeutic alliance. Although participants who terminated early showed more violent behavior at follow-up than the other two groups, there were no other differences in early clinical changes.Conclusions: Rates of both early and later termination were substantial, and less active participation was a stronger predictor of termination than either patient characteristics or clinical changes. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was associated with continued treatment. Further research is needed to determine the impact of termination on longer-term outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Depression and anxiety are commonly associated with cognitive impairment. A systematic review of psychological treatments that appears in this issue of the Journal highlights the current paucity of good-quality data, but suggests these interventions hold promise. Given the increasing burden of dementia in our community, novel adequately powered randomised controlled trials in this area are urgently needed.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Families often do not receive the information that they need to care for their adult relatives with mental illness. This study examined the effectiveness of a family-led education intervention, the Journey of Hope, in improving participants' knowledge about mental illness and its treatment and decreasing their information needs.Methods: A total of 462 family members of adults with mental illness in Louisiana participated in the study; 231 were randomly assigned to immediate receipt of the Journey of Hope course (intervention group), and 231 were randomly assigned to a nine-month waiting list for the course (control group). Participants completed in-person, structured interviews assessing their knowledge of mental illness and problem-solving skills and their information needs at study enrollment (baseline), three months postbaseline, and eight months postbaseline.Results: Random regression analyses indicate that at three and eight months postbaseline, compared with participants assigned to the control group, those in the intervention group reported greater knowledge gains (beta=.84, p&lt; or =.01) and fewer needs for information on coping with positive symptoms (beta=-.63, p&lt; or =.05), coping with negative symptoms (beta=-.80, p&lt; or =.001), problem management (beta=-1.00, p&lt; or =.001), basic facts about mental illness and its treatment (beta=-.73, p&lt; or =.01), and community resources (beta=-.07, p&lt; or =.05). These significant differences in knowledge and information needs were maintained over time and were significant even when controlling for participants' demographic characteristics and their relatives' clinical characteristics.Conclusions: Participation in family-led education interventions, such as the Journey of Hope, may provide families with the information they need to better cope with their relative's mental illness.</ab>

        <ab>The past four decades have witnessed a transformation in research on the benefits of psychological therapies. However, even though therapists highlight that negative and adverse effects are seen in day-to-day practice, research on the negative effects of psychotherapy is insufficient. Given the unrelenting popularity of therapies, the argument for examining the adverse effects of psychotherapy would seem to be compelling. Such a strategy would extend beyond supervision of individual therapists to the introduction of monitoring systems that allow for a more systematic examination of failed psychotherapy interventions (such as exist for medication prescribing). The starting point could be the development of a consensus on how to define, classify and assess psychotherapy side-effects, unwanted events, adverse reactions, etc. This would provide a conceptual framework for communication, monitoring and research. This approach should not be viewed as an attack on therapies: every branch of medicine learns from mistakes, the same must surely be true for psychological treatments.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Despite the high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans treated at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, rates of initiation of mental health treatment and persistence in treatment are unknown. This study examined outpatient treatment participation among veterans with a recent PTSD diagnosis and treatment differences according to the VA sector in which they received the diagnosis (PTSD specialty treatment program, general mental health clinic, and general medical clinic).Methods: Administrative data for 20,284 veterans who had received a diagnosis of PTSD at VA facilities were analyzed to determine rates of treatment initiation (any psychotropic prescription, an antidepressant prescription, behavioral counseling, and either a prescription or counseling) and maintenance of pharmacotherapy (at least four 30-day supplies), and counseling (at least eight visits) for the six months after diagnosis.Results: Approximately two-thirds of the sample initiated treatment: 50% received a psychotropic medication and 39% received some counseling; 64% received either medication or counseling. About half of those given medication (54%) received at least a four-month supply, and 24% of those given counseling had at least eight sessions. Overall, 33% received minimally adequate treatment. Initiation, type, and duration varied by treatment sector: receipt of a diagnosis in a PTSD specialty program or a mental health clinic conferred small but significant benefits over receipt in a general medical clinic.Conclusions: Greater availability of mental health specialty services, particularly PTSD services, may be needed to ensure that veterans receive minimally adequate treatment after a PTSD diagnosis.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To compare 12-month and lifetime service use for common mental disorders in 4 francophone subsamples using data from national mental health surveys in Canada, Quebec, France, and Belgium. This is the second article in a 2-part series comparing mental disorders and service use prevalence of French-speaking populations.Methods: Comparable World Mental Health-Composite International Diagnostic Interviews (WMH-CIDI) were administered to representative samples of adults (aged 18 years and older) in Canada during 2002 and in France and Belgium from 2001 to 2003. Two groups of francophone adults in Canada, in Quebec (n = 7571) and outside Quebec (n = 500), and respondents in Belgium (n = 389) and France (n = 1436) completed the French version of the population survey. Prevalence rates of common mental health service use were examined for major depressive episodes and specific anxiety disorders (that is, agoraphobia, social phobia, and panic disorder).Results: Overall, most francophones with mental disorders do not seek treatment. Canadians consulted more mental health professionals than their European counterparts, with the exception of psychiatrists.Conclusions: Patterns of service use are similar among francophone populations. Variations that exist may be accounted for by differences in health care resources, health care systems, and health insurance coverage.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined the rate and predictors of major depression six months after outpatient mental health admission.Methods: Assessments were conducted at admission and three and six months later among 166 participants. Antidepressant treatment adequacy and depression outcomes were assessed at follow-ups.Results: Predictors of major depression at six months included nonremission status at three months (odds ratio [OR]=3.56, p=.003), inadequacy of early pharmacotherapy (OR=2.73, p=.009), worse physical functioning measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (OR=.975, p&lt;.001), and being unmarried (OR=2.54, p=.031).Conclusions: The findings support the effects of baseline physical disability, marital status, early treatment adequacy, and early remission on the course of major depression. The identification of individuals who do not receive intensive pharmacotherapy or who have not recovered by three months may provide opportunities for interventions to optimize six-month outcomes and to prevent the development of a persistent depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD).Method: Participants (n = 29) diagnosed with comorbid OCD and MDD were randomized to receive standard CBT for OCD or integrated CBT that included an exclusive focus on treating MDD in the first phase of treatment and OCD in the second phase of treatment.Results: Both treatments resulted in statistically significant improvements in OCD and MDD symptoms. Treatment effects and recovery rates in the intent-to-treat sample were lower in both treatments, compared with past studies that excluded patients with MDD. However, among treatment completers, both treatments resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in OCD and MDD symptoms.Conclusions: CBT holds promise as an efficacious treatment for people with comorbid OCD and MDD. The high treatment dropout rate with comorbid patients suggests that additional treatment strategies are required to enhance retention and optimize clinical outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) evaluates the effectiveness of fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and their combination in adolescents with major depressive disorder. The authors report effectiveness outcomes across a 1-year naturalistic follow-up period. METHOD: The randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 13 academic and community sites in the United States. Stages I, II, and III consisted of 12, 6, and 18 weeks of acute, consolidation, and continuation treatment, respectively. Following discontinuation of TADS treatments at the end of stage III, stage IV consisted of 1 year of naturalistic follow-up. The participants were 327 subjects between the ages of 12 and 17 with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. No TADS treatment was provided during the follow-up period; treatment was available in the community. The primary dependent measures, rated by an independent evaluator blind to treatment status, were the total score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and the rate of response, defined as a rating of much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions improvement measure. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the eligible subjects participated in at least one stage IV assessment. The benefits seen at the end of active treatment (week 36) persisted during follow-up on all measures of depression and suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to earlier reports on short-term treatments, in which worsening after treatment is the rule, the longer treatment in the TADS was associated with persistent benefits over 1 year of naturalistic follow-up.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Assertive community treatment (ACT) is a key component of mental health care, but recent information on its cost-effectiveness is limited. This article provides a cost-effectiveness analysis of assertive community treatment and usual care from community mental health teams (CMHTs) in the United Kingdom.Methods: Participants who had difficulties engaging with community services were randomly assigned to ACT (N=127) or continued usual care from CMHTs (N= 124). Costs were measured at baseline and 18 months later and compared between the two groups. In the analysis, cost data were linked to information on satisfaction, which had been shown to be significantly higher with ACT.Results: Total follow-up costs over 18 months were higher for the ACT group by pounds sterling 4,031 ($6,369), but this was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval of - pounds sterling 2,592 to pounds sterling 10,690 [-$4,095 to $16,890]). A one-unit improvement in satisfaction was associated with extra costs in the ACT group of pounds sterling 473 ($747).Conclusions: The costs of ACT were not significantly different from usual care. ACT did, however, result in greater levels of client satisfaction and engagement with services and as such may be the preferred community treatment option for patients with long-term serious mental health problems.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors sought to identify predictors of self-harm adverse events in treatment-resistant, depressed adolescents during the first 12 weeks of treatment.Method: Depressed adolescents (N=334) who had not responded to a previous trial with an SSRI antidepressant were randomized to a switch to either another SSRI or venlafaxine, with or without cognitive behavior therapy. Self-harm events, i.e., suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury adverse events were assessed by spontaneous report for the first 181 participants, and by systematic weekly assessment for the last 153 participants.Results: Higher rates of suicidal (20.8% vs. 8.8%) and nonsuicidal self-injury (17.6% vs. 2.2%), but not serious adverse events (8.4% vs. 7.3%) were detected with systematic monitoring. Median time to a suicidal event was 3 weeks, predicted by high baseline suicidal ideation, family conflict, and drug and alcohol use. Median time to nonsuicidal self-injury was 2 weeks, predicted by previous history of nonsuicidal self-injury. While there were no main effects of treatment, venlafaxine treatment was associated with a higher rate of self-harm adverse events in those with higher suicidal ideation. Adjunctive use of benzodiazepines, while in a small number of participants (N=10) was associated with higher rate of both suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injury adverse events.Conclusions: Since predictors of suicidal adverse events also predict poor response to treatment, and many of these events occurred early in treatment, improving the speed of response to depression, by targeting of family conflict, suicidal ideation, and drug use may help to reduce their incidence. The relationship of venlafaxine and of benzodiazepines to self-harm events requires further study and clinical caution.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors examined whether initial assignment to receive placebo for 12 weeks followed by open active treatment as clinically indicated was associated with different levels of benefit and risk of harm across 36 weeks as compared with initial assignment to receive active treatments.Method: Adolescents with major depressive disorder (N=439) were randomly assigned to receive an initial 12 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), combination treatment with fluoxetine and CBT, or clinical management with placebo; those assigned to placebo received open active treatment as clinically indicated after 12 weeks of placebo. Assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for 36 weeks. The primary outcome measures were response and remission based on scores on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and the Clinical Global Impression improvement subscale.Results: At week 36, the response rate was 82% in the placebo/open group and 83% in the active treatment groups. The remission rate was 48% in the placebo/open group and 59% in the active treatment groups, a difference that approached statistical significance. Patients who responded to placebo generally retained their response. Those who did not respond to placebo subsequently responded to active treatment at the same rate as those initially assigned to active treatments. There were no differences between groups in rates of suicidal events, study retention, or symptom worsening.Conclusions: Remission rates at 9 months were lower in patients treated initially with placebo, but 3 months of placebo treatment was not associated with any harm or diminished response to subsequent treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors examined the association of treatment preferences with treatment initiation, adherence, and clinical outcome among nonsenior adult and senior primary care patients with depression.Methods: Sixty primary care participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression were randomly assigned to receive treatment congruent or incongruent with their primary stated preference. Participants received either 20 weeks of escitalopram, with monitoring by a care manager, or 12 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy followed by two monthly booster sessions. Adherence to treatment and depression severity were reassessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24.Results: Participants expressed stronger preferences for psychotherapy than for antidepressant medication. Preference strength was a more sensitive measure of outcome than was congruence versus incongruence of preference with the assigned treatment. Across age groups, preference strength was significantly associated with treatment initiation and 12-week adherence rate but not with depression severity or remission.Conclusions: A continuous measure of preference strength may be a more useful measure in clinical practice than preferences per se. Future research should focus on whether and how greater facilitation of the treatment decision-making process between patient and clinician influences clinical outcome.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Although racial and ethnic disparities in the use of child mental health services have been well documented, the causes of and solutions to these disparities are not clearly understood. This study examined the role of caregiver strain in the disproportionately low rates of services use among youths from racial or ethnic minority groups who had already had contact with public service systems.Methods: This cross-sectional study used secondary analysis of a stratified random sample of 1,370 youths from the Patterns of Youth Mental Health Care in Public Service Systems Study, who were involved with at least one of five public sectors of care. Caregiver strain and use of child mental health services in the past 12 months were assessed by the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire and the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents, respectively. A structural equation model that examined the mediating role of caregiver strain for use of child services among three racial and ethnic groups was evaluated for goodness of fit.Results: African-American caregivers reported lower levels of caregiver strain than did non-Hispanic white caregivers; Hispanic caregivers did not differ significantly from non-Hispanic white caregivers on reporting caregiver strain. Among African Americans, the effects of race on use of services were indirect, mediated through caregiver strain.Conclusions: Findings emphasize the importance of culturally influenced perceptions of caregiving practices and burden among caregivers of a child with emotional or behavioral problems. Intervention efforts to reduce disparities in use of services across racial or ethnic groups need to be informed by a better understanding of the causes of group differences in reporting caregiver strain and the relationship between reported caregiver strain and use of child mental health services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The aim of this investigation was to compare the efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive therapy against standard cognitive therapy and a control group without treatment for outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder.Method: Medication-free participants (N=45) with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to cognitive therapy (N=15), computer-assisted cognitive therapy (N=15), or a wait list (N=15). Both active treatments consisted of nine sessions over 8 weeks. Therapist time was reduced after the first visit for computer-assisted cognitive therapy, with 25-minute sessions rather than 50-minute sessions. Assessments were completed pretreatment, after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy, and 3 and 6 months posttreatment.Results: Computer-assisted cognitive therapy and standard cognitive therapy were superior to the wait list control group for treatment of depression and did not differ from each other on the primary outcome variables. Very large between-group effect sizes were observed. Improvement in depression for both computer-assisted cognitive therapy and standard cognitive therapy was maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations. Computer-assisted cognitive therapy had more robust effects, relative to being wait-listed, than standard cognitive therapy in reducing measures of cognitive distortion and in improving knowledge about cognitive therapy.Conclusions: A multimedia, computer-assisted form of cognitive therapy with reduced therapist contact was as efficacious as standard cognitive therapy. Computer-assisted therapy could decrease costs and improve access to cognitive therapy for depression.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors compared outcomes reported by patients who did or did not return for treatment after an initial psychotherapy visit.Methods: Members of a group health plan were surveyed about initial psychotherapy visits occurring between March and September 2010. The survey assessed satisfaction with care and therapeutic alliance during the visit and later clinical improvement.Results: Of the 2,666 members who returned surveys, 906 (34%) did not return for a second visit within 45 days. The distribution of satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, and self-rated improvement scores between patients who did and did not return differed significantly (p&lt;.001). Patients who did not return were more likely to report the most favorable and the least favorable outcomes.Conclusions: Failure to return after an initial psychotherapy visit can represent successful and satisfying treatment. Systematic outreach and outcome assessment are necessary to identify the patients who drop out of therapy after unsuccessful and unsatisfying treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined whether help seeking for mental problems was predicted by beliefs about mental illness and services and by family and social support.Methods: Singaporean adults (N= 2,801) were interviewed with the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and with questions on mental health status, beliefs about the curability of mental illness, embarrassment and stigma, ease of discussing mental problems, effectiveness and safety of treatment, and trust in professionals.Results: Although 10% of respondents had a depressive or anxiety disorder or combination, only 3% acknowledged having mental problems, 5% rated their mental health as fair or poor, and 6% sought help for their mental health problems. Help seeking was predicted by poor self-rated mental health and acknowledged mental illness but not by health beliefs and social support.Conclusions: Self-rated mental health status was predictive of help seeking, but other health beliefs and social support were neither strong nor robust predictors.</ab>

        <ab>Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for anxiety disorders. CBT treatments are based on disorder-specific protocols that have been developed to target individual anxiety disorders, despite that anxiety disorders frequently co-occur and are comorbid with depression. Given the high rates of diagnostic comorbidity, substantial overlap in dimensional symptom ratings, and extensive evidence that the mood and anxiety disorders share a common set of psychological and biological vulnerabilities, transdiagnostic CBT protocols have recently been developed to treat the commonalities among the mood and anxiety disorders. We conducted a selective review of empirical developments in the transdiagnostic CBT treatment of anxiety and depression (2008-2013). Preliminary evidence suggests that theoretically based transdiagnostic CBT approaches lead to large treatment effects on the primary anxiety disorder, considerable reduction of diagnostic comorbidity, and some preliminary effects regarding the impact on the putative, shared psychological mechanisms. However, the empirical literature remains tentative owing to relatively small samples, limited direct comparisons with disorder-specific CBT protocols, and the relative absence of the study of disorder-specific compared with shared mechanisms of action in treatment. We conclude with a treatment conceptualization of the new transdiagnostic interventions as complementary, rather than contradictory, to disorder-specific CBT.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on ways to ease depression. Moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking or jogging, can reduce stress and boost mood. In a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center study of 122 sedentary people whose depression failed to respond to antidepressants, 28 percent of participants reported improvements in three months after adding gentle walking routines to their treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The availability of mental health services in rural areas--particularly intensive services such as assertive community treatment (ACT)--has been of increasing concern and was the focus of this study. In recent decades the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has developed a national network of ACT-like programs called mental health intensive case management (MHICM), which have served veterans from diverse locations across the country, including urban and rural areas.Methods: This study used rural-urban commuting area codes and national VA administrative data to compare characteristics of veterans and patterns of MHICM service delivery among veterans with mental illness living in large urban, large rural, small rural, and isolated rural communities.Results: Among veterans enrolled in MHICM from FY 2000 to FY 2005 (N=5,221), 84% (N=4,373) resided in urban areas, 8% (N=421) in large cities, 6% (N=291) in small rural towns, and 3% (N=136) in isolated rural areas. MHICM participants who lived in rural areas had clinical problems broadly similar to those in urban areas, although more rural veterans were unemployed, disabled, received VA disability compensation, and had a payee or fiduciary. MHICM clients in smaller or isolated rural areas received slightly less frequent and less intensive contacts and less recovery-oriented services than those in large urban locations.Conclusions: These data highlight the need for intensive case management services in rural areas and note some challenges in providing them at the intensity and frequency observed in urban areas where travel distances and times are shorter.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To examine among adolescents (1) the prevalence of neck/shoulder, low back, and arm pain within different sociodemographic groups and (2) the association of neck/shoulder, low back, and arm pain with computer use, physical activity, depression, and stress. METHODS: A school-based questionnaire survey in 2002 and 2003 of neck/shoulder, low back, and arm pain, computer use, physical activity, depression, and stress. The survey was given to 3485 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years who attended secondary schools in Amsterdam, Netherlands. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of neck/shoulder, low back, and arm pain was 11.5%, 7.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. The prevalence of neck/shoulder pain was higher among girls and adolescents not living with both parents. The prevalence of low back pain also was higher among girls. Depressive symptoms were associated with neck/shoulder pain, low back pain, and arm pain. The stress experienced was associated with neck/shoulder pain and with low back pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens the findings that musculoskeletal pain is common among adolescents and is associated with depression and stress but not with computer use and physical activity.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Faced with a life-threatening illness, such as cancer, many patients develop stress symptoms, i.e. avoidance behaviour, intrusive thoughts and worry. Stress management interventions have proven to be effective; however, they are mostly performed in group settings and it is commonly breast cancer patients who are studied. We hereby present the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an individual stress-management intervention with a stepped-care approach in several cancer diagnoses.Method: Patients (≥ 18 years) with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer or testicle cancer and scheduled for adjuvant/curative oncology treatment, will consecutively be included in the study. In this prospective longitudinal intervention study with a stepped-care approach, patients will be randomized to control, treatment as usual, or an individual stress-management intervention in two steps. The first step is a low-intensity stress-management intervention, given to all patients randomized to intervention. Patients who continue to report stress symptoms after the first step will thereafter be given more intensive treatment at the second step of the programme. In the intervention patients will also be motivated to be physically active. Avoidance and intrusion are the primary outcomes. According to the power analyses, 300 patients are planned to be included in the study and will be followed for two years. Other outcomes are physical activity level, sleep duration and quality recorded objectively, and anxiety, depression, quality of life, fatigue, stress in daily living, and patient satisfaction assessed using valid and standardized psychometric tested questionnaires. Utilization of hospital services will be derived from the computerized patient administration systems used by the hospital. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated through a cost-utility analysis.Discussion: This RCT will provide empirical evidence of whether an individually administered stress-management programme in two steps can decrease stress as well as maintain or enhance patients' physical activity level, quality of life and psychological well-being. Further, this RCT, with a stepped-care approach, will provide knowledge regarding the cost-effectiveness of an individually administered stress-management programme whose aim is to help and support individual patients at the right level of care.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 01588262.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Poor quality of healthcare contributes to impaired health and excess mortality in individuals with severe mental disorders. The authors tested a population-based medical care management intervention designed to improve primary medical care in community mental health settings.Method: A total of 407 subjects with severe mental illness at an urban community mental health center were randomly assigned to either the medical care management intervention or usual care. For individuals in the intervention group, care managers provided communication and advocacy with medical providers, health education, and support in overcoming system-level fragmentation and barriers to primary medical care.Results: At a 12-month follow-up evaluation, the intervention group received an average of 58.7% of recommended preventive services compared with a rate of 21.8% in the usual care group. They also received a significantly higher proportion of evidence-based services for cardiometabolic conditions (34.9% versus 27.7%) and were more likely to have a primary care provider (71.2% versus 51.9%). The intervention group showed significant improvement on the SF-36 mental component summary (8.0% [versus a 1.1% decline in the usual care group]) and a nonsignificant improvement on the SF-36 physical component summary. Among subjects with available laboratory data, scores on the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Index were significantly better in the intervention group (6.9%) than the usual care group (9.8%).Conclusions: Medical care management was associated with significant improvements in the quality and outcomes of primary care. These findings suggest that care management is a promising approach for improving medical care for patients treated in community mental health settings.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Diverting potential arrestees with serious mental illnesses from the criminal justice system to mental health services has become a mainstay of public policy. Federal funding for local diversion and mental health court programs mandates that recipients of funds focus on 'nonviolent misdemeanants,' allowing more serious offenders to proceed through the justice system. This study explored the potential effects of applying such exclusions to a group of arrestees with serious psychiatric illnesses. METHODS: Data on charges in a cohort of mental health service recipients (N=13,816) were analyzed. RESULTS: Episodes of felony arrest, including some involving violence toward others, outnumbered misdemeanors. Under federal funding policies, many such cases would be processed through the justice system. CONCLUSIONS: Expanding inclusion criteria is necessary if diversion is to significantly affect incarceration rates among persons with mental illnesses. Policy makers should heed the accumulating evidence in this area in determining priorities for funding. (Psychiatric Services 62:1503-1505, 2011).</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the effectiveness of cognitive therapy and pharmacotherapy as second-step strategies for outpatients with major depressive disorder who had received inadequate benefit from an initial trial of citalopram. Cognitive therapy was compared with medication augmentation and switch strategies.METHOD: An equipoise-stratified randomization strategy was used to assign participants to either augmentation of citalopram with cognitive therapy (N=65) or medication (N=117; either sustained-release bupropion [N=56] or buspirone [N=61]) or switch to cognitive therapy (N=36) or another antidepressant (N=86; sertraline [N=27], sustained-release bupropion [N=28], or extended-release venlafaxine [N=31]). Treatment outcomes and the frequency of adverse events were compared.RESULTS: Less than one-third of participants consented to randomization strata that permitted comparison of cognitive therapy and pharmacotherapy. Among participants who were assigned to second-step treatment, those who received cognitive therapy (either alone or in combination with citalopram) had similar response and remission rates to those assigned to medication strategies. For those who continued on citalopram, medication augmentation resulted in significantly more rapid remission than augmentation with cognitive therapy. Among those who discontinued citalopram, there were no significant differences in outcome, although those who switched to a different antidepressant reported significantly more side effects than those who received cognitive therapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: After an unsatisfactory response to citalopram, patients who consented to random assignment to either cognitive therapy or alternative pharmacologic strategies had generally comparable outcomes. Pharmacologic augmentation was more rapidly effective than cognitive therapy augmentation of citalopram, whereas switching to cognitive therapy was better tolerated than switching to a different antidepressant.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Though central to experiences of mental health care for persons with serious mental illness, relationships with practitioners have been underemphasized in recent quality-of-care research. This qualitative study described concepts of good care in relationships with psychiatrists, therapists, and case managers from the perspectives of low-income persons with psychiatric disabilities. METHODS: In-person, semistructured interviews were conducted with 51 adult Medicaid enrollees with psychiatric disabilities and diagnoses of schizophrenia. Grounded theory techniques were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Eight categories representing service users' priorities for care in practitioner relationships resulted from the analysis: getting 'extra things,' looking for common ground, feeling known, the importance of talk, feeling like 'somebody,' practitioner availability, practitioner flexibility, and opportunities for input into treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and illness-centered formulations may miss much of what low-income service users with serious mental illness value in their relationships with practitioners. The opportunity to counter feelings of vulnerability and alienation with a sense of connection that is based on shared humanness may be a high priority for services for this group. Practitioner relationships that help service users feel cared about and connected to the social world address suffering in mental illness and are thus essential to the meaning of good care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patient and public involvement in research (PPIR) may improve trial recruitment rates, but it is unclear how. Where trials use PPIR to improve design and conduct, many do not communicate this clearly to potential participants. Better communication of PPIR might encourage patient enrolment, as trials may be perceived as more socially valid, relevant and trustworthy. We aimed to evaluate the impact on recruitment of directly advertising PPIR to potential trial participants.Methods: This is a cluster trial, embedded within a host trial ('EQUIP') recruiting service users diagnosed with severe mental illness. The intervention was informed by a systematic review, a qualitative study, social comparison theory and a stakeholder workshop including service users and carers. Adopting Participatory Design approaches, we co-designed the recruitment intervention with PPIR partners using a leaflet to advertise the PPIR in EQUIP and sent potential participants invitations with the leaflet (intervention group) or not (control group). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients enrolled in EQUIP. Secondary outcomes included the proportions of patients who positively responded to the trial invitation.Results: Thirty-four community mental health teams were randomised and 8182 service users invited. For the primary outcome, 4% of patients in the PPIR group were enrolled versus 5.3% of the control group. The intervention was not effective for improving recruitment rates (adjusted OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.07, p = 0.113). For the secondary outcome of positive response, the intervention was not effective, with 7.3% of potential participants in the intervention group responding positively versus 7.9% of the control group (adjusted OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.04, p = 0.082). We did not find a positive impact of directly advertising PPIR on any other outcomes.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest ever embedded trial to evaluate a recruitment or PPIR intervention. Advertising PPIR did not improve enrolment rates or any other outcome. It is possible that rather than advertising PPIR being the means to improve recruitment, PPIR may have an alternative impact on trials by making them more attractive, acceptable and patient-centred. We discuss potential reasons for our findings and implications for recruitment practice and research.Trial Registration Numbers: ISRCTN, ISRCTN16488358 . Registered on 14 May 2014.

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To assist in developing public policy about the feasibility of HIV prevention in community mental health settings, the cost of care was estimated for four groups of adults who were eligible to receive Medicaid: persons with serious mental illness and HIV infection or AIDS, persons with serious mental illness only, persons with HIV infection or AIDS only, and a control group without serious mental illness, HIV infection, or AIDS. METHODS: Claims records for adult participants in Medicaid fee-for-service systems in Philadelphia during 1996 (N=60,503) were used to identify diagnostic groups and to construct estimates of reimbursement costs by type of service for the year. The estimates included all outpatient and inpatient treatment costs per year per person and excluded pharmacy costs and the cost of nursing home care. Persons with severe mental illness, HIV infection, or AIDS had received those diagnoses between 1985 and 1996. RESULTS: Persons with comorbid serious mental illness and HIV infection or AIDS had the highest annual medical and behavioral health treatment expenditures (about $13,800 per person), followed by persons with HIV infection or AIDS only (annual expenditures of about $7,400 per person). Annual expenditures for persons with serious mental illness only were about $5,800 per person. The control group without serious mental illness, HIV infection, or AIDS had annual expenditures of about $1,800 per person. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high cost of treating persons with comorbid serious mental illness and HIV infection or AIDS, the integration of HIV prevention into ongoing case management for persons with serious mental illness who are at risk of infection may prove to be a cost-effective intervention strategy.</ab>

        <ab>This review describes Assertive community treatment (ACT), an integral component of the care of persons with severe mental illness. Drawing on research from North America, Australasia, and Britain, we summarize the current evidence base for ACT and examine the trends and issues that may affect practice. Strong evidence supports the fidelity standardization, efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of ACT models in psychiatry. Yet, significant methodological problems and issues affect implementation. The evidence indicates that the ACT model is one of the most effective systematic models for organizing clinical and functional interventions in psychiatry. Effective systems based on the ACT model meet more ACT fidelity criteria; are often noncoercive; do not rely on compulsory orders; may rely on a wider range of interventions than just medication adherence, including vocational and substance abuse rehabilitation; contain other evidence-based interventions and more mobile in vivo interventions; involve individual and team case management; may involve consumers as direct service providers; and have an interdisciplinary workforce and support structure within the team, providing some protection from work-related stress or burnout.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Despite its importance in the central nervous system as a precursor for acetylcholine and membrane phosphatidylcholine, the role of choline in mental illness has been little studied. OBJECTIVE: We examined the cross-sectional association between plasma choline concentrations and scores of anxiety and depression symptoms in a general population sample. DESIGN: We studied a subsample (n = 5918) of the Hordaland Health Study, including both sexes and 2 age groups of 46-49 and 70-74 y who had valid information on plasma choline concentrations and symptoms of anxiety and depression measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale--the latter 2 as continuous measures and dichotomized at a score &gt; or =8 for both subscales. RESULTS: The lowest choline quintile was significantly associated with high anxiety levels (odds ratio: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.69) in the fully adjusted (age group, sex, time since last meal, educational level, and smoking habits) logistic regression model. Also, the trend test in the anxiety model was significant (P = 0.007). In the equivalent fully adjusted linear regression model, a significant inverse association was found between choline quintiles and anxiety levels (standardized regression coefficient = -0.027, P = 0.045). We found no significant associations in the corresponding analyses of the relation between plasma choline and depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: In this large population-based study, choline concentrations were negatively associated with anxiety symptoms but not with depression symptoms. © 2009 American Society for Clinical Nutrition</ab>

        <ab>Background: Many patients with depressive disorders demonstrate resistance to psychological therapy. A frequent finding is hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis alterations. As cortisol is known to modulate cognitive processes, those patients may be less likely to profit from psychological therapy.Aims: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on cortisol as a predictor of psychological therapy response.Method: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched. Records were included if they looked at patients with any depressive disorder engaging in psychological therapy, with a pre-treatment cortisol and a post-treatment symptom measure.Results: Eight articles satisfied our selection criteria. The higher the cortisol levels before starting psychological therapy, the more symptoms patients with depression experienced at the end of treatment and/or the smaller their symptom change.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that patients with depression with elevated HPA functioning are less responsive to psychological therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This article reviews the evidence for the effectiveness of community-based services for rural areas, specifically assertive community treatment and intensive case management. Service delivery to persons with severe mental illness in rural areas is challenged by low population densities, limited services, and shortages of professionals.Methods: A comprehensive literature search identified six studies of rural assertive community treatment, only two of which were controlled studies, and four rural intensive case management studies, only one of which was a controlled study. Assertive community treatment would seem ideally suited to areas lacking services because of its self-contained multidisciplinary treatment team approach. However, rural programs have been forced to make several adaptations to the assertive community treatment model, including smaller teams, less comprehensive staff, and less intensive services. There is no published evidence that these adaptations are able to produce the same results as full-fidelity teams. Some believe that intensive case management may be an alternative to assertive community treatment in rural settings because intensive case management emphasizes individual caseloads, fewer staff, less intensive contacts, and brokered services.Conclusions: The evidence suggests that intensive case management programs are effective only in community settings where there is an ample supply of treatment and support services. To build the evidence base for the effectiveness of these models, much more attention needs to be focused on evaluating the current wave of assertive community treatment and intensive case management dissemination in rural areas.</ab>

        <ab>The Jail Inreach Project is a health care-based intensive case management "inreach" program that engages incarcerated persons from the homeless population who have behavioral health disorders (mental illness, substance use disorder, or both) in establishing a plan for specific postrelease services. The Jail Inreach Project aims to provide continuity of care and integrate this highly marginalized subpopulation of homeless persons into primary and behavioral health care systems by establishing patient-centered health homes. The use of integrated primary and behavioral health models in conjunction with provisions for immediate access to and continuity of care upon release is emerging as a best practice in combating the rapid cycling of this vulnerable population between streets and shelters, emergency centers, and the county jail. Preliminary results indicate that more than half of the persons referred to the program remained successfully linked with services postrelease, whereas slightly less than one-third who engaged in services while incarcerated did not retain linkage on release.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Quality improvement programs for depressed youths in primary care settings have been shown to improve 6-month clinical outcomes, but longer-term outcomes are unknown. The authors examined 6-, 12-, and 18-month outcomes of a primary care quality improvement intervention. METHOD: Primary care patients 13-21 years of age with current depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to a 6-month quality improvement intervention (N=211) or to treatment as usual enhanced with provider training (N=207). The quality improvement intervention featured expert leader teams to oversee implementation of the intervention; clinical care managers trained in cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression to support patient evaluation and treatment; and support for patient and provider choice of treatments. RESULTS: The quality improvement intervention, relative to enhanced treatment as usual, lowered the likelihood of severe depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score &gt; or =24) at 6 months; a similar trend at 18 months was not statistically significant. Path analyses revealed a significant indirect intervention effect on long-term depression due to the initial intervention improvement at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized effectiveness trial of a primary care quality improvement intervention for depressed youths, the main effect of the intervention on outcomes was to decrease the likelihood of severe depression at the 6-month outcome assessment. These early intervention-related improvements conferred additional long-term protection through a favorable shift in illness course through 12 and 18 months.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial (PROSPECT) evaluated the impact of a care management intervention on suicidal ideation and depression in older primary care patients. This is the first report of outcomes over a 2-year period.Method: Study participants were patients 60 years of age or older (N=599) with major or minor depression selected after screening 9,072 randomly identified patients of 20 primary care practices randomly assigned to provide either the PROSPECT intervention or usual care. The intervention consisted of services of 15 trained care managers, who offered algorithm-based recommendations to physicians and helped patients with treatment adherence over 24 months.Results: Compared with patients receiving usual care, those receiving the intervention had a higher likelihood of receiving antidepressants and/or psychotherapy (84.9%-89% versus 49%-62%) and had a 2.2 times greater decline in suicidal ideation over 24 months. Treatment response occurred earlier on average in the intervention group and increased from months 18 to 24, while no appreciable increase in treatment response occurred in the usual care group during the same period. Among patients with major depression, a greater number achieved remission in the intervention group than in the usual-care group at 4 months (26.6% versus 15.2%), 8 months (36% versus 22.5%), and 24 months (45.4% versus 31.5%). Patients with minor depression had favorable outcomes regardless of treatment assignment.Conclusions: Sustained collaborative care maintains high utilization of depression treatment, reduces suicidal ideation, and improves the outcomes of major depression over 2 years.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study examined the effectiveness of a three-month structured outpatient intervention developed for women with severe depression and childhood trauma that used brief psychodynamic psychotherapy by comparing it to standard treatment recommended in clinical guidelines issued by the Chilean Ministry of Health.Methods: Eighty-seven women who sought treatment from a public health service in Curicó, Chile, and who had severe depression and a history of childhood traumatic experiences were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention (N=44) or standard treatment (N=43). The participants were assessed at baseline and at three months (completion of the intervention) and six months with use of the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D); Lambert's Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2), which rates psychiatric symptoms, interpersonal relationships, and social role functioning; and the Post-traumatic Stress Treatment Outcome scale (PTO 8), which assesses symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. An intent-to-treat design was used with multiple analyses of variance.Results: At three months significant differences were found in favor of the intervention group in Ham-D scores (p&lt;.001) and OQ-45.2 scores (p&lt;.05). At six months a significantly greater proportion of the intervention group had indicators of remission as measured by the OQ-45.2 (39% versus 14%, p&lt;.05) and by the Ham-D (22% versus 5%, p&lt;.05). Scores on the PTO 8 indicated significant improvements in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at six months, although there were no significant differences between the groups.Conclusions: An outpatient intervention that screened for and focused on childhood traumas and that helped patients understand current psychosocial difficulties as a repetition of past traumas was effective in reducing psychiatric symptoms and improving interpersonal relationships and social role functioning among women with severe depression and a history of childhood trauma.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate whether parental worry about their children's health predicts usage of a pediatric Internet intervention for encopresis.Methods: Thirty-nine families with a child diagnosed with encopresis completed a national clinical trial of an Internet-based intervention for encopresis (www.ucanpooptoo.com). Parents rated worry about their children's health, encopresis severity, current parent treatment for depression, and parent comfort with the Internet. Usage indicators were collected while participants utilized the intervention.Results: Regression analyses showed that parents who reported higher baseline levels of worry about their children's health showed greater subsequent intervention use (beta =.52, p =.002), even after accounting for other plausible predictors. Exploratory analyses indicated that this effect may be stronger for families with younger children.Conclusions: Characteristics of individuals using Internet-based treatment programs, such as parental worry about their children's health, can influence intervention usage, and should be considered by developers of Internet interventions.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Longitudinal neuroimaging investigations of antidepressant treatment offer the opportunity to identify potential baseline biomarkers associated with poor outcome. METHODS: To explore the neural correlates of nonresponse to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or venlafaxine (VEN), we compared pretreatment (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography scans of participants with major depressive disorder responding to either 16 weeks of CBT (n = 7) or VEN treatment (n = 9) with treatment nonresponders (n = 8). RESULTS: Nonresponders to CBT or VEN, in contrast to responders, exhibited pretreatment hypermetabolism at the interface of the pregenual and subgenual cingulate cortices. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of our study include the small sample sizes and the absence of both arterial sampling to determine absolute glucose metabolism and high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging coregistration for region-of-interest analyses. CONCLUSION: Our current findings are consistent with those reported in previous studies of relative hyperactivity in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex in treatment-resistant populations.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to identify influences on the current clinical practices of a broad range of mental health providers as well as influences on their adoption and sustained use of new practices.Methods: U.S. and Canadian psychotherapists (N=2,607) completed a Web-based survey in which they rated factors that influence their clinical practice, including their adoption and sustained use of new treatments.Results: Empirical evidence had little influence on the practice of mental health providers. Significant mentors, books, training in graduate school, and informal discussions with colleagues were the most highly endorsed influences on current practice. The greatest influences on psychotherapists' willingness to learn a new treatment were its potential for integration with the therapy they were already providing and its endorsement by therapists they respected. Clinicians were more often willing to continue to use a new treatment when they were able to effectively and enjoyably conduct the therapy and when their clients liked the therapy and reported improvement.Conclusions: Implications for dissemination and sustained use of new psychotherapies by community psychotherapists are discussed. For example, evidence-based treatments may best be promoted through therapy courses and workshops, beginning with graduate studies; to ensure future use of new therapies, developers of training workshops should emphasize ways to integrate their approaches into clinicians' existing practices.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study investigated whether the trend of increasing rates of antidepressant use in the 1990s continued into 2000-2004. Antidepressant treatment rates were examined by age group and by the class of antidepressant in order to identify whether any observed trends were being driven by a particular age group of patients or class of medication.Methods: Secondary analysis was performed on data from the 2000-2004 Medical Panel Expenditure Surveys, a nationally representative survey of U.S. households, to examine trends in antidepressant use by age group and medication class in the total sample (N=166,435). Trends in the rates of antidepressant use among individuals with self-reported depression (N=10,959) and self-reported anxiety disorders without comorbid depression (N=6,899) were also examined.Results: Antidepressant use increased among all Americans, from 6.6% in 2000 to 8.1% in 2004 (p&lt;.001). Rates of antidepressant use by individuals with anxiety disorders without comorbid depression increased from 30.8% in 2000 to 39.0% in 2002, before declining to 33.2% in 2004. However, antidepressant use decreased among individuals with self-reported depression, from 63.1% in 2000 to 56.7% in 2004 (p&lt;.001). This downward trend in antidepressant use was largely driven by a decrease in use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, especially among children and middle-aged adults with depression. Rates of adequate antidepressant treatment (defined as receiving at least four antidepressant prescriptions at the minimum adequate daily dosage) peaked in 2002 (36.9%), and there was a significant decline by 2004 (31.7%) (p=.003).Conclusions: After years of increased use of antidepressant therapy to treat depression, a trend reversal in the beginning of the 21st century was observed, including decreasing rates of adequate antidepressant treatment. This downward trend preceded the black-box warnings included on antidepressant labels beginning in 2004.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) against a sleep hygiene education control therapy in patients with primary or comorbid insomnia. Design and Setting: Randomized, parallel-group, clinical trial conducted at a single Veterans Affairs medical center, with recruitment from March 2001 to June 2005. Participants: Eighty-one adults (n = 11 women; mean age, 54.2 years) with chronic primary (n = 40) or comorbid insomnia associated predominantly with mixed psychiatric disorders (n = 41). Interventions: Patients, screened via structured interviews and diagnostic polysomnography, were randomly assigned to receive CBT (sleep education, stimulus control, and time-in-bed restrictions; 20 patients with primary and 21 with comorbid insomnia), or sleep hygiene (SH: education about aspects of lifestyle and the bedroom environment that affect sleep; 20 patients with primary and 20 with comorbid insomnia). Outpatient treatment included 4 biweekly sessions with a posttreatment assessment and a follow-up conducted at 6 months. Measures and Results: Participants completed actigraphy and sleep diaries for 2 weeks prior to therapy, during a 2-week posttreatment assessment, and during 2 weeks at follow-up. They also completed questionnaires measuring global insomnia symptoms, general sleep quality, and sleep-disruptive beliefs before treatment, immediately following treatment, and at the follow-up time point. Consistent with previous studies, CBT outperformed sleep hygiene across several study outcome measures for the sample as a whole. Statistical analyses showed no significant 3-way interaction of treatment group, time, and insomnia type for any of the sleep or questionnaire measures, suggesting the benefits of CBT over sleep hygiene were comparable for patients with primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia. Moreover, only 1 of several indexes of clinically notable improvement suggested a significantly better response to CBT by patients with primary insomnia, as compared with those with comorbid insomnia. Conclusions: A fixed 4-session 'dose' of CBT produced similar benefits for patients with primary and those with comorbid insomnia across most measures examined. Thus, CBT appears to be a viable psychological insomnia therapy both for those with primary insomnia and for groups composed mainly of patients with insomnia and nonpsychotic psychiatric conditions.</ab>

        <ab>Context: Little is known about long-term quality of life (QoL) of survivors of pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate generic health-related QoL (HRQoL), fatigue, anxiety, and depression in these survivors compared with matched controls, and to evaluate thyroid cancer-specific HRQoL in survivors only.Design: Survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 2013 at age ≤18 years, were included. Exclusion criteria were a follow-up &lt;5 years, attained age &lt;18 years, or diagnosis of DTC as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). Controls were matched by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Survivors and controls were asked to complete 3 questionnaires [Short-Form 36 (HRQoL), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 20 (fatigue), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety/depression)]. Survivors completed a thyroid cancer-specific HRQoL questionnaire.Results: Sixty-seven survivors and 56 controls. Median age of survivors at evaluation was 34.2 years (range, 18.8 to 61.7). Median follow-up was 17.8 years (range, 5.0 to 44.7). On most QoL subscales, scores of survivors and controls did not differ significantly. However, survivors had more physical problems (P = 0.031), role limitations due to physical problems (P = 0.021), and mental fatigue (P = 0.016) than controls. Some thyroid cancer-specific complaints (e.g., sensory complaints and chilliness) were present in survivors. Unemployment and more extensive disease or treatment characteristics were most frequently associated with worse QoL.Conclusions: Overall, long-term QoL in survivors of pediatric DTC was normal. Survivors experienced mild impairment of QoL in some domains (physical problems, mental fatigue, and various thyroid cancer-specific complaints). Factors possibly affecting QoL need further exploration.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Assertive community treatment (ACT) reduces hospitalizations for persons with severe mental illness. However, not everyone who needs ACT receives it. Without empirical guidelines for ACT planning, communities are likely to underestimate or overestimate the number of teams they need; thus the capacity of the programs will not meet current needs. In this study, administrative data were used to develop empirical estimates for the number of required ACT teams. These estimates were then used to examine current conceptual guidelines for developing the number of ACT teams that communities need.Methods: Administrative data from a large, urban county were used to enumerate all persons with a severe mental illness who had three or more hospitalizations within one year (ACT eligible).Results: Fifty-one percent of persons with a severe mental illness were found to be eligible for ACT (743 of 1,453 persons). This figure represents 2.2 percent of the county's mental health users and .06 percent of its adult population.Conclusions: Communities should develop enough ACT teams to serve approximately 50 percent of their populations of persons with severe mental illness or roughly .06 percent of their adult populations.</ab>

        <ab>This column describes an innovative, government-sponsored, countrywide mental health reform focusing on rehabilitation and community integration of persons with serious mental illness, which was enacted into law in Israel in 2000. The reform was part of the country's efforts to shift the locus of treatment and care from psychiatric institutions to the community. The authors review preliminary evidence of the impact of reform and offer cautionary notes regarding the future direction of its implementation. The decade after the law's enactment saw an impressive increase in rehabilitation services, a significant reduction in the number of psychiatric beds, and major changes in government budget allocations. The authors examine factors that may endanger the viability of reform and discuss lessons to be learned from the Israeli experience.

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Maternal psychiatric illness is a potent risk factor for child psychiatric disorders, but little is known about rates of psychiatric diagnoses among mothers who bring their children to pediatric mental health clinics. This study investigated rates of psychiatric disorders among mothers of children presenting for psychiatric evaluation and examined the relationship between maternal diagnosis and child psychopathology. METHODS: Interviewers conducted structured diagnostic interviews with nonpsychotic, school-age children and their mothers (N=222) and collected self-report measures of symptoms, functioning, and social support. RESULTS: One-hundred-thirty-five participating mothers (61 percent) met DSM-IV criteria for a current axis I disorder, most commonly depression (35 percent) and anxiety (42 percent). Children of mothers with a diagnosis met criteria for significantly more diagnoses on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children, Present and Lifetime version and had significantly higher scores on measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms than children of mothers without a diagnosis. Two-thirds of mothers with a diagnosis were not receiving psychiatric treatment. CONCLUSIONS: More than half the mothers who brought their children for psychiatric treatment were themselves suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Maternal psychiatric illness was, in turn, associated with greater occurrence of psychopathology among offspring, underscoring the importance of developing interventions that address the needs of both children with psychiatric disorders and their at-risk mothers.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study compared background characteristics, pharmacologic treatment, and service use of adults treated for schizoaffective disorder and adults treated for schizophrenia.Methods: Medicaid claims data from two states were analyzed with a focus on adults treated for schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. Patient groups were compared regarding demographic characteristics, pharmacologic treatment, and health service use during 180 days before and after a claim for either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.Results: A larger proportion of patients were treated for schizophrenia (N=38,760; 70.1%) than for schizoaffective disorder (N=16,570; 29.9%). During the 180 days before the index diagnosis claim, significantly more patients with schizoaffective disorder than those with schizophrenia were treated for depressive disorder (19.6% versus 11.4%, p&lt;.001), bipolar disorder (14.8% versus 5.8%, p&lt;.001), substance use disorder (11.8% versus 9.7%, p&lt;.001), and anxiety disorder (6.9% versus 5.3%, p&lt;.001). After the index claim, a similar proportion of both diagnostic groups were treated with antipsychotic medications (schizoaffective disorder, 87.3%; schizophrenia, 87.0%), although patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive antidepressants (61.7% versus 44.0%, p&lt;.001), mood stabilizers (55.2% versus 34.4%, p&lt;.001), and anxiolytics (43.2% versus 35.1%, p&lt;.001). Patients with schizoaffective disorder were also significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive psychotherapy (23.4% versus 13.0%, p&lt;.001) and inpatient mental health care (9.4% versus 6.2%, p&lt;.001), although the latter was not significant after the analysis controlled for background characteristics.Conclusions: Schizoaffective disorder is commonly diagnosed among Medicaid beneficiaries. These patients often receive complex pharmacologic regimens, and many also receive treatment for mood disorders. Differences in service use patterns between schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia argue for separate consideration of their health care needs.</ab>

        <ab>In this study we hypothesised that anxiety/depression, one of five dimensions in the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measurement tool EQ-5D, could predict outcome after total hip replacement surgery. Pre-operative and one-year post-operative data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, including 6158 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the hip, were analysed. In order to examine the association between anxiety and outcome with respect to pain and satisfaction an analysis of covariance was used. The pre-operative EQ-5D anxiety/depression dimension was a strong predictor for pain relief and patient satisfaction (p &lt; 0.001). Orthopaedic surgeons involved in the care of patients eligible for total hip replacement surgery should be aware that mental health may influence post-operative pain and HRQoL. An appropriate assessment of mental health may enable a modification in the way these patients are managed in order to optimise the outcome after joint replacement surgery.</ab>

        <ab>The relation between religion and (or) spirituality (RS), and mental health has shown generally positive associations; however, it is a complex and often emotion-laden field of study. We attempt to examine potential mechanisms that have been proposed as mediators for the RS and mental health relation. We also examine more philosophical areas including patient and physician opinions about inclusion of RS in patient care, and ethical issues that may arise. We review suggested guidelines for sensitive patient inquiry, and opportunities and challenges for education of psychiatrists and trainees. We also study practical ways to incorporate psychospiritual interventions into patient treatment, with specific reference to more common spiritual issues such as forgiveness, gratitude, and altruism.</ab>

        <ab>Motivation has been defined as the process that allows organisms to regulate their internal and external environment, and control the probability, proximity and availability of stimuli. As such, motivation is a complex process that is critical for survival, which involves multiple behavioural functions mediated by a number of interacting neural circuits. Classical theories of motivation suggest that there are both directional and activational aspects of motivation, and activational aspects (i.e. speed and vigour of both the instigation and persistence of behaviour) are critical for enabling organisms to overcome work-related obstacles or constraints that separate them from significant stimuli. The present review discusses the role of brain dopamine and related circuits in behavioural activation, exertion of effort in instrumental behaviour, and effort-related decision-making, based upon both animal and human studies. Impairments in behavioural activation and effort-related aspects of motivation are associated with psychiatric symptoms such as anergia, fatigue, lassitude and psychomotor retardation, which cross multiple pathologies, including depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this review also attempts to provide an interdisciplinary approach that integrates findings from basic behavioural neuroscience, behavioural economics, clinical neuropsychology, psychiatry, and neurology, to provide a coherent framework for future research and theory in this critical field. Although dopamine systems are a critical part of the brain circuitry regulating behavioural activation, exertion of effort, and effort-related decision-making, mesolimbic dopamine is only one part of a distributed circuitry that includes multiple neurotransmitters and brain areas. Overall, there is a striking similarity between the brain areas involved in behavioural activation and effort-related processes in rodents and in humans. Animal models of effort-related decision-making are highly translatable to humans, and an emerging body of evidence indicates that alterations in effort-based decision-making are evident in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. People with major depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease show evidence of decision-making biases towards a lower exertion of effort. Translational studies linking research with animal models, human volunteers, and clinical populations are greatly expanding our knowledge about the neural basis of effort-related motivational dysfunction, and it is hoped that this research will ultimately lead to improved treatment for motivational and psychomotor symptoms in psychiatry and neurology.</ab>

        <ab>This column describes Opening Doors to Recovery in Southeast Georgia, a partnership between public agencies, a private corporation, a not-for-profit organization, and an academic institution. Teams of community navigation specialists that include a licensed mental health professional, a family member of an individual with a serious mental illness, and a peer with lived experience in recovery seek to enhance participants' community integration, support them in developing a meaningful day, ensure access to adequate treatment, and facilitate stable housing, improved relationships, and desired vocational, volunteer, or educational activities.</ab>

        <ab>Our paper offers a perspective on barriers to access to psychiatric care. Research shows that access depends not simply on the total number of trained specialists but also on their kind of practice. In some large cities, some practitioners follow a small number of patients in long-term psychotherapy, a practice supported by government insurance, which places no limits on the number of sessions or treatment duration. The problem is that long-term psychotherapy, despite a rich tradition in psychiatry, is not an evidence-based treatment. This review recommends a model in which psychiatrists spend more time in consultation with primary care professionals, in acute care for patients with severe mental illness, and in briefer, more cost-effective forms of psychotherapy.</ab>
        <ab>Notre article offre une perspective sur les obstacles de l’accès aux soins psychiatriques. La recherche indique que l’accès ne dépend pas simplement du nombre total de spécialistes compétents, mais aussi de leur type de pratique. Dans certaines grandes villes, des médecins suivent un petit nombre de patients dans une psychothérapie à long terme, une pratique soutenue par les assurances du gouvernement, qui n’impose aucune limite au nombre de séances ou à la durée du traitement. Le problème est que la psychothérapie à long terme, malgré une riche tradition établie en psychiatrie, n’est pas un traitement fondé sur des données probantes. Cette revue recommande un modèle dans lequel les psychiatres consacrent plus de temps en consultation avec les professionnels des soins de première ligne, dans les soins actifs pour des patients souffrant de maladie mentale grave, et dans des formes de psychothérapie plus brèves et plus rentables.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study assessed the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder among New York City adults.Methods: As part of the first community-specific Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States, depression and anxiety were assessed in a representative sample of 1,817 noninstitutionalized adults in 2004.Results: A total of 8% had major depressive disorder and 4% had generalized anxiety disorder. Respondents with depression were more likely to be formerly married, publicly insured, younger, and U.S. born. Only 55% of adults with depression were diagnosed, and 38% of those with depression or anxiety were in treatment; individuals with a diagnosis of depression were more likely to receive treatment than those without a diagnosis (61% versus 7%; p&lt;.001). Immigrants with depression were 60% less likely to be diagnosed than their U.S.-born counterparts; immigrants arriving in this country ten or more years ago had slightly more anxiety than immigrants arriving less than ten years ago (3% versus 2%, not significant). Among respondents with anxiety, 23% reported disability compared with 15% of those with depression. Compared with adults with neither diagnosis, adults with depression or anxiety were twice as likely to smoke tobacco (p&lt;.05), adults with depression were twice as likely to have diabetes (p&lt;.01), and those with anxiety were twice as likely to have asthma (p&lt;.01).Conclusions: Mental disorders are often disabling and inadequately diagnosed and treated. Foreign-born adults experience barriers to diagnosis and treatment despite having less depression; anxiety may increase with time since immigration. Increased awareness of and linkage to mental health services are needed, especially in larger, more diverse urban communities.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined use by American Indian and Alaska Native veterans of services provided by specialty telemental health clinics focused on posttraumatic stress disorder. These clinics offer services via videoconferencing to address challenges faced by rural veterans in accessing care.Methods: A retrospective chart and electronic medical record review was conducted for 85 male veterans who used services at two rural telemental health clinics from 2001 through 2006. Service use and other characteristics were documented before and after their initial telemental health intake.Results: After intake, patients' use of any health services (both general medical and mental health services) significantly increased (p&lt;.01), as did the proportion receiving psychotropic medication (p&lt;.01).Conclusions: This first examination of service use by American Indian and Alaska Native veterans at specialty telemental health clinics will help inform research and clinical strategies for improving telemental health for this and other rural populations.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Costs of treating child psychiatric disorders fall on educational, primary care, juvenile justice, and social service agencies as well as on psychiatric services. The authors estimated multiagency mental health costs by integrating service unit costs with utilization rates in an 11-county area. Using psychiatric diagnoses made independently of service use records, the authors calculated costs across agencies as well as the extent of unmet need for psychiatric care. METHOD: Annual parent and child reports were used to measure mental health care needs and units of service across 21 types of settings for the population-based Great Smoky Mountain Study sample of 1,420 adolescents from ages 13 to 16. Unit costs for services were generated from information from service providers and records. The authors calculated costs overall, costs by type of service, and costs by diagnosis. RESULTS: Average annual costs per adolescent treated were $3,146. Juvenile justice and inpatient/residential facilities accounted for well over half of the total costs. Costs for youths with two or more diagnoses were twice as much as costs of those with a single disorder. Among adolescents with service needs, 66.9% received no services. Public health insurance was associated with higher rates of specialty mental health care than either private insurance or no insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Annual costs across all services were three to four times greater than recent health insurance estimates alone. Many costs for adolescents with mental health problems were borne by agencies not designed primarily to provide psychiatric or psychological services. Only one in three adolescents needing psychiatric care received any mental health services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid psychiatric disorders among juvenile detainees.Methods: The sample consisted of a stratified random sample of 898 youths aged ten to 18 years who were arrested and detained in Chicago.Results: Among participants with PTSD, 93% had at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder; however, among those without PTSD, 64% had at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. Over half (54%) of the participants with PTSD had two or more types of comorbid disorders--that is, affective, anxiety, behavioral, or substance use disorders--and 11% had all four types of comorbid disorders. Among males, having any psychiatric diagnosis significantly increased the odds of having comorbid PTSD. Among females, alcohol use disorder and both alcohol and drug use disorders significantly increased the odds of having PTSD. No significant difference in prevalence rates of PTSD was found between males and females with specific psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of any comorbid psychiatric disorder was significantly greater for males with PTSD than that for females with PTSD (OR=3.4, CI=1.1-10.6, p&lt;.05).Conclusions: Detection of comorbid PTSD among detained youths must be improved. PTSD is often missed because traumatic experiences are rarely included in standard screens or volunteered by patients. When planning treatment, clinicians must consider ramifications of comorbid PTSD.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Rates of mental health disorders are significantly greater in children with physical illnesses than in physically well children. Children with neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, are known to have particularly high rates of mental health disorders. Despite this, mental health problems in children with neurological conditions have remained under-recognised and under-treated in clinical settings. Evidence-based guided self-help interventions are efficacious in reducing symptoms of mental health disorders in children, but their efficacy in reducing symptoms of common mental health disorders in children with neurological conditions has not been investigated. We aim to pilot a guided self-help intervention for the treatment of mental health disorders in children with neurological conditions.Methods/design: A pilot randomised controlled trial with 18 patients with neurological conditions and mental health disorders will be conducted. Participants attending specialist neurology clinics at a National UK Children's Hospital will be randomised to receive guided self-help for common mental health disorders or to a 12-week waiting list control. Participants in the treatment group will receive 10 sessions of guided self-help delivered over the telephone. The waiting list control group will receive the intervention after a waiting period of 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is reduction in symptoms of mental health disorders. Exclusion criteria are limited to those at significant risk of harm to self or others, the presence of primary mental health disorder other than anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviour (e.g. psychosis, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) or intellectual disability at a level meaning potential participants would be unable to access the intervention. The study has ethical approval from the Camden and Islington NHS Research Ethics Committee, registration number 14.LO.1353. Results will be disseminated to patients, the wider public, clinicians and researchers through publication in journals and presentation at conferences.Discussion: This is the first study to investigate guided self-help interventions for mental health problems in children with neurological conditions, a group which is currently under-represented in mental health research. The intervention is modular and adapted from an empirically supported cognitive behavioural treatment. The generalisability and broad inclusion criteria are strengths but may also lead to some weaknesses.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN21184717 . Registered on 25 September 2015.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study compared the time patterns of suicide attempts among outpatients starting depression treatment with medication or psychotherapy. METHOD: Outpatient claims from a prepaid health plan were used to identify new episodes of depression treatment beginning with an antidepressant prescription in primary care (N=70,368), an antidepressant prescription from a psychiatrist (N=7,297), or an initial psychotherapy visit (N=54,123). Outpatient and inpatient claims were used to identify suicide attempts or possible suicide attempts during the 90 days before and 180 days after the start of treatment. RESULTS: Overall incidence of suicide attempt was highest among patients receiving antidepressant prescriptions from psychiatrists (1,124 per 100,000), lower among those starting psychotherapy (778 per 100,000), and lowest among those receiving antidepressant prescriptions in primary care (301 per 100,000). The pattern of attempts over time was the same in all three groups: highest in the month before starting treatment, next highest in the month after starting treatment, and declining thereafter. Results were unchanged after eliminating patients receiving overlapping treatment with medication and psychotherapy. Overall incidence of suicide attempt was higher in adolescents and young adults, but the time pattern was the same across all three treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of suicide attempts before and after starting antidepressant treatment is not specific to medication. Differences between treatments and changes over time probably reflect referral patterns and the expected improvement in suicidal ideation after the start of treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors sought to determine whether a greater frequency of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) sessions during maintenance treatment has a greater prophylactic effect than a previously validated once-a-month treatment.Method: A total of 233 women 20-60 years of age with recurrent unipolar depression were treated in an outpatient research clinic. After participants had achieved remission with weekly IPT or, if required, with weekly IPT plus antidepressant pharmacotherapy, they were randomly assigned to weekly, twice-monthly, or monthly maintenance IPT monotherapy for 2 years or until a recurrence of their depression occurred.Results: Among participants who remitted with IPT alone and entered maintenance treatment (N=99), 19 (26%) of the 74 who remained in the study throughout the 2-year maintenance phase experienced a recurrence of depression. Among participants who required the addition of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to achieve remission (N=90), 32 (36%) sustained that remission through continuation treatment and drug discontinuation and began maintenance treatment; of these, 13 (50%) of the 26 who remained in the study throughout the maintenance phase experienced a recurrence. Survival analysis of time to recurrence by randomized treatment frequency showed no effect on recurrence-free survival in either treatment subgroup.Conclusions: These results suggest that maintenance IPT, even at a frequency of only one visit per month, is a good method of prophylaxis for women who can achieve remission with IPT alone. In contrast, among those who require the addition of pharmacotherapy, IPT monotherapy represents a significantly less efficacious approach to maintenance treatment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the first of the two core questions around which the ACCESS (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports) evaluation was designed: Does implementation of system-change strategies lead to better integration of service systems? METHODS: The study was part of the five-year federal ACCESS service demonstration program, which sought to enhance integration of service delivery systems for homeless persons with serious mental illness. Data were gathered from nine randomly selected experimental sites and nine comparison sites in 15 of the nation's largest cities on the degree to which each site implemented a set of systems integration strategies and the degree of systems integration that ensued among community agencies across five service sectors: mental health, substance abuse, primary care, housing, and social welfare and entitlement services. Integration was measured across all interorganizational relationships in the local service networks (overall systems integration) and across relationships involving only the primary ACCESS grantee organization (project-centered integration). RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, the nine experimental sites did not demonstrate significantly greater overall systems integration than the nine comparison sites. However, the experimental sites demonstrated better project-centered integration than the comparison sites. Moreover, more extensive implementation of strategies for system change was associated with higher levels of overall systems integration as well as project-centered integration at both the experimental sites and the comparison sites. CONCLUSIONS: The ACCESS demonstration was successful in terms of project-centered integration but not overall system integration.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study determined the gap between actual care and optimal care (recommended in the clinical guideline) for patients with borderline personality disorder in the Netherlands. Factors that affected guideline implementation were identified.Methods: Ten specialized mental health organizations participated in this cross-sectional study. The number and proportion of patients who received optimal diagnosis and treatment were calculated. Focus groups explored implementation barriers.Results: Records of 422 patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder were analyzed, and 315 records from six organizations contained the necessary data. Across the six organizations, most of these patients received this as an initial diagnosis (median 85%). However, only a minority received psychotherapy as a first-step treatment (median 23%). Capacity problems and organizational barriers were the main barriers to providing psychotherapy.Conclusions: Most patients with borderline personality disorder did not receive the recommended first-step treatment (psychotherapy). Care pathways may help improve efficiency and quality of care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether psychosocial factors that are related to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes predict prospectively the risk for the metabolic syndrome using the different clinical criteria available for defining the syndrome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Women were enrolled in a population-based prospective cohort study called the Healthy Women Study and were followed for an average of 15 years after baseline. Metabolic syndrome was defined via the World Health Organization, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, and the International Diabetes Foundation clinical criteria. RESULTS: Among women who did not have the metabolic syndrome at the baseline, the risk for the metabolic syndrome defined in multiple ways varied from 1.21- to 2.12-fold ([95% CI 1.00-4.25], P &lt; 0.05) for more severe depressive symptoms or very stressful life event(s). These associations were largely the same, regardless of the clinical criteria used to define the metabolic syndrome. Those who at the baseline reported feeling frequently and intensely angry, tense, or stressed also had an increased risk for developing the metabolic syndrome at least by one definition (relative risk 1.19-1.66 [1.00-2.39]). CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data to demonstrate that psychosocial factors predict the risk for developing the metabolic syndrome by multiple definitions. Psychosocial factors may play a causal role in the chain of events leading to the metabolic syndrome.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Homelessness and patterns of service use were examined among seriously mentally ill persons in an area with a well-funded community-based mental health system. METHODS: The sample consisted of 438 individuals referred between 1990 and 1992 to an extended acute care psychiatric hospital after a stay in a general hospital. Those experiencing an episode of homelessness, defined as an admission to a public shelter between 1990 and 1993, were compared with those who were residentially stable. Data from a longitudinal integrated database of public mental health and medical services were used to construct service utilization measures to test the mediating effect of outpatient mental health care on preventing homelessness. RESULTS: A homelessness rate of 24 percent was found among the 438 persons with serious mental illness. Those who experienced homelessness were more likely to be African American, receive general assistance, and have a comorbid substance abuse problem. They used significantly more inpatient psychiatric, emergency, and health care services than the subjects who did not become homeless. Forty to 50 percent of the homeless group received outpatient care during the year before and after their shelter episode. The number of persons who received intensive case management services increased after shelter admission. CONCLUSIONS: An enhanced community-based mental health system was not sufficient to prevent homelessness among high-risk persons with serious mental illness. Eleven percent of this group experienced homelessness after referral to an extended acute care facility. Strategies to prevent homelessness should be considered, perhaps at the time of discharge from the referring community hospital or extended acute care facility.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Use of mental health care was investigated as a function of gender, traumatic event frequency, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attitudes toward treatment among 194 primary care patients. METHODS: Patients were recruited from primary care clinics, administered the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire, PTSD Symptom Scale, Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form, and a survey on use of services. RESULTS: Lifetime mental health treatment was related to increased frequency of traumatic events, positive attitudes toward treatment, and probable PTSD. Recent use of mental health care and intensity of use were related to female gender and greater frequency of trauma. Regression models yielded significant associations for trauma frequency, positive treatment attitudes, and female gender. Trauma and PTSD were associated with use more than gender and treatment attitudes were. CONCLUSIONS: Use of and adherence to treatment may be improved by targeting attitudes toward treatment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This article explores the link between violence and the practice of legally mandating treatment in the community or leveraging benefits from the social welfare system, such as subsidized housing and disability income support, to ensure adherence to treatment. METHOD: Data are presented from a survey of 1,011 persons with psychiatric disorders receiving treatment in public mental health service systems in five U.S. cities. Multinomial logit analysis was used to examine the association between physically assaultive behavior and experience of social welfare leverage, legal leverage, or both types of leverage, with the analyses controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Across study sites, 18% to 21% of participants reported having committed violent acts in the past 6 months; 3% to 9% reported having used or made threats with a lethal weapon, committed sexual assault, or caused injury. About three-quarters of subjects who reported such serious violence also reported having experienced some form of leveraged treatment, compared with about one-half of subjects who did not report serious violence. Demographic and clinical factors that were independently associated with the likelihood of experiencing both types of leverage included younger age, male gender, poorer clinical functioning, more years in treatment, more frequent hospitalizations, higher frequency of outpatient visits, and negative attitudes toward medication adherence. Among participants who did not voluntarily take psychotropic medication, even minor assaultiveness was associated with having experienced legal leverage. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of concerns about safety and treatment nonadherence may influence decisions by clinicians and judges to apply legal leverage.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Many mothers bringing children for community mental health treatment need mental health services themselves. Moreover, children of mothers with mental health problems enter treatment with more severe symptomatology than do other children. However, little is known about how maternal mental health problems affect children's response to treatment. This study examined the impact of maternal mental health status on the child's treatment response. METHODS: The mental health of 272 mother-child pairs was assessed twice, when children entered treatment at three community mental health clinics and again three months later. Analysis of variance was used to examine the impact of maternal mental health status on children's rate of improvement. RESULTS: Children of mothers with mental health problems had significantly greater behavior problems (F=34.54, p&lt;.001) and demonstrated less improvement over time (F=4.44, p=.04) than children of mentally healthy mothers. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that treatment for mothers as well as children could be beneficial for this population.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15% to 25% of pregnant women. However, substantial barriers to psychosocial assessment exist, resulting in less than 20% of prenatal care providers assessing and treating mental health problems. Moreover, pregnant women are often reluctant to disclose their mental health concerns to a healthcare provider. Identifying screening and assessment tools and procedures that are acceptable to both women and service providers, cost-effective, and clinically useful is needed.Methods/design: The primary objective of this randomized, parallel-group, superiority trial is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a computer tablet-based prenatal psychosocial assessment (e-screening) compared to paper-based screening. Secondary objectives are to compare the two modes of screening on: (1) the level of detection of prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms and psychosocial risk; (2) the level of disclosure of symptoms; (3) the factors associated with feasibility, acceptability, and disclosure; (4) the psychometric properties of the e-version of the assessment tools; and (5) cost-effectiveness. A sample of 542 women will be recruited from large, primary care maternity clinics and a high-risk antenatal unit in an urban Canadian city. Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they: (1) receive care at one of the recruitment sites; (2) are able to speak/read English; (3) are willing to be randomized to e-screening; and (4) are willing to participate in a follow-up diagnostic interview within 1 week of recruitment. Allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment on a computer tablet, while those in the control group will complete the same assessment in paper-based form. All women will complete baseline questionnaires at the time of recruitment and will participate in a diagnostic interview within 1 week of recruitment. Research assistants conducting diagnostic interviews and physicians will be blinded. A qualitative descriptive study involving healthcare providers from the recruitment sites and women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We hypothesize that mental health e-screening in primary care maternity settings and high-risk antenatal units will be as or more feasible, acceptable, and capable of detecting depression, anxiety, and psychosocial risk compared to paper-based screening.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01899534.</ab>

        <ab>Depression and inflammation fuel one another. Inflammation plays a key role in depression's pathogenesis for a subset of depressed individuals; depression also primes larger cytokine responses to stressors and pathogens that do not appear to habituate. Accordingly, treatment decisions may be informed by attention to questions of how (pathways) and for whom (predispositions) these links exist, which are the focus of this article. When combined with predisposing factors (moderators such as childhood adversity and obesity), stressors and pathogens can lead to exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory responses. The resulting sickness behaviors (e.g., pain, disturbed sleep), depressive symptoms, and negative health behaviors (e.g., poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle) may act as mediating pathways that lead to further, unrestrained inflammation and depression. Depression, childhood adversity, stressors, and diet can all influence the gut microbiome and promote intestinal permeability, another pathway to enhanced inflammatory responses. Larger, more frequent, or more prolonged inflammatory responses could have negative mental and physical health consequences. In clinical practice, inflammation provides a guide to potential targets for symptom management by signaling responsiveness to certain therapeutic strategies. For example, a theme across research with cytokine antagonists, omega-3 fatty acids, celecoxib, and exercise is that anti-inflammatory interventions have a substantially greater impact on mood in individuals with heightened inflammation. Thus, when inflammation and depression co-occur, treating them in tandem may enhance recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. The bidirectional links between depression, inflammation, and disease suggest that effective depression treatments could have a far-reaching impact on mood, inflammation, and health.</ab>
        <ab>La depresión y la inflamación se alimentan mutuamente. La inflamación juega un papel clave en la patogénesis de la depresión para un subconjunto de individuos deprimidos; la depresión también favorece mayores respuestas de las citokinas a los factores estresantes y patógenos que no parecen ser habituales. Por consiguiente, las decisiones de tratamiento pueden estar basadas en las preguntas de cómo (vías) y para quién (predisposiciones) existen estos enlaces entre inflamación y depresión, que son el tema de este artículo. Los factores estresantes y los patógenos, cuando están combinados con factores de predisposición (moderadores como adversidades en la infancia y obesidad), pueden conducir a respuestas inflamatorias exageradas o prolongadas. Las conductas de enfermedad resultantes (por ejemplo, dolor, alteraciones del sueño), los síntomas depresivos y las conductas de salud negativas (p. ej., mala dieta, estilo de vida sedentario) pueden actuar como vías mediadoras que conducen a una inflamación y una depresión mayores e incontroladas. Tanto la depresión como las adversidades en la infancia, los factores estresantes y la dieta, pueden influenciar el microbioma intestinal y aumentar la permeabilidad intestinal otra vía para las respuestas inflamatorias aumentadas. Las respuestas inflamatorias mayores, más frecuentes o más prolongadas podrían tener consecuencias negativas para la salud mental y física. En la práctica clínica, la inflamación ofrece una guía hacia posibles objetivos del manejo de síntomas al señalar la reactividad a ciertas estrategias terapéuticas. Por ejemplo, un tema en la investigación con antagonistas de las citokinas, con ácidos grasos de Omega-3 y con el ejercicio es que las intervenciones anti-inflamatorias tienen un impacto substancialmente mayor en el estado de ánimo de individuos con inflamación aumentada. Así, cuando la inflamación y la depresión se dan simultáneamente, tratarlas en tándem puede favorecer la recuperación y reducir el riesgo de recurrencia. Los enlaces bidireccionales entre la depresión, la inflamación y la enfermedad sugieren que los tratamientos efectivos de la depresión podrían tener un impacto de amplias consecuencias en el estado de ánimo, la inflamación y la salud.</ab>

        <ab>Mental disorders such as depression and alcohol use disorders often co-occur with other common noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, noncommunicable diseases are frequently encountered in patients with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia. The pathways underlying the comorbidity of mental disorders and noncommunicable diseases are complex. For example, mental and physical noncommunicable diseases may have common environmental risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyles, and treatments for one condition may have side effects that increase the risk of another condition. Building on the robust evidence base for effective treatments for a range of mental disorders, there is now a growing evidence base for how such treatments can be integrated into the care of people with noncommunicable diseases. The best-established delivery model is a team approach that features a nonspecialist case manager who coordinates care with primary care physicians and specialists. This approach maximizes efficiencies in person-centered care, which are essential for achieving universal health coverage for both noncommunicable diseases and mental disorders. A number of research gaps remain, but there is sufficient evidence for policy makers to immediately implement measures to integrate mental health and noncommunicable disease care in primary care platforms.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Emotional disorders (depression and anxiety disorders) are highly prevalent mental health problems. Although evidence showing the effectiveness of disorder-specific treatments exists, high comorbidity rates among emotional disorders limit the utility of these protocols. This has led some researchers to focus their interest on transdiagnostic interventions, a treatment perspective that might be more widely effective across these disorders. Also, the current way of delivering treatments makes it difficult provide assistance to all of the population in need. The use of the Internet in the delivery of evidence-based treatments may help to disseminate treatments among the population. In this study, we aim to test the effectiveness of EmotionRegulation, a new transdiagnostic Internet-based protocol for unipolar mood disorders, five anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified), and obsessive-compulsive disorder in comparison to treatment as usual as provided in Spanish public specialized mental health care. We will also study its potential impact on basic temperament dimensions (neuroticism/behavioral inhibition and extraversion/behavioral activation). Expectations and opinions of patients about this protocol will also be studied.Methods/design: The study is a randomized controlled trial. 200 participants recruited in specialized care will be allocated to one of two treatment conditions: a) EmotionRegulation or b) treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures will be the BAI and the BDI-II. Secondary outcomes will include a specific measure of the principal disorder, and measures of neuroticism/behavioral inhibition and extraversion/behavioral activation. Patients will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Intention to treat and per protocol analyses will be performed.Discussion: Although the effectiveness of face-to-face transdiagnostic protocols has been investigated in previous studies, the number of published transdiagnostic Internet-based programs is still quite low. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial studying the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic Internet-based treatment for several emotional disorders in public specialized care. Combining both a transdiagnostic approach with an Internet-based therapy format may help to decrease the burden of mental disorders, reducing the difficulties associated with disorder-specific treatments and facilitating access to people in need of treatment. Strengths and limitations are discussed.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02345668 . Registered 27 July 2015.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: This six-month prospective study of 326 patients with substance use disorders assessed rates of depression and anxiety symptoms among patients entering addiction treatment and examined the effects of concurrent psychiatric symptoms on indicators of addiction treatment outcome. METHODS: Initial assessments included semistructured clinical interviews, the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL90-R). Patients were reassessed at six months to determine treatment outcome (abstinence status and duration of continuous abstinence). RESULTS: A majority of the sample (63 percent) had significant psychiatric symptoms at intake: 15 percent (N=49) presented with depressive symptoms, 16 percent (N=53) with anxiety symptoms, and 32 percent (N=105) with combined depressive and anxiety symptoms. Forty percent of patients who presented with combined depression and anxiety symptoms were abstinent at six months. These patients fared worse than those who were less symptomatic at intake, including those who presented with depression symptoms alone; in the latter group, 73 percent were abstinent at six months. The hierarchical regression models accounted for 22 percent of the variance in the duration of continuous abstinence, 26 percent of the variance in the frequency of drug use at six months, and 39 percent of the variance in abstinence status at six months. Key predictor variables included days in treatment, primary drug of abuse, frequency of drug use, and report of concurrent depression or anxiety symptoms at intake. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent depression or anxiety symptoms at intake had a small but significant predictive effect on addiction treatment outcome over and above factors that are clearly known to influence outcome (length of stay in treatment and initial addiction severity).</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Case management studies from Europe and the United States continue to yield conflicting results. At a symposium at the World Psychiatric Conference in Hamburg in 1999, researchers from four European countries explored the possible reasons for differences in outcome. They also examined reasons for the differing foci of case management studies across the different cultures. The authors summarize the symposium's findings. Methods: Individual case presentations were given of studies and services from the United Kingdom (three studies), Sweden (two studies), Germany, and Italy (one each). Outcomes, methodologies, and national service context were examined. Results and Conclusions: A significant influence of national culture is evident both in the acceptability of case management and in approaches to researching it. Case management is perceived as an "Anglophone import" in Italy but is now national policy for persons with severe mental illness in the other three countries. Studies from the United Kingdom emphasized methodological rigor, with little attention to treatment content, whereas those from Sweden accepted a less disruptive research approach but with a more prescriptive stipulation of treatment content. Studies from Italy and Germany emphasized the importance of differing descriptive methodologies. Marked differences in the range of social care provision were noted across Europe. Overall, European researchers are less concerned than U.S. researchers with studying the impact of case management on hospital use.</ab>

        <ab>Evidence-based practice (EBP) requires that clinicians be guided by the best available evidence. In this article, we address the impact of science and pseudoscience on psychotherapy in psychiatric practice. We describe the key principles of evidence-based intervention. We describe pseudoscience and provide illustrative examples of popular intervention practices that have not been abandoned, despite evidence that they are not efficacious and may be harmful. We distinguish efficacy from effectiveness, and describe modular approaches to treatment. Reasons for the persistence of practices that are not evidence based are examined at both the individual and the professional system level. Finally, we offer suggestions for the promotion of EBP through clinical practice guidelines, modelling of scientific decision making, and training in core skills.</ab>
        <ab>La pratique fondée sur des données probantes (PFDP) exige que les cliniciens soient guidés par les meilleures données probantes. Dans cet article, nous abordons l'effet de la science et de la pseudoscience sur la psychothérapie dans la pratique psychiatrique. Nous décrivons les principaux principes d'une intervention fondée sur des données probantes. Nous décrivons la pseudoscience et offrons des exemples illustrant les pratiques d'intervention populaires qui n'ont pas été abandonnées, malgré qu'il soit prouvé qu'elles ne sont pas efficaces et peuvent être nuisibles. Nous distinguons entre efficience et efficacité, et décrivons les approches modulaires du traitement. Les raisons de la persistance des pratiques qui ne sont pas fondées sur des données probantes sont examinées au niveau individuel et professionnel du système. Enfin, nous offrons des suggestions pour la promotion de la PFDP par des guides de pratique clinique, la modélisation de la prise de décisions scientifiques, et la formation en compétences de base.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study assessed rates of detection and treatment of minor and major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder among pregnant women receiving prenatal care at public-sector obstetric clinics. METHODS: Interviewers systematically screened 387 women attending prenatal visits. The screening process was initiated before each woman's examination. After the visit, patients were asked whether their clinician recognized a mood or anxiety disorder. Medical records were reviewed for documentation of psychiatric illness and treatment. RESULTS: Only 26 percent of patients who screened positive for a psychiatric illness were recognized as having a mood or anxiety disorder by their health care provider. Moreover, clinicians detected disorders among only 12 percent of patients who showed evidence of suicidal ideation. Women with panic disorder or a lifetime history of domestic violence were more likely to be identified as having a psychiatric illness by a health care provider at some point before or during pregnancy. All women who screened positive for panic disorder had received or were currently receiving mental health treatment outside the prenatal visit, whereas 26 percent of women who screened positive for major or minor depression had received or were currently receiving treatment outside the prenatal visit. CONCLUSIONS: Detection rates for depressive disorders in obstetric settings are lower than those for panic disorder and lower than those reported in other primary care settings. Consequently, a large proportion of pregnant women continue to suffer silently with depression throughout their pregnancy. Given that depressive disorders among perinatal women are highly prevalent and may have profound impact on infants and children, more work is needed to enhance detection and referral.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: There is a recognized association among depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to examine in a sample representative of the general population whether depression, anxiety, and psychological distress are associated with metabolic syndrome and its components. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three cross-sectional surveys including clinical health measures were completed in rural regions of Australia during 2004-2006. A stratified random sample (n = 1,690, response rate 48%) of men and women aged 25-84 years was selected from the electoral roll. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and psychological distress by the Kessler 10 measure. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was associated with depression but not psychological distress or anxiety. Participants with the metabolic syndrome had higher scores for depression (n = 409, mean score 3.41, 95% CI 3.12-3.70) than individuals without the metabolic syndrome (n = 936, mean 2.95, 95% CI 2.76-3.13). This association was also present in 338 participants with the metabolic syndrome and without diabetes (mean score 3.37, 95% CI 3.06-3.68). Large waist circumference and low HDL cholesterol showed significant and independent associations with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show an association between metabolic syndrome and depression in a heterogeneous sample. The presence of depression in individuals with the metabolic syndrome has implications for clinical management.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: While the evidence base for treatments for adolescent depression is building, little is known about the relative efficiency of such treatments. Treatment costs are a relevant concern given the competing demands on family and health care budgets. The authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three active treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder.Method: Volunteers (N=439) ages 12 to 18 with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder participated in a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 13 U.S. academic and community clinics from 2000 to 2004. Subjects included those participants who did not drop out and had evaluable outcome and cost data at 12 weeks (N=369). Subjects were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either fluoxetine alone (10-40 mg/day), CBT alone, CBT combined with fluoxetine (10-40 mg/day), or placebo (equivalent to 10-40 mg/day). Both placebo and fluoxetine were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT in combination with fluoxetine were administered unblinded. Societal cost per unit of improvement on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were compared.Results: Results ranged from an incremental cost over placebo of $24,000 per QALY for treatment with fluoxetine to $123,000 per QALY for combination therapy treatment. The cost-effectiveness ratio for CBT treatment was not evaluable due to negative clinical effects. The models were robust on a variety of assumptions.Conclusions: Both fluoxetine and combination therapy are at least as cost-effective in the short-term as other treatments commonly used in primary care (using a threshold of $125,000/QALY). Fluoxetine is more cost-effective than combination therapy after 12 weeks of treatment.</ab>

        <ab>STUDY OBJECTIVE: Insomnia impacts the course of major depressive disorder (MDD), hinders response to treatment, and increases risk for depressive relapse. This study is an initial evaluation of adding cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to the antidepressant medication escitalopram (EsCIT) in individuals with both disorders. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, controlled, pilot study in a single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 30 individuals (61% female, mean age 35 +/- 18) with MDD and insomnia. INTERVENTIONS: EsCIT and 7 individual therapy sessions of CBTI or CTRL (quasi-desensitization). Measurements and results: Depression was assessed with the HRSD17 and the depression portion of the SCID, administered by raters masked to treatment assignment, at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was remission of MDD at study exit, which required both an HRSD17 score &lt; or =7 and absence of the 2 core symptoms of MDD. Sleep was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI), daily sleep diaries, and actigraphy. EsCIT + CBTI resulted in a higher rate of remission of depression (61.5%) than EsCIT + CTRL (33.3%). EsCIT + CBTI was also associated with a greater remission from insomnia (50.0%) than EsCIT + CTRL (7.7%) and larger improvement in all diary and actigraphy measures of sleep, except for total sleep time. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides evidence that augmenting an antidepressant medication with a brief, symptom focused, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is promising for individuals with MDD and comorbid insomnia in terms of alleviating both depression and insomnia.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: In a randomized controlled trial, a vocationally integrated program of assertive community treatment (ACT) was compared with a certified clubhouse in the delivery of supported employment services.Methods: Employment rates, total work hours, and earnings for 121 adults with serious mental illness interested in work were compared with published benchmark figures for exemplary supported employment programs. The two programs were then compared on service engagement, retention, and employment outcomes in regression analyses that controlled for background characteristics, program preference, and vocational service receipt.Results: Outcomes for 63 ACT and 58 clubhouse participants met or exceeded most published outcomes for specialized supported employment teams. Compared with the clubhouse program, the ACT program had significantly (p&lt;.05) better service engagement (ACT, 98 percent; clubhouse, 74 percent) and retention (ACT, 79 percent; clubhouse, 58 percent) over 24 months, but there was no significant difference in employment rates (ACT, 64 percent; clubhouse, 47 percent). Compared with ACT participants, clubhouse participants worked significantly longer (median of 199 days versus 98 days) for more total hours (median of 494 hours versus 234 hours) and earned more (median of $3,456 versus $1,252 total earnings). Better work performance by clubhouse participants was partially attributable to higher pay.Conclusions: Vocationally integrated ACT and certified clubhouses can achieve employment outcomes similar to those of exemplary supported employment teams. Certified clubhouses can effectively provide supported employment along with other rehabilitative services, and the ACT program can ensure continuous integration of supported employment with clinical care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents with functional recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is unknown. Our aim was to determine whether RAP is associated with psychiatric symptoms and disorders, anxious temperament, and functional impairment in pediatric primary care. METHODS: Children and adolescents who were 8 to 15 years of age, inclusive, and presented with RAP (N = 42) or for routine care in the absence of recurrent pain (N = 38) were identified by a screening procedure in pediatric primary care office waiting rooms and recruited to participate in a case-control study. Outcome measures were psychiatric diagnoses generated by standardized psychiatric interview administered blind to subject status and self, parent, and clinician ratings of child psychiatric symptoms, temperamental traits, and functional status. RESULTS: RAP patients were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, with a categorical anxiety disorder in 33 (79%) and a depressive disorder in 18 patients (43%), and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, temperamental harm avoidance, and functional impairment than control subjects. Anxiety disorders (mean age of onset: 6.25 [standard deviation: 2.17] years) were significantly more likely to precede RAP (mean age of onset: 9.17 [standard deviation: 2.75] years) in patients with associated anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Youths who present with RAP in primary care deserve careful assessment for anxiety and depressive disorders. Future studies should examine treatments that are proved to be efficacious for pediatric anxiety and/or depressive disorders as potential interventions for RAP. Longitudinal, family, and psychobiological studies are needed to illuminate the nature of observed associations among RAP, anxiety, and depression.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with higher rates of health complaints and medical conditions diagnosed by physicians, yet research examining the relationship between PTSD and health care utilization has been limited. This study compared the health service use of veterans with PTSD to that of help-seeking veterans without PTSD. The relationship between severity of PTSD and service utilization was also examined. METHOD: Data were collected from 996 veterans seeking an evaluation at a Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center specialty PTSD clinic in the southeastern United States between March 1992 and September 1998. Data included sociodemographic characteristics, severity of PTSD, and disability status. The outcome variable, VA health service utilization, was prospectively assessed 1 year from the date of the initial PTSD assessment. RESULTS: Although the use of VA mental health services by patients with PTSD was substantial (a median of seven clinic stops), these patients used more services in general physical health clinics that provided predominantly nonmental health services (a median of 18 clinic stops). Negative binomial regression models revealed that younger veterans with PTSD had greater health care utilization than those without PTSD who also sought services. Greater severity of PTSD was related to higher rates of mental and physical health service use among veterans without a service-connected disability. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is associated with substantial health service use. The results highlight the importance of increased collaboration between primary care and mental health specialists, given that patients with PTSD are more likely to receive treatment in nonmental health clinics.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Seeking Safety is a manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention that is designed to treat clients with comorbid substance abuse and trauma histories. This study examined its effectiveness when used with homeless women veterans with psychiatric or substance abuse problems at 11 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers that had Homeless Women Veterans Programs.Methods: The intervention consists of 25 sessions that cover topics to help build safety in clients' lives and is present-focused, offering psychoeducation and coping skills. A cohort of homeless women veterans (N=359) was recruited before Seeking Safety was implemented (phase I). After clinicians were trained and certified in Seeking Safety, a postimplementation cohort was recruited and offered Seeking Safety treatment (phase II, N=91). Phase I lasted from January 2000 to June 2003. Phase II lasted from June 2003 to December 2005. The intervention lasted for six months. All participants were interviewed every three months for one year and received intensive case management and other services during the study. Mixed models were used to compare one-year clinical outcomes across phases.Results: There were few differences across groups at baseline. All women entering the Homeless Women Veterans Programs showed significant improvement on most clinical outcome measures over one year. The Seeking Safety cohort reported significantly better outcomes over one year in employment, social support, general symptoms of psychiatric distress, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, particularly in the avoidance and arousal clusters. However, the Seeking Safety cohort was significantly more likely to have used drugs in the past 30 days.Conclusions: Seeking Safety appears to have had a moderately beneficial impact on several clinical outcomes. Although the nonequivalent comparison groups and low follow-up rates limit the internal validity of these results, availability of Seeking Safety may be of benefit for homeless female veterans. It is noteworthy that it could be delivered and implemented by case managers with little or no prior counseling experience.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Information about the psychiatric histories of adults with anxiety disorders was examined to further inform nosology and etiological/ preventive efforts.Method: The authors used data from a prospective longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort (N=1,037) from ages 11 to 32 years, making psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM criteria. For adults with anxiety disorders at 32 years, follow-back analyses ascertained first diagnosis of anxiety and other juvenile disorders.Results: Of adults with each type of anxiety disorder, approximately half had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (one-third with an anxiety disorder) by age 15. The juvenile histories of psychiatric problems for adults with different types of anxiety disorders were largely nonspecific, partially reflecting comorbidity at 32 years. Histories of anxiety and depression were most common. There was also specificity. For example, adults with panic disorder did not have histories of juvenile disorders, whereas those with other anxiety disorders did. Adults with posttraumatic stress disorder had histories of conduct disorder, whereas those with other anxiety disorders did not. Adults with specific phobia had histories of juvenile phobias but not other anxiety disorders.Conclusions: Strong comorbidity between different anxiety disorders and lack of specificity in developmental histories of adults with anxiety disorders supports a hierarchical approach to classification, with a broad class of anxiety disorders having individual disorders within it. The early first diagnosis of psychiatric difficulties in individuals with anxiety disorders suggests the need to target research examining the etiology of anxiety disorders and prevention early in life.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The concept of recovery has received increasing emphasis in the delivery of services to persons with schizophrenia. This study was an initial effort to develop an empirically based model of factors associated with a recovery orientation. METHODS: The authors reanalyzed data from 825 persons with schizophrenia who were assessed in the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) client survey. Multiple regression models were used to identify client and service use variables associated with each of four domains identified as important to a recovery orientation: life satisfaction, hope and optimism, knowledge about mental illness and services, and empowerment. RESULTS: In each regression model, the strongest relationship was observed between recovery orientation and lower severity of depressive symptoms. Both receipt of family psychoeducation and fewer side effects of medications were significantly and positively related to three of the four recovery domains. Psychotic symptoms were associated with less life satisfaction. Receipt of various services, including day treatment and legal services, was positively associated with knowledge about illness and services. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of psychiatric symptoms, a core feature of the biomedical perspective of mental illness, was negatively associated with a recovery orientation, and use of a variety of standard services were positively associated with a recovery orientation. Thus a polarized view of biomedical and recovery perspectives on mental illness may be unfounded, given that these perspectives appear to be mutually reinforcing.</ab>

        <ab>Commitment to community-based mental health treatment bears limited resemblance to commitment to treatment in a closed institution. It can be better understood in the context of a broad movement to apply leverage to induce treatment engagement, a movement that includes use of the social welfare and justice systems and psychiatric advance directives. Understanding 'mandated community treatment' in all of its forms can be advanced by viewing it within the framework of health care quality as recently outlined by the Institute of Medicine, particularly along the dimension of patient-centeredness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Little research has focused on the mental health of Latino caregivers with a relative with schizophrenia, despite data showing that up to three-quarters of Latino persons with schizophrenia live with their families. This study examined the relation between caregivers' mental health and perceived burden and stigma and characteristics of the patient and caregiver.Methods: Interviews were conducted in the language of preference (Spanish or English) in Wisconsin, California, and Texas with 85 Latinos caring for an adult with schizophrenia. Measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, the Zarit Burden Scale, and the Greenley Stigma Scale.Results: General population studies of Mexican Americans have found that between 12% and 18% meet the cutoff for being at risk of depression; however, 40% of the sample met this criterion. Younger caregiver age, lower levels of caregivers' education, and higher levels of the patients' mental illness symptoms were predictive of higher levels of caregivers' depressive symptoms. Caregivers' perceived burden mediated the relation between patients' psychiatric symptoms and caregivers' depression. Caregivers' perceived stigma was significantly related to caregivers' depressive symptoms, even when the analyses statistically adjusted for psychiatric symptoms and demographic variables.Conclusions: The high rates of depressive symptoms among Latino families caring for a relative with schizophrenia suggest that interventions should include attention to the mental health and recovery of family caregivers in addition to the patient's recovery. Younger Latino caregivers and those with lower levels of education are particularly at risk of depression.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to determine neonatal outcomes among women who had depressive and anxiety disorders during the second trimester of pregnancy in a population-based sample. Participants were 1,465 women and their neonates born at two obstetric clinics in Sweden. The inclusion period for the women was October 2, 2000-October 1, 2001. The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) classification system was used to evaluate mental disorders in the second trimester of pregnancy. For assessment of demographic characteristics, birth statistics, and birth-related complications, the medical records of the included women and their offspring were reviewed after delivery. The study results revealed no differences in neonatal outcome between women with antenatal depressive disorders and/or anxiety disorders and healthy subjects. The authors conclude that neonatal outcome did not deteriorate despite the women's impaired mental health during pregnancy.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This research extends a series of studies that have examined the process of psychotherapy. The authors hypothesized that manual regimens of psychotherapy compared in a controlled clinical trial would overlap considerably in process and technique and that intervention strategies common to both treatments would be responsible for promoting patient change. METHOD: Expert therapists developed prototypes of the ideal regimens of brief interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy using the Psychotherapy Process Q-Set, an instrument designed to provide a standard language for describing treatment processes. A separate set of clinical judges then used the Psychotherapy Process Q-Set to score the actual transcripts of interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy sessions conducted as part of the NIMH Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program. The expert prototypes were then compared with actual therapy administered in order to determine the extent to which each form of therapy conformed to its ideal prototype. RESULTS: Both the interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy sessions adhered most strongly to the ideal prototype of cognitive behavior therapy. In addition, adherence to the cognitive behavior therapy prototype yielded more positive correlations with outcome measures across both types of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Relying on brand names of therapy can be misleading. These findings suggest that the basic premise of controlled clinical trials (i.e., that the compared interventions represent separate and distinct treatments) may not have been met in the NIMH Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program. The implications of these findings for using controlled clinical trials to study psychotherapy are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors compared a combination of clomipramine and psychodynamic psychotherapy with clomipramine alone in a randomized controlled trial among patients with major depression. METHODS: Seventy-four patients between the ages of 20 and 65 years who were assigned to ten weeks of acute outpatient treatment for major depression were studied. Bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, severe substance dependence, organic disorder, past intolerance to clomipramine, and mental retardation were exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Marked improvement was noted in both treatment groups. Combined treatment was associated with less treatment failure and better work adjustment at ten weeks and with better global functioning and lower hospitalization rates at discharge. A cost savings of 2,311 dollars per patient in the combined treatment group, associated with lower rates of hospitalization and fewer lost work days, exceeded the expenditures related to providing psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of supplemental psychodynamic psychotherapy to patients with major depression who are receiving antidepressant medication is cost-effective.</ab>

        <ab>This study compared experts' views on the critical ingredients of assertive community treatment and intensive case management. Twenty experts on assertive community treatment and 22 experts on intensive case management rated the importance of 40 elements common to each treatment approach. The assertive community treatment experts gave higher importance ratings than the intensive case management experts to 37 of the 40 items; for 21 of these items, the ratings were significantly higher. Differences in importance ratings were greatest for organizational and structural elements and smallest for treatment goals. The results of this study indicate that although intensive case management resembles assertive community treatment in most respects, assertive community treatment may be a more clearly articulated model overall.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether outcomes in housing, clinical status, and well-being of persons with severe mental illness and a history of homelessness differ between those in supported housing and those in community residences, two housing arrangements that substantially differ in the level of independence that is offered to its tenants. METHODS: A quasi-experimental 18-month follow-up study was conducted with 157 persons newly entering supported housing and community residences. The housing models accepted persons with similar illness characteristics and homelessness histories, so that the inability to randomly assign tenants to housing types could be compensated for by propensity scoring methods. Tenure in housing was examined by using survival models. Analyses of other outcomes used hierarchical linear and regression models in both intent-to-treat (N=139) and true-stayer (N=80) analyses. RESULTS: Tenure in housing did not differ by housing type. Substantial proportions of tenants in both models remained housed during the follow-up period. Tenants in supported housing reported greater housing satisfaction in terms of autonomy and economic viability. Over time some tenants in supported housing reported greater feelings of isolation. Independent of housing type, symptoms of depression or anxiety at housing entry increased the risk of poorer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The models of supported housing were viable portals of entry into community housing for homeless persons, even for consumers with characteristics indicating that they would have been more likely to be placed in community residences. The results suggest that greater clinical attention should be paid to persons who exhibit depression or anxiety when entering housing.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study sought to understand how case managers in one publicly funded health and social service system, community long-term care, understand and address depression among their clients.Methods: Four focus groups with a total of 18 case managers were conducted. Case managers were asked a series of questions about their perspectives on the recognition and treatment of depression, including subthreshold depression, in community long-term care.Results: Case managers perceived addressing depression as complex because of competing demands. Furthermore, case managers perceived conflict between their current role and what it would take to expand their role to include addressing depression.Conclusions: Case managers suggested that in order to successfully improve the detection and treatment of depression in community long-term care, systemic changes, such as increased support and training, may be necessary, along with a shift in the professional role of case managers.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors developed, implemented, and pilot-tested intervention programs to provide effective care for chronic or recurrent depression.Methods: A total of 104 patients with chronic or recurrent depression were randomly assigned to one of four groups: continued usual behavioral health care, usual care plus telephone monitoring and care management by a care manager, usual care plus care management plus a peer-led chronic-disease self-management group program, or usual care plus care management plus a professionally led depression psychotherapy group. Outcomes in intent-to-treat analyses were assessed at three, six, nine, and 12 months and included treatment participation rates, Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale scores, major depression (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV), Patient-Rated Global Improvement ratings, treatment satisfaction, and adequacy of medication.Results: Participation in care management was high in the three intervention groups. Close to 60% of participants invited to both group interventions attended at least an initial meeting, but a greater number assigned to the care management plus the professionally led group continued participation through the 12-month period. The sample was too small to reliably detect small or moderate differences in clinical outcomes, but various measures consistently favored the care management plus professionally led group.Conclusions: It is feasible to direct additional intervention services to patients with persistent or recurring depression. A larger trial of organized self-management support for chronic depression will be necessary for a definitive evaluation of program effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Older adults with low incomes rarely use mental health care, and untreated depression is a serious problem in this population. This study examined whether a collaborative care model for depression in primary care would increase use of depression treatment and treatment outcomes for low-income elderly adults as well as for higher-income older adults.Methods: A multisite randomized clinical trial that included 1,801 adults aged 60 years and older who were diagnosed as having depression compared collaborative care for depression with treatment as usual in primary care. Participants were divided into groups by income definitions on the basis of criteria used by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). A total of 315 participants (18%) were living below the poverty level by the U.S. Census criteria, 261 (15%) were living below 30% of the area median income (AMI) (HUD criteria) but above poverty, 438 (24%) were living between 30% and 50% of the AMI, 327 (18%) were living between 50% and 80% of the AMI, and 460 (26%) were not poor. The income groups were compared on service use, satisfaction, depression severity, and physical health at baseline and at three, six, and 12 months after being randomly assigned to collaborative care or usual care.Results: The benefits for low-income older adults were similar to those for middle- and higher-income older adults. At 12 months, intervention patients in all economic brackets had significantly greater rates of depression care for both antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, greater satisfaction, lower depression severity, and less health-related functional impairment than usual care participants.Conclusions: Lower-income older adults can experience benefits from collaborative management of depression in primary care similar to those of higher-income older adults, although they may require up to a year to reap physical health benefits.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Few data are available concerning the utility of augmentation in late-life depression treatment. The authors examined likelihood, speed, and predictors of recovery in older adults receiving augmentation pharmacotherapy after inadequate response to standardized treatment with paroxetine plus interpersonal psychotherapy. METHOD: Depression levels were monitored during open treatment in 195 adults age 70 or older. Patients were grouped by whether they required augmentation (bupropion, nortriptyline, or lithium) and compared on likelihood, time, and predictors of recovery. RESULTS: Augmentation was required for 105 patients (53.8%) because of inadequate treatment response (N=77) or response followed by relapse (N=28). Of these patients, 69 received augmentation and 36 did not (primarily because of consent withdrawal or comorbid medical conditions). Patients receiving augmentation showed lower recovery rates than patients never requiring augmentation: recovery occurred in 50.0% of patients receiving it because of inadequate response, 66.7% of those receiving it after early relapse, and 86.7% of patients never requiring augmentation. Patients receiving augmentation because of inadequate response recovered more slowly, with modestly more side effects than other patients. Greater medical burden and anxiety predicted slower recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lower likelihood of recovery in elderly people receiving augmentation, the recovery by over one-half of such patients suggests the value of augmentation for those able to tolerate it. Need for augmentation presages slower recovery in patients showing initial inadequate response; those requiring it after early relapse recovered more quickly. Strategies to further improve the likelihood and speed of recovery after initial treatment failure are needed.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Neuroimaging investigations reveal changes in glucose metabolism (fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [PET]) associated with response to disparate antidepressant treatment modalities, including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), antidepressant pharmacotherapies, and deep brain stimulation. Using a nonrandomized design, the authors previously compared changes following CBT or paroxetine in depressed patients. In this study, the authors report changes in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET in responders to CBT or venlafaxine during a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Subjects meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major depressive episode and a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder received a fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan before randomization and after 16 weeks of antidepressant treatment with either CBT (N=12) or venlafaxine (N=12). Modality-specific and modality-independent regional brain metabolic changes associated with response status were analyzed. Results: Response rates were comparable between the CBT (7/12) and venlafaxine (9/12) groups. Response to either treatment modality was associated with decreased glucose metabolism bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex and left medial prefrontal cortex, along with increased metabolism in the right occipital-temporal cortex. Changes in metabolism in the anterior and posterior parts of the subgenual cingulate cortex and the caudate differentiated CBT and venlafaxine responders. Conclusions: Responders to either treatment modality demonstrated reduced metabolism in several prefrontal regions. Consistent with earlier reports, response to CBT was associated with a reciprocal modulation of cortical-limbic connectivity, while venlafaxine engaged additional cortical and striatal regions previously unreported in neuroimaging investigations.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Treatment of major depressive disorder typically entails implementing treatments in a stepwise fashion until a satisfactory outcome is achieved. This study sought to identify factors that affect patients' willingness to accept different second-step treatment approaches. METHOD: Participants in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial who had unsatisfactory outcomes after initial treatment with citalopram were eligible for a randomized second-step treatment trial. An equipoise-stratified design allowed participants to exclude or include specific treatment strategies. Analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with the acceptability of the following second-step treatments: cognitive therapy versus no cognitive therapy, any switch strategy versus any augmentation strategy (including cognitive therapy), and a medication switch strategy only versus a medication augmentation strategy only. RESULTS: Of the 1,439 participants who entered second-step treatment, 1% accepted all treatment strategies, 3% accepted only cognitive therapy, and 26% accepted cognitive therapy (thus, 71% did not accept cognitive therapy). Those with higher educational levels or a family history of a mood disorder were more likely to accept cognitive therapy. Participants in primary care settings and those who experienced a greater side effect burden or a lower reduction in symptom severity with citalopram were more likely to accept a switch strategy as compared with an augmentation strategy. Those with concurrent drug abuse and recurrent major depressive disorder were less likely to accept a switch strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Few participants accepted all treatments. Acceptance of cognitive therapy was primarily associated with sociodemographic characteristics, while acceptance of a treatment switch was associated with the results of the initial treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Although representative payeeship provided within clinical settings is believed to have therapeutic benefits, its potential negative impact on the therapeutic alliance or client-provider relationship is of concern. This study examined the effects of payeeship and perceived financial leverage on positive and negative dimensions of the client-provider relationship.Methods: The sample consisted of 205 adults ages 18 to 65 with axis I disorders who were receiving mental health services from a large urban community mental health clinic. Information about money management characteristics and ratings of the client-provider relationship were collected via face-to-face interview.Results: Fifty-three percent of the sample had a payee or money manager, and 79% of this group had a clinician payee. Respondents with co-occurring psychotic and substance use disorders, lower functioning, and lower insight about their illness were more likely to have a clinician payee. Forty percent of those with a clinician payee reported perceived financial leverage. Having a clinician payee was also associated with perceived financial leverage and with higher levels of conflict in the case management relationship. When examined in combination, financial leverage was found to mediate the effects of payeeship on conflict in the case management relationship (mean+/-SE=2.37+/-1.33, 95% confidence interval=16-5.52, p&lt;.05). That is, payeeship appeared to increase conflict in the therapeutic alliance when used as a source of treatment leverage.Conclusions: Although payeeship provides important support and may enhance functional outcomes for the patient, decisions about using the mechanism for promoting treatment adherence should take into account the potential disruption to the client-provider relationship.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Patients' experiences and satisfaction ratings are increasingly used to evaluate quality of care. This study assessed the extent to which outpatient teams, clinics, and health trusts contributed to patients' experiences and to what extent clinicians' evaluations of quality were related to patients' experiences.Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 15,422 outpatients who attended Norwegian clinics in September 2004; 43% responded. Patients' experiences were measured on an 11-item index and three subscales: outcomes, interaction with clinicians, and information. Aggregated responses from clinicians were linked to the data on patients' experiences. Multilevel analyses were used to divide the variance between the different organizational levels and to assess the relationship with clinicians' opinions and individual-level factors.Results: Data were analyzed for 6,570 outpatients within 222 teams derived from 89 outpatient clinics within 33 health trusts. Differences in patients' scores were determined largely at the patient level, with teams accounting for 2% of the total variance and organizational levels of clinics and health trusts not contributing to patients' experiences. Team-level clinician quality scores were not significantly associated with patients' experiences. Better experiences were significantly associated with patients' female gender, older age, better self-perceived health, absence of an inpatient history, longer treatment episodes, frequent consultations, and waiting times perceived as acceptable.Conclusions: The organizational contributions to patients' experience scores were minimal. Although clinicians' ratings of quality are not a substitute for patients' perceptions of quality, surveys of outpatients' experiences and satisfaction may not be appropriate for cross-sectional comparisons of health care providers.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine differences between structured interviews, symptom questionnaires, and distress measures for assessment of depression in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed 506 diabetic patients for major depressive disorder (MDD) by a structured interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI]), a questionnaire for depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CESD]), and on the Diabetes Distress Scale. Demographic characteristics, two biological variables (A1C and non-HDL cholesterol), and four behavioral management measures (kilocalories, calories of saturated fat, number of fruit and vegetable servings, and minutes of physical activity) were assessed. Comparisons were made between those with and without depression on the CIDI and the CESD. RESULTS: Findings showed that 22% of patients reached CESD &gt;/=16, and 9.9% met a CIDI diagnosis of MDD. Of those above CESD cut points, 70% were not clinically depressed, and 34% of those who were clinically depressed did not reach CESD scores &gt;/=16. Those scoring &gt;/=16, compared with those &lt;16 on the CESD, had higher A1C, kilocalories, and calories of saturated fat and lower physical activity. No differences were found using the CIDI. Diabetes distress was minimally related to MDD but substantively linked to CESD scores and to outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with diabetes and high levels of depressive symptoms are not clinically depressed. The CESD may be more reflective of general emotional and diabetes-specific distress than clinical depression. Most treatment of distress, however, is based on the depression literature, which suggests the need to consider different interventions for distressed but not clinically depressed diabetic patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of housing and neighborhood features on residential instability and the costs of mental health services for individuals with chronic mental illness (CMI). DATA SOURCES: Medicaid and service provider data on the mental health service utilization of 670 individuals with CMI between 1988 and 1993 were combined with primary data on housing attributes and costs, as well as census data on neighborhood characteristics. Study participants were living in independent housing units developed under the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Program on Chronic Mental Illness in four of nine demonstration cities between 1988 and 1993. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were assigned on a first-come, first-served basis to housing units as they became available for occupancy after renovation by the housing providers. Multivariate statistical models are used to examine the relationship between features of the residential environment and three outcomes that were measured during the participant's occupancy in a study property: residential instability, community-based service costs, and hospital-based service costs. To assess cost-effectiveness, the mental health care cost savings associated with some residential features are compared with the cost of providing housing with these features. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Health service utilization data were obtained from Medicaid and from state and local departments of mental health. Non-mental-health services, substance abuse services, and pharmaceuticals were screened out. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Study participants living in newer and properly maintained buildings had lower mental health care costs and residential instability. Buildings with a richer set of amenity features, neighborhoods with no outward signs of physical deterioration, and neighborhoods with newer housing stock were also associated with reduced mental health care costs. Study participants were more residentially stable in buildings with fewer units and where a greater proportion of tenants were other individuals with CMI. Mental health care costs and residential instability tend to be reduced in neighborhoods with many nonresidential land uses and a higher proportion of renters. Mixed-race neighborhoods are associated with reduced probability of mental health hospitalization, but they also are associated with much higher hospitalization costs if hospitalized. The degree of income mixing in the neighborhood has no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Several of the key findings are consistent with theoretical expectations that higher-quality housing and neighborhoods lead to better mental health outcomes among individuals with CMI. The mental health care cost savings associated with these favorable features far outweigh the costs of developing and operating properties with them. Support for the hypothesis that 'diverse-disorganized' neighborhoods are more accepting of individuals with CMI and, hence, associated with better mental health outcomes, is mixed.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study examined a sample of patients in Victoria, Australia, to identify factors in selection for conditional release from an initial hospitalization that occurred within 30 days of entry into the mental health system.Methods: Data were from the Victorian Psychiatric Case Register. All patients first hospitalized and conditionally released between 1990 and 2000 were identified (N=8,879), and three comparison groups were created. Two groups were hospitalized within 30 days of entering the system: those who were given conditional release and those who were not. A third group was conditionally released from a hospitalization that occurred after or extended beyond 30 days after system entry. Logistic regression identified characteristics that distinguished the first group. Ordinary least-squares regression was used to evaluate the contribution of conditional release early in treatment to reducing inpatient episodes, inpatient days, days per episode, and inpatient days per 30 days in the system.Results: Conditional release early in treatment was used for 11 percent of the sample, or more than a third of those who were eligible for this intervention. Factors significantly associated with selection for early conditional release were those related to a better prognosis (initial hospitalization at a later age and having greater than an 11th grade education), a lower likelihood of a diagnosis of dementia or schizophrenia, involuntary status at first inpatient admission, and greater community involvement (being employed and being married). When the analyses controlled for these factors, use of conditional release early in treatment was significantly associated with a reduction in use of subsequent inpatient care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: In order to expand the research base on effective community-based mental health treatments, methods are needed to define and evaluate promising interventions that have not been systematically developed and tested. In this report, the authors describe the results of an effort to better define the wraparound process for children and adolescents with serious emotional and behavioral problems.Methods: A broad review of wraparound treatment manuals and model descriptions was conducted. With the help of a small group of experts, this review was synthesized into an initial description of the phases and activities of the wraparound process. This model was then presented to a multidisciplinary advisory panel of 31 experts on the wraparound process who provided structured and semistructured feedback.Results: Overall, respondents expressed a high level of agreement with the proposed set of activities. For 23 of the 31 activities presented, there was unanimous or near-unanimous agreement (that is, one dissenter) that the activity was an essential component of the wraparound process. For 20 of the 31 activities, there was unanimous agreement that the description was phrased acceptably. A final model was created on the basis of feedback from reviewers.Conclusions: Results indicate that using the experience of a wide base of stakeholders to operationalize a complex model such as wraparound is feasible and holds many potential benefits, including building consensus in the field, improving service quality, and accelerating the incorporation of evaluation results into real-world practice.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: We examined trends in delivery of mental health and substance abuse services at the nation's community health centers. METHODS: Analyses used data from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Care's (BPHC) 1998 and 2003 Uniform Data System, merged with county-level data. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2003, the number of patients diagnosed with a mental health/substance abuse disorder in community health centers increased from 210,000 to 800,000. There was an increase in the number of patients per specialty mental health/substance abuse treatment provider and a decline in the mean number of patient visits, from 7.3 visits per patient to 3.5 by 2003. Although most community health centers had some on-site mental health/substance abuse services, centers without on-site services were more likely to be located in counties with fewer mental health/substance abuse clinicians, psychiatric emergency rooms, and inpatient hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Community health centers are playing an increasingly central role in providing mental health/substance abuse treatment services in the United States. It is critical both to ensure that these centers have adequate resources for providing mental health/substance abuse care and that they develop effective linkages with mental health/substance abuse clinicians in the communities they serve.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to examine the relationship between youth-reported asthma symptoms, presence of anxiety or depressive disorders, and objective measures of asthma severity among a population-based sample of youth with asthma. METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey of 767 youth with asthma (aged 11-17 years) enrolled in a staff model health maintenance organization. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to diagnose Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, anxiety and depressive disorders; the Child Health Status-Asthma questionnaire (modified) was used to assess asthma symptoms; and automated administrative data were used to measure asthma treatment intensity and severity. Analyses of covariance were performed to determine whether the number of anxiety and depressive symptoms was related to the number of asthma symptoms. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the strength of association between individual symptoms of asthma and the presence of an anxiety or depressive disorder and objective measures of asthma severity. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic characteristics, objective measures of asthma severity, medical comorbidity, and asthma treatment intensity, youth with &gt; or = 1 anxiety or depressive disorder (N = 125) reported significantly more days of asthma symptoms over the previous 2 weeks than youth with no anxiety or depressive disorders. The overall number of reported asthma symptoms was significantly associated with the number of anxiety and depressive symptoms endorsed by youth. In logistic regression analyses, having an anxiety or depressive disorder was also strongly associated with each of the 6 asthma-specific symptoms, as well as the 5 related nonspecific somatic symptoms contained in the Child Health Status-Asthma questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of an anxiety or depressive disorder is highly associated with increased asthma symptom burden for youth with asthma.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: To improve interventions for depressed older adults, data are needed on the comparative effects of pharmacotherapy versus psychotherapy. Given that most older adults with clinically significant depressive symptoms do not have major depression, data on treatments for minor depression and dysthymia are especially needed. METHOD: Meta-analysis was used to integrate the results of 89 controlled studies of treatments focused on acute major depression (37 studies) and other depressive disorders (52 studies conducted with mixed diagnostic groups, including patients with major depression, minor depression, and dysthymia). A total of 5,328 older adults received pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy in these studies. RESULTS: Clinician-rated depression scores improved, on average, by 0.80 standard deviation (SD) units; self-rated depression scores improved by 0.76 SD units. Clinician-rated depression improved by 0.69 SD units in pharmacotherapeutic studies and by 1.09 SD units in psychotherapeutic studies. Self-rated depression improved by 0.62 SD units and 0.83 SD units, respectively. An interesting finding was the stronger improvements in clinician-rated depression among control subjects participating in medication studies, compared to those in psychotherapeutic studies. CONCLUSIONS: Available treatments for depression work, with effect sizes that are moderate to large. Comparisons of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy must be interpreted with caution, in part because medication studies are more likely to use a credible active placebo, which may lead to smaller adjusted effect sizes in medication studies. Given that psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy did not show strong differences in effect sizes, treatment choice should be based on other criteria, such as contraindications, treatment access, or patient preferences.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents is underrecognized and undertreated despite its poor long-term outcomes, including risk for suicide. Primary care settings may be critical venues for the identification of depression, but there is little information about the usefulness of primary care interventions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the evidence for the treatment of depression in primary care settings, focusing on evidence concerning psychosocial, educational, and/or supportive intervention strategies. METHODS: Available data on brief psychosocial treatments for adolescent depression in primary settings were reviewed. Given the paucity of direct studies, we also drew on related literature to summarize available evidence whether brief, psychosocial support from a member of the primary care team, with or without medication, might improve depression outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 37 studies relevant to treating adolescent depression in primary care settings. Only 4 studies directly examined the impact of primary care-delivered psychosocial interventions for adolescent depression, but they suggest that such interventions can be effective. Indirect evidence from other psychosocial/behavioral interventions, including anticipatory guidance and efforts to enhance treatment adherence, and adult depression studies also show benefits of primary care-delivered interventions as well as the impact of provider training to enhance psychosocial skills. CONCLUSIONS: There is potential for successful treatment of adolescent depression in primary care, in view of evidence that brief, psychosocial support, with or without medication, has been shown to improve a range of outcomes, including adolescent depression itself. Given the great public health problem posed by adolescent depression, the likelihood that most depressed adolescents will not receive specialty services, and new guidelines for managing adolescent depression in primary care, clinicians may usefully consider initiation of supportive interventions in their primary care practices.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the second of the two core questions around which the ACCESS (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports) evaluation was designed: Does better integration of service systems improve the treatment outcomes of homeless persons with severe mental illness? METHODS: The ACCESS program provided technical support and about $250,000 a year for four years to nine sites to implement strategies to promote systems integration. These sites, along with nine comparison sites, also received funds to support outreach and assertive community treatment programs to assist 100 clients a year at each site. Outcome data were obtained at baseline and three and 12 months later from 7,055 clients across four annual cohorts at all sites. RESULTS: Clients at all sites demonstrated improvement in outcome measures. However, the clients at the experimental sites showed no greater improvement on measures of mental health or housing outcomes across the four cohorts than those at the comparison sites. More extensive implementation of systems integration strategies was unrelated to these outcomes. However, clients of sites that became more integrated, regardless of the degree of implementation or whether the sites were experimental sites or comparison sites, had progressively better housing outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions designed to increase the level of systems integration in the ACCESS demonstration did not result in better client outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate the detection rate by general practitioners (GPs) of mental disorders in a primary health care setting and relating the findings to selected GP characteristics and the patient sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: The patients were assessed with respect to mental disorders by Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 (HSCL-25), and the GPs were independently asked to fill in the Goldberg checklist II to assess the patient after consultation. The sample consisted of 10 primary health care clinics in the Gaza Strip, which were randomly selected from the five regions that form the Gaza Strip (Northern, Southern region, Gaza City, Middle region, Khan-Younis and Rafah). Thirty-two GPs and 661 patients participated in the study. RESULTS: The study showed that the GPs detected only 11.6 per cent of patients with mental disorders at HSCL-25 score &gt;1.75, and that the GP's assessment was not significantly associated with the HSCL-25 scores. GPs with postgraduate psychiatric training performed better in detecting mental disorders, likewise female GPs and those who were more than 40 years old. The results also revealed that the GPs were more able to detect mental disorders among patients older than 25 years, and in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: The GPs' poor detection rate of mental disorders indicates the importance of mental health training for GPs working in primary health care clinics.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This study describes the existence and nature of services within state child and adult mental health systems that support the transition from adolescence to adulthood.Methods: State child and adult mental health administrators from all but one state were interviewed by telephone with a semistructured questionnaire regarding transition services in their state mental health system, such as supported housing, vocational support, preparation for independent living, and dual diagnosis treatment. Eight states were deemed sufficiently decentralized to render state-level administrator reports invalid. Specific service data from the remaining 41 states and the District of Columbia were analyzed with descriptive statistics.Results: One-quarter of child state mental health systems and one-half of adult state mental health systems offered no transition services, and few provided any kind of transition service at more than one site. Most types of transition services were available at all in less than 20 percent of the states.Conclusions: Across the United States transition support services are lacking. The adult system in particular will require major transformation to provide the service capacity that is needed to meet the current standards of transition service accessibility for young Americans with serious mental health conditions.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: In controlled treatment trials, 40%-60% of unmedicated depressed individuals respond to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The authors examined whether pretreatment neural reactivity to emotional stimuli accounted for this variation. METHOD: Unmedicated depressed individuals (N=14) and never depressed comparison subjects (N=21) underwent fMRI during performance of a task sensitive to sustained emotional information processing. Afterward, depressed participants completed 16 sessions of CBT. RESULTS: Participants whose sustained reactivity to emotional stimuli was low in the subgenual cingulate cortex (Brodmann's area 25) and high in the amygdala displayed the strongest improvement with CBT. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of emotion regulation disruptions, which are targeted in CBT, may be the key to recovery with this intervention.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Psychotherapy has long been recognized as a key component of psychiatric care. However, concerns have been raised about access to psychotherapy as a result of changes in the financing and management of care. This study examined patterns and predictors of receipt of psychotherapy among patients of psychiatrists. METHODS: Data were collected for 587 psychiatrists who participated in the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education's Practice Research Network 1999 Study of Psychiatric Patients and Treatments, which generated nationally representative data for 1,589 adult patients. RESULTS: Findings indicate that more than 66 percent of patients of psychiatrists received some form of psychotherapy from the psychiatrist or another provider in the past 30 days--56 percent from their psychiatrist and 10 percent from another clinician. Although 72 percent of patients with depression received psychotherapy, more than half of those with schizophrenia did not. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients of psychiatrists received psychotherapy from their psychiatrist. However, these rates varied by demographic, diagnostic, and health plan characteristics and by practice setting. Further research determining if these observed patterns of psychotherapy are related to differential outcomes is needed.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors studied recurrent problems in psychotherapy with suicidal patients by examining the cases of patients who died by suicide while receiving open-ended psychotherapy and medication. METHOD: Therapists for 36 patients who died by suicide while in treatment filled out clinical, medication, and psychological questionnaires and wrote detailed case narratives. They then presented their cases at an all-day workshop, and critical problems were identified in the cases. RESULTS: Six recurrent problem areas were identified: poor communication with another therapist involved in the case, permitting patients or relatives to control the therapy, avoidance of issues related to sexuality, ineffective or coercive actions resulting from the therapist's anxieties about a patient's potential suicide, not recognizing the meaning of the patient's communications, and untreated or undertreated symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These cases illuminate common problems therapists face in working with suicidal patients and highlight an unmet need for education of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who work with this population.</ab>

        <ab>The authors provide an overview of the ACCESS program (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports), which evaluated the integration of service systems and its impact on outcomes for homeless persons with severe mental illness. The ACCESS program provided funds and technical assistance to nine community sites to implement strategies for system change that would promote systems integration. These experimental sites, along with nine comparison sites, also received funds to support outreach and assertive community treatment for 100 clients a year for four years at each site. Data on the implementation of system change strategies were collected from 1994 to 1998 during annual visits to the sites. Data on changes in systems integration were obtained from interviews with key informants from relevant organizations in each community. Client outcome data were obtained at program entry and three and 12 months later from 7,055 program participants across the four annual client cohorts at all sites. Detailed findings from the ACCESS evaluation are presented in two accompanying articles, and overall conclusions are offered in a fourth article.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVES: This study tested a psychiatric rehabilitation approach for organizing and delivering services to street-dwelling persons with severe mental illness. METHODS: Street-dwelling persons with severe mental illness were randomly assigned to the experimental program (called Choices) or to standard treatment in New York City. We assessed study participants at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 24 months, using measures of service use, quality of life, health, mental health, and social psychological status. The average deviation from baseline summary statistic was employed to assess change. RESULTS: Compared with persons in standard treatment (n = 77), members of the experimental group (n = 91) were more likely to attend a day program (53% vs 27%), had less difficulty in meeting their basic needs, spent less time on the streets (55% vs 28% reduction), and spent more time in community housing (21% vs 9% increase). They showed greater improvement in life satisfaction and experienced a greater reduction in psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: With an appropriate service model, it is possible to engage disaffiliated populations, expand their use of human services, and improve their housing conditions, quality of life, and mental health status.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders frequently have a history of interpersonal violence, and past research has suggested that they are not served effectively by the current service system. The goal of the Women, Co-occurring Disorders, and Violence Study was to develop and test the effectiveness of new service approaches specifically designed for these women. METHODS: A quasi-experimental treatment outcome study was conducted from 2001 to 2003 at nine sites. Although intervention specifics such as treatment length and modality varied across sites, each site used a comprehensive, integrated, trauma-informed, and consumer-involved approach to treatment. Substance use problem severity, mental health symptoms, and trauma symptoms were measured at baseline, and follow-up data were analyzed with prospective meta-analysis and hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: A total of 2,026 women had data at the 12-month follow-up: 1,018 in the intervention group and 1,008 in the usual-care group. For substance use outcomes, no effect was found. The meta-analysis demonstrated small but statistically significant overall improvement in women's trauma and mental health symptoms in the intervention relative to the usual-care comparison condition. Analysis of key program elements demonstrated that integrating substance abuse, mental health, and trauma-related issues into counseling yielded greater improvement, whereas the delivery of numerous core services yielded less improvement relative to the comparison group. A few person-level characteristics were associated with increases or decreases in the intervention effect. These neither moderated nor supplanted the effects of integrated counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes for women with co-occurring disorders and a history of violence and trauma may improve with integrated treatment.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The authors examine national patterns in psychotherapy for older adults with a diagnosis of depression and analyze correlates of psychotherapy use that is consistent with Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines for duration of treatment.Method: Linked Medicare claims and survey data from the 1992-1999 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey were used. The data were merged with the Area Resource File to assess the effect of provider-supply influences on psychotherapy treatment. An episode-of-care framework approach was used to analyze psychotherapy use and treatment duration. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to predict psychotherapy use and its consistency.Results: The authors identified 2,025 episodes of depression treatment between 1992 and 1999. Overall, psychotherapy was used in 25% (N=474) of the episodes, with 68% of episodes with psychotherapy involving services received only from psychiatrists. (Percentages were weighted for the complex design of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.) Use of psychotherapy was correlated with younger patient age, higher patient educational attainment, and availability of local psychotherapy providers. Among episodes in which psychotherapy was used, only a minority (33%, N=141) involved patients who remained in consistent treatment, defined as extending for at least two-thirds of the episode of depression. Availability of local providers was positively correlated with consistent psychotherapy use. In analyses with adjustment for provider-related factors, patients' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics did not affect the odds of receiving consistent psychotherapy.Conclusions: Use of psychotherapy remains uncommon among depressed older adults despite its widely acknowledged efficacy. Some of the disparities in psychotherapy utilization suggest supply-side barriers. Increasing the geographic availability of mental health care providers may be one way of increasing access to psychotherapy for depressed older adults.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Burgeoning global mental health endeavors have renewed debates about cultural applicability of psychiatric categories. This study's goal is to review strengths and limitations of literature comparing psychiatric categories with cultural concepts of distress (CCD) such as cultural syndromes, culture-bound syndromes, and idioms of distress.Methods: The Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) was adapted based on cultural psychiatry principles to develop a Cultural Psychiatry Epidemiology version (SAQOR-CPE), which was used to rate quality of quantitative studies comparing CCD and psychiatric categories. A meta-analysis was performed for each psychiatric category.Results: Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria, with 18 782 unique participants. Primary objectives of the studies included comparing CCD and psychiatric disorders (51%), assessing risk factors for CCD (18%) and instrument validation (16%). Only 27% of studies met SAQOR-CPE criteria for medium quality, with the remainder low or very low quality. Only 29% of studies employed representative samples, 53% used validated outcome measures, 44% included function assessments and 44% controlled for confounding. Meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, PTSD and somatization revealed high heterogeneity (I(2) &gt; 75%). Only general psychological distress had low heterogeneity (I(2) = 8%) with a summary effect odds ratio of 5.39 (95% CI 4.71-6.17). Associations between CCD and psychiatric disorders were influenced by methodological issues, such as validation designs (β = 16.27, 95%CI 12.75-19.79) and use of CCD multi-item checklists (β = 6.10, 95%CI 1.89-10.31). Higher quality studies demonstrated weaker associations of CCD and psychiatric disorders.Conclusions: Cultural concepts of distress are not inherently unamenable to epidemiological study. However, poor study quality impedes conceptual advancement and service application. With improved study design and reporting using guidelines such as the SAQOR-CPE, CCD research can enhance detection of mental health problems, reduce cultural biases in diagnostic criteria and increase cultural salience of intervention trial outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Previous reports demonstrating quality-of-life impairment in anxiety and affective disorders have relied upon epidemiological samples or relatively small clinical studies. Administration of the same quality-of-life scale, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, to subjects entering multiple large-scale trials for depression and anxiety disorders allowed us to compare the impact of these disorders on quality of life. METHOD: Baseline Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, demographic, and clinical data from 11 treatment trials, including studies of major depressive disorder, chronic/double depression, dysthymic disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with clinically severe impairment (two or more standard deviations below the community norm) in quality of life varied with different diagnoses: major depressive disorder (63%), chronic/double depression (85%), dysthymic disorder (56%), panic disorder (20%), OCD (26%), social phobia (21%), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (31%), and PTSD (59%). Regression analyses conducted for each disorder suggested that illness-specific symptom scales were significantly associated with baseline quality of life but explained only a small to modest proportion of the variance in Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire scores. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with affective or anxiety disorders who enter clinical trials have significant quality-of-life impairment, although the degree of dysfunction varies. Diagnostic-specific symptom measures explained only a small proportion of the variance in quality of life, suggesting that an individual's perception of quality of life is an additional factor that should be part of a complete assessment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: A paucity of studies use nonpharmacological strategies for preventing recurrence in depression. Cognitive behavior treatment of residual symptoms was found to yield a significantly lower relapse rate than clinical management in recurrent depression at a 2-year follow-up. The objective of this investigation was to provide a 6-year follow-up of cognitive behavior treatment versus clinical management. METHOD: Forty patients with recurrent major depression who had been successfully treated with antidepressant drugs were randomly assigned to either cognitive behavior treatment of residual symptoms (supplemented by lifestyle modification and well-being therapy) or clinical management. In both groups, antidepressant drugs were tapered and discontinued. A 6-year follow-up was undertaken. During this period, no antidepressant drugs were used unless a relapse ensued. RESULTS: Cognitive behavior treatment resulted in a significantly lower relapse rate (40%) at a 6-year follow-up than did clinical management (90%). When multiple recurrences were considered, the group that received cognitive behavior treatment had a significantly lower number of relapses in comparison with the clinical management group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the sequential use of cognitive behavior treatment after pharmacotherapy may improve the long-term outcome in recurrent depression. A significant proportion of patients with recurrent depression might be able to withdraw from medication successfully and to stay well for at least 6 years with a focused course of psychotherapy.</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an important and common cause of insomnia, and previous studies indicate that psychiatric wellbeing may be impaired among RLS patients. We aimed to investigate the interaction between anxiety/depression and RLS in a population based survey.Methods: Data were drawn from the Mersin University Neuro-Epidemiology Project, a representative community sample of adults aged over 17 years residing in Mersin (n = 3234). Subjects found to be positive for RLS (n = 103) were evaluated for symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scales and compared with the same number of contemporaneous control subjects.Results: Significantly greater anxiety and depression symptoms were observed among patients with RLS than in the control subjects. Our data also seem to provide initial evidence of a correlation between the severity of RLS and of anxiety and depression symptoms (r = 0.21, p = 0.03 and r = 0.201, p = 0.04 respectively).Conclusions: Assessment of psychiatric status of RLS patients can be helpful and sometimes necessary to determine additional features and treatment strategies of this bothering condition. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings using longitudinal data.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Motivated by the public health importance of major depression and calls to study the effectiveness of treatments frequently used in routine practice, the authors characterized the usual outpatient care of acute-phase major depression in a privately insured population as well as the effectiveness of this care. METHOD: Upon identifying frequent antidepressant interventions from a large administrative database spanning the years 1991-1996, and after completing an exhaustive review of published efficacy evidence, the authors undertook a two-stage elicitation process. A panel of 10 experts estimated probabilities of symptom-based outcomes for 120 combinations of treatment, provider type, and patient characteristics seen in 9,054 depressive episodes. The 10 most frequent treatments, utilized in 90% of the episodes, are reported here. RESULTS: A short course of psychotherapy delivered by specialists to healthy premenopausal women was the most frequent pattern of care. Only two prevalent treatments had adequate evidence. On the basis of expert-estimated rates of remission (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score &lt;8), response (score &lt;13), and no change (score &gt;/=18), three of the 10 most frequent treatments were highly effective, two were moderately effective, and five were minimally effective. CONCLUSIONS: Although experts gave high marks to three commonly used treatments, the expert-estimated effectiveness for this particular system of care was quite modest. More research is needed on the outcomes associated with specific usual care practices as well as the contributors to ineffective care.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Antenatal depression is a significant risk factor for postpartum depression, with a 10%-12% prevalence in all pregnancies. Rates of depression are higher for pregnant women with chronic stressors, financial and housing problems, and inadequate social support. Despite the prevalence and associated family and infant morbidity, there are no controlled clinical treatment trials regarding this topic, to the authors' knowledge. APA has identified treatment of depression during pregnancy as a priority for clinical guidelines. METHOD: A 16-week bilingual controlled clinical trial compared a group receiving interpersonal psychotherapy for antepartum depression to a parenting education control program. Fifty outpatient antepartum women who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy or a didactic parenting education program. Thirty-eight women remained in the study and were included in the data analysis. Depressed mood was measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Hamilton depression scale measured recovery. RESULTS: The interpersonal psychotherapy treatment group showed significant improvement compared to the parenting education control program on all three measures of mood at termination. Recovery criteria were met in 60% of the women treated with interpersonal psychotherapy, according to a CGI score of &lt; or = 2. In addition, there was a significant correlation between maternal mood and mother-infant interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Interpersonal psychotherapy is an effective method of antidepressant treatment during pregnancy and should be a first-line treatment in the hierarchy of treatment for antepartum depression.</ab>

        <ab>Alcoholism and nicotine dependence share many neurobiological underpinnings; the presence of one drug can cause a person to crave the other. Depressive illness can complicate comorbid alcohol and nicotine dependence by exacerbating the negative affect encountered during attempts to abstain from one or both drugs. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with cigarette smoking, it is imperative to identify treatments to promote smoking cessation and address comorbid psychiatric conditions contemporaneously. Pharmacotherapeutic options demonstrating varying degrees of efficacy and promise in preclinical and clinical studies include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion, varenicline, tricyclic antidepressants, and bupropion plus NRT. Topiramate has shown potential for promoting smoking cessation in alcoholics, although its safety in depressed patients has not been fully explored. The efficacy of medications for treating nicotine dependence is generally enhanced by the inclusion of behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy. When group cohesion and social support are stressed, success rates increase among depressed smokers undergoing smoking cessation treatment. Additional treatment strategies targeting dually dependent individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders, including special populations such as women and adolescents, await further investigation.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: We sought to compare symptoms of depression and anxiety as predictors of incomplete recovery after a first myocardial infarction (MI).Background: Depressive symptoms have been related to post-MI mortality and health care consumption, but little is known about the effect of anxiety. We wanted to examine the effect of emotional distress on health care consumption and whether depressive symptomatology is a better predictor of prognosis than anxiety.Methods: Subjects were 318 men (mean age 58 years) who completed the depression, anxiety, and hostility scales from the 90-item symptom check list after they survived a first MI.Results: After an average follow-up of 3.4 years, there were 25 cardiac events (fatal or non-fatal MI). Symptoms of both depression (hazard ratio [HR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 5.18; p = 0.039) and anxiety (HR 3.01, 95% CI 1.20 to 7.60; p = 0.019) were associated with cardiac events, adjusting for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and use of antidepressants. However, a multivariate analysis including all three negative emotions indicated that symptoms of anxiety (HR 2.79, 95% CI 1.11 to 7.03; p = 0.029) explained away the relationship between depressive symptoms and cardiac events. Regarding health care consumption, anxiety (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.22; p = 0.005), but not depression/hostility, was a predictor of cardiac rehospitalization and frequent visits at the cardiac outpatient clinic.Conclusions: Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with cardiac events. Anxiety was an independent predictor of both cardiac events and increased health care consumption and accounted for the relationship between depressive symptoms and prognosis. Symptoms of anxiety need to be considered in the risk stratification and treatment of post-MI patients.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors compared treatment and outcomes for depressed primary care patients with and without comorbid medical conditions and assessed the impact of quality improvement programs for these patients. METHOD: The study group included 1,356 patients with major depression, dysthymia, or subthreshold depression from 46 managed primary care clinics. Clinics were randomly assigned depression treatment programs consisting of usual care for depression or one of two quality improvement programs for depression. The quality improvement programs included training experts and nurse specialists to provide education and assessment, plus access to nurse specialists for medication follow-up or access to psychotherapists. Outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At 6- and 12-month follow-up, the likelihood of having a probable depressive disorder was higher, but the rates of use of antidepressant medication and specialty counseling were similar, for depressed patients with comorbid medical disorders than for depressed patients who did not have comorbid medical disorders. Among the depressed patients with comorbid medical disorders, the combined quality improvement programs resulted in greater use of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy and lower rates of probable depressive disorders at both 6- and 12-month follow-up than did the usual care depression treatment program. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed patients with comorbid medical disorders tend to have similar rates of treatment but worse depression outcomes than depressed patients without comorbid medical illness. Quality improvement programs for depression can improve treatment rates and outcomes for depressed primary care patients with comorbid medical illness. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for clinical practice.</ab>

        <ab>The authors describe the rationale for implementing evidence-based practices in routine mental health service settings. Evidence-based practices are interventions for which there is scientific evidence consistently showing that they improve client outcomes. Despite extensive evidence and agreement on effective mental health practices for persons with severe mental illness, research shows that routine mental health programs do not provide evidence-based practices to the great majority of their clients with these illnesses. The authors define the differences between evidence-based practices and related concepts, such as guidelines and algorithms. They discuss common concerns about the use of evidence-based practices, such as whether ethical values have a role in shaping such practices and how to deal with clinical situations for which no scientific evidence exists.</ab>

        <ab>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral approach to treating borderline personality disorder. Early empirical results are promising, although they are not sufficient to establish DBT as an evidence-based practice in community settings. Nevertheless, the treatment has been widely implemented by mental health authorities, program leaders, and clinicians. The authors describe DBT's four stages of treatment, the functional areas addressed, and the treatment modes used as well as the reasons for the appeal of DBT to practitioners. They review barriers encountered by those who have implemented the model and present strategies that have been developed to overcome the barriers.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is a mental health condition which affects millions of people each year, with worldwide rates increasing. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is recommended in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the treatment of depression. However, waiting lists can cause delays for face-to-face therapy. Also a proportion of people decline to present for help through the health service - the so-called treatment gap. Self-referral to CBT using community-based group interventions delivered by a voluntary sector organization may serve to resolve this problem. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the efficacy of such a guided CBT self-help course, the 'Living Life to the Full' (LLTTF) classes delivered by the charity Action on Depression (AOD). The primary outcome is level of depression at 6 months assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) depression scale. Secondary measures include levels of anxiety and social functioning.Methods/design: Participants with symptoms of low mood will be recruited from the community through newspaper adverts and also via the AOD website. Participants will receive either immediate or delayed access to guided CBT self-help classes - the eight session LLTTF course. The primary endpoint will be at 6 months at which point the delayed group will be offered the intervention. Levels of depression, anxiety and social functioning will be assessed and an economic analysis will be carried out.Discussion: This RCT will test whether the LLTTF intervention is effective and/or cost-effective. If the LLTTF community-based classes are found to be cost effective, they may be helpful as both an intervention for those already seeking care in the health service, as well as those seeking help outside that setting, widening access to psychological therapy.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN86292664.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether there were differences in the rate of depressive and anxiety disorders between HIV-infected women (N=93) and a comparison group of uninfected women (N=62). Secondary objectives were to examine correlates of depression in HIV-infected women-including HIV disease stage and protease inhibitor use-and the associations between symptoms of depression or anxiety and other potential predictor variables. METHOD: Subjects underwent extensive semiannual clinical, psychiatric, neuropsychological, and immunological evaluations. Depressive and anxiety disorder diagnoses were assessed by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (the 17-item version and a modified 11-item version) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, respectively. RESULTS: The rate of current major depressive disorder was four times higher in HIV-seropositive women (19.4%) than in HIV-seronegative women (4.8%). Mean depressive symptom scores on the 17-item Hamilton depression scale also were significantly higher, overall, in the HIV-infected women (mean=8.7, SD=8.0) relative to comparison subjects (mean=3.3, SD=5.8). There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of anxiety disorders. However, HIV-seropositive women had significantly higher anxiety symptom scores (mean=8.8, SD=8.9) than did HIV-seronegative women (mean=3.6, SD=5.5). Both groups had similar substance abuse/dependence histories, but adjusting for this factor had little impact on the relationship of HIV status to current major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-seropositive women without current substance abuse exhibited a significantly higher rate of major depressive disorder and more symptoms of depression and anxiety than did a group of HIV-seronegative women with similar demographic characteristics. These controlled, clinical findings extend recent epidemiologic findings and underscore the importance of adequate assessment and treatment of depression and anxiety in HIV-infected women.</ab>

        <ab>In mental health practice, a commonly held view is that therapist self-disclosure should be discouraged and its dangers closely monitored. Changes in medicine, mental health care, and society demand reexamination of these beliefs. In some clinical situations, considerable benefit may stem from therapist self-disclosure. Although the dangers of boundary violations are genuine, self-disclosure may be underused or misused because it lacks a framework. It is useful to consider the benefits of self-disclosure in the context of treatment type, treatment setting, and patient characteristics. Self-disclosure can contribute to the effectiveness of peer models. Self-disclosure is often used in cognitive-behavioral therapy and social skills training and might be useful in psychopharmacologic and supportive treatments. The unavoidable self-disclosure that occurs in non-office-based settings provides opportunities for therapeutic deliberate self-disclosure. Children and individuals who have a diminished capacity for abstract thought may benefit from more direct answers to questions related to self-disclosure. The role of self-disclosure in mental health care should be reexamined.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The delivery of appropriate treatment to persons who have mental and substance use disorders is of increasing concern to clinicians, administrators, and policy makers. This study sought to describe use of appropriate mental health and comprehensive substance abuse care among adults in the United States with probable co-occurring disorders. METHODS: Data from the Healthcare for Communities survey, which is based on a national household sample studied in 1997 and 1998, were used to identify individuals who had probable co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of these individuals and their use of services were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with receipt of mental health and substance abuse treatment and with receipt of appropriate treatment. RESULTS: Estimates for the U.S. adult population based on the weighted survey data indicated that 3 percent of the population had co-occurring disorders. Seventy-two percent did not receive any specialty mental health or substance abuse treatment in the previous 12 months; only 8 percent received both specialty mental health care and specialty substance abuse treatment. Only 23 percent received appropriate mental health care, and 9 percent received supplemental substance abuse treatment. Perceived need for treatment was strongly associated with receipt of any mental health care and with receipt of appropriate care. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of effective treatments, most individuals who had co-occurring mental health and substance use problems were not receiving effective treatment. Efforts to improve the care provided to persons who have co-occurring disorders should focus on strategies that increase the delivery of effective treatment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal, nonexperimental study examined whether depression treatment provided in concordance with guidelines developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is associated with improved clinical outcomes. METHODS: The medical, insurance, and pharmacy records of a community-based sample of 435 subjects who screened positive for current major depression were abstracted to ascertain whether depression treatment was received and whether it was provided in accordance with AHRQ guidelines. Regression analyses estimated the impact of guideline-concordant treatment on the change in depression severity and on mental and physical health over a six-month period. An instrumental variables analysis was used to check the sensitivity of the results to selection bias. RESULTS: A total of 106 subjects were treated for depression by 105 different primary care and specialty providers. Sixty percent of the sample had current major depression, and about 40 percent had subthreshold depression. Only 29 percent of the patients received guideline-concordant treatment. For patients with major depression, guideline-concordant care was significantly and substantially associated with improved depression severity but not with improvements in overall mental or physical health. The instrumental variables analysis indicated that the standard regression analysis underestimated the treatment effect by 21 percent. For those with subthreshold depression, guideline-concordant care was not associated with improved outcomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This community-based, nonexperimental study found a positive relationship between the quality of care for depression and clinical outcomes for patients with major depression in routine practice settings.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study presents data on the use of complementary and alternative therapies to treat anxiety and depression in the United States. METHOD: The data came from a nationally representative survey of 2,055 respondents (1997-1998) that obtained information on the use of 24 complementary and alternative therapies for the treatment of specific chronic conditions. RESULTS: A total of 9.4% of the respondents reported suffering from 'anxiety attacks' in the past 12 months; 7.2% reported 'severe depression.' A total of 56.7% of those with anxiety attacks and 53.6% of those with severe depression reported using complementary and alternative therapies to treat these conditions during the past 12 months. Only 20.0% of those with anxiety attacks and 19.3% of those with severe depression visited a complementary or alternative therapist. A total of 65.9% of the respondents seen by a conventional provider for anxiety attacks and 66.7% of those seen by a conventional provider for severe depression also used complementary and alternative therapies to treat these conditions. The perceived helpfulness of these therapies in treating anxiety and depression was similar to that of conventional therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies are used more than conventional therapies by people with self-defined anxiety attacks and severe depression. Most patients visiting conventional mental health providers for these problems also use complementary and alternative therapies. Use of these therapies will likely increase as insurance coverage expands. Asking patients about their use could prevent adverse effects and maximize the usefulness of therapies subsequently proven to be effective.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The authors determined the frequency of anxiety disorders in a large group of depressed outpatients seeking treatment. METHOD: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was administered to 373 depressed outpatients. RESULTS: More than one-half of the patients met the full criteria for a current anxiety disorder, and more than one-half of the patients with an anxiety disorder had more than one. When partial remissions and anxiety disorder diagnoses classified as 'not otherwise specified' were included, two-thirds of the patients had a current anxiety disorder and three-quarters had a lifetime history of an anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with a principal diagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder have a comorbid anxiety disorder. Because antidepressant medications have differential efficacies for anxiety disorders, knowledge of the presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder in a depressed patient may have treatment implications.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis-specific, proven efficacious treatments are a major recent advance in psychiatry. Appropriate use of such treatments presupposes patients who meet the diagnostic criteria and clinicians who have accurately diagnosed the target disorder and comorbid conditions. Since little is known about whether these prerequisites are commonly met, the authors conducted a study at two community treatment sites to determine the frequency of various axis I diagnoses and the concordance between the diagnoses recorded in patient charts and those obtained by a structured interview. Given that a DSM diagnosis may not be sufficient to understand a patient's problems, the authors also obtained ratings of interpersonal functioning. METHOD: The subjects were 164 nonpsychotic patients who were seen at a rural (N=114) or urban (N=50) community treatment facility. Raters trained to reliably use the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) conducted diagnostic interviews. Clinical charts were reviewed to obtain clinical diagnoses. Patients completed questionnaires regarding interpersonal functioning. RESULTS: Most (N=145, 88%) of the patients met the SCID criteria for a current axis I diagnosis, and 53% (N=87) met the criteria for two or more disorders. Clinical and SCID diagnoses had poor agreement. Evidence was found for interpersonal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients met the diagnostic criteria for conditions for which there are proven treatments; however, inaccurate diagnosis proved common. This barrier to optimal treatment could be ameliorated with the use of structured interviews for common diagnoses. Scores on social/interpersonal measures support the premise that DSM symptoms provide only part of the relevant information about patients' conditions.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The study examined the effectiveness of an outreach intervention designed to increase access to mental health treatment among veterans disabled by chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and identified patient-reported barriers to care associated with failure to seek the treatment offered. METHODS: Participants were 594 male Vietnam veterans who were not enrolled in mental health care at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center but who were receiving VA disability benefits for PTSD. Half the sample was randomly assigned to an outreach intervention, and the other half was assigned to a control group. Veterans in the intervention group received a mailing that included a brochure describing PTSD treatment available at an urban VA medical center, along with a letter informing them about how to access care. Participants in the intervention group were subsequently telephoned by a study coordinator who encouraged them to enroll in PTSD treatment and who administered a survey assessing barriers to care. RESULTS: Veterans in the intervention group were significantly more likely than those in the control group to schedule an intake appointment (28 percent versus 7 percent), attend the intake (23 percent versus 7 percent), and enroll in treatment (19 percent versus 6 percent). Several patient-identified barriers were associated with failure to seek VA mental health care, such as personal obligations that prevented clinic attendance, inconvenient clinic hours, and current receipt of mental health treatment from a non-VA provider. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of mental health services among underserved veterans with PTSD can be increased by an inexpensive outreach intervention, which may be useful with other chronically mentally ill populations.</ab>

        <ab>Psychological distress often causes suffering in terminally ill patients and their families and poses challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Increased attention to diagnosis and treatment of depression can improve the coping mechanisms of patients and families. This paper reviews the clinical characteristics of normal grief and clinical depression and explains strategies for differential diagnosis. Although some literature discusses the psychological issues facing elderly patients and terminally ill patients with cancer, less is known about patients with end-stage pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and neurologic disease. Data on the effectiveness of interventions in terminally ill patients are lacking. Treatment recommendations in this paper represent extrapolations from existing literature and expert opinion. Diagnosing and treating depression in terminally ill patients involve unique challenges. Evidence of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt, and suicidal ideation are better indicators of depression in this context than neurovegetative symptoms. Although terminally ill patients often have suicidal thoughts, they are usually fleeting. Sustained suicidal ideation should prompt a comprehensive evaluation. Clinicians should have a low threshold for treating depression in terminally ill patients. Psychostimulants, because of their rapid onset of action, are useful agents and are generally well tolerated. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants may also be used. Psychological interventions-including eliciting concerns and conveying the potential for connection, meaning, reconciliation, and closure in the dying process-can also facilitate coping.</ab>

        <ab>This column describes a Michigan initiative to implement medication prescribing algorithms for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. The algorithms were incorporated into the electronic medical records system of a four-county community mental health system. Guideline adherence of 30 providers who treated nearly 3,000 patients was measured at mid- and endpoints of the first year. They were adherent for about a third of their patients in the first six months (32%) and more than half in the second (52%). Scores on scales measuring providers' perceptions of algorithm ease of use and usefulness were in the midrange at both time points.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and characterized by a poor prognosis. It has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their partners. Recently, it has been shown that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer patients. The generalization of these results is limited since most participants were female patients with breast cancer. Moreover, only one study examined the effectiveness of MBSR in partners of cancer patients. Therefore, in the present trial we study the effectiveness of MBSR versus treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with lung cancer and their partners.Methods/design: A parallel group, randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare MBSR with TAU. Lung cancer patients who have received or are still under treatment, and their partners are recruited. Assessments will take place at baseline, post intervention and at three-month follow-up. The primary outcome is psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (only for patients), caregiver appraisal (only for partners), relationship quality and spirituality. In addition, cost-effectiveness ratio (only in patients) and several process variables are assessed.Discussion: This trial will provide information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in patients with lung cancer and their partners.</ab>

        <ab>Background: There is controversy about whether psychotherapies are effective in the treatment of subclinical depression, defined by clinically relevant depressive symptoms in the absence of a major depressive disorder.Aims: To examine whether psychotherapies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms, reduce the risk of developing major depressive disorder and have comparable effects to psychological treatment of major depression.Method: We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 studies comparing a psychological treatment of subclinical depression with a control group.Results: The target groups, therapies and characteristics of the included studies differed considerably from each other, and the quality of many studies was not optimal. Psychotherapies did have a small to moderate effect on depressive symptoms against care as usual at the post-test assessment (g = 0.35, 95% CI 0.23-0.47; NNT = 5, 95% CI 4-8) and significantly reduced the incidence of major depressive episodes at 6 months (RR = 0.61) and possibly at 12 months (RR = 0.74). The effects were significantly smaller than those of psychotherapy for major depressive disorder and could be accounted for by non-specific effects of treatment.Conclusions: Psychotherapy may be effective in the treatment of subclinical depression and reduce the incidence of major depression, but more high-quality research is needed.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depressive disorders are highly prevalent, have a detrimental impact on the quality of life of patients and their relatives and are associated with increased mortality rates, high levels of service use and substantial economic costs. Current treatments are estimated to only reduce about one-third of the disease burden of depressive disorders. Prevention may be an alternative strategy to further reduce the disease burden of depression.Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of preventive interventions in participants with no diagnosed depression at baseline on the incidence of diagnosed depressive disorders at follow-up. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria.Results: We found that the relative risk of developing a depressive disorder was incidence rate ratio = 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.91), indicating a 21% decrease in incidence in prevention groups in comparison with control groups. Heterogeneity was low (I(2) = 24%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one new case of depressive disorder was 20. Sensitivity analyses revealed no differences between type of prevention (e.g. selective, indicated or universal) nor between type of intervention (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy or other). However, data on NNT did show differences.Conclusions: Prevention of depression seems feasible and may, in addition to treatment, be an effective way to delay or prevent the onset of depressive disorders. Preventing or delaying these disorders may contribute to the further reduction of the disease burden and the economic costs associated with depressive disorders.</ab>

        <ab>For this study, 200 women and men with a major mood disorder or schizophrenia were interviewed about their sexual and reproductive behaviors. The responses of the women and men were compared with those of persons from a national health survey who were matched for age and race. Compared with women from the national survey, women with mental illness had fewer pregnancies and live births but were more likely to have had a pregnancy that did not result in a live birth. Women with mental illness had more lifetime sexual partners. The findings suggest that clinicians should pay attention to patients' sexual and reproductive health.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The study explored population-based service planning for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Evidence suggests the usefulness of MBCT in relapse prevention for individuals reporting three or more major depressive episodes.Methods: Depression data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey. A simulation model estimated recurrence rates and population sizes to sustain MBCT therapists (each conducting two ten-person groups per year).Results: Approximately 4.2% of the population are candidates for MBCT, and about 13 candidates would arise annually per 10,000 population. If MBCT was acceptable to 20%, for example, a population of 200,000 could support two therapists.Conclusions: A large proportion of the population is eligible for MBCT introduction; however, after introduction, the rate of emergence of candidates would yield a smaller patient pool, which may limit implementation in small population centers. Treatment acceptability is a key variable. These analyses highlight the potential value of epidemiologic data and simulation modeling in planning.</ab>

        <ab>Background: High levels of emotional distress in cancer patients often goes unnoticed in daily clinical routine, resulting in severe undertreatment of mental health problems in this patient group. Screening tools can be used to increase case identification, however, screening alone does not necessarily translate into better mental health for the patient. Doctors play a key role in providing basic emotional support and transferring the patients in need of such specific support to mental health professionals. This study investigates whether a stepped care model, combining screening, doctor consultation and professional psycho-oncological service in a structured way, improves the emotional wellbeing of cancer patients.Methods/design: This study is a cluster randomized trial with two parallel groups (intervention vs. care as usual), set in an academic hospital. Participants are cancer patients, a total of 1,000 at baseline. The intervention consists of stepped psychosocial care. Step one: screening for distress, step two: feedback of screening results to the doctor in charge of the patient and consultation with the patient, and step three: based on a shared patient-doctor decision, either transferal to the consultation liaison (CL) service or not. The outcome will be emotional well-being half a year after baseline, ascertained with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Randomization will be done by the cluster randomization of wards.Discussion: Mental health problems not only cause emotional suffering but also direct and indirect costs. This calls for timely and adequate psychosocial support, especially as we know that such support is effective. However, not every cancer patient can and must be treated by a mental health professional. Allocating limited resources most sensibly and economically is of crucial importance for our healthcare system to ensure the best quality of care to as many patients as possible. It is the hope of the STEPPED CARE trial that this model is both effective and efficient, and that it can be implemented in other hospitals as well, if proven to be effective.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Register (Clinicaltrials.gov) identifier: NCT01859429 registration date 17 May 2013.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Comorbid mental health problems have been shown to have an adverse effect on the quality of life of people with common eye disorders. This study aims to assess whether symptoms of anxiety and/or depression are more prevalent in people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) than in people without this condition.Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO) from inception to February 2012 was conducted to identify studies of AMD populations which measured symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Reference checking of relevant articles was also performed. Data on the study setting, prevalence and how anxiety and depression were measured were extracted from the papers. Critical appraisal was performed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools.Results: A total of 16 papers were included in the review, from an original search result of 597. The prevalence estimates, taken from nine cross-sectional and cohort studies, ranged from 15.7%-44% for depressive symptoms and 9.6%-30.1% for anxiety symptoms in people with AMD. The seven case-control studies found that people with AMD were more likely to experience symptoms of depression compared with those without AMD, but not more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety.Conclusions: Overall, the evidence suggests that symptoms of depression are more prevalent amongst AMD populations than anxiety symptoms. The heterogeneity of the studies included in this review means that it is difficult to draw strong conclusions as to the true estimates of depression and anxiety symptoms in AMD populations and prevented formal meta-analysis. Further research which specifies clinical anxiety and gives clear definitions as to the type of AMD being investigated is required.</ab>

        <ab>Although more than half of adults who have a serious and persistent mental illness live with their families (1), less than 10 percent of families of outpatients with schizophrenia receive support or education (2). Such services fail to be provided despite the fact that family participation in well-designed psychoeducational programs has been documented as reducing relapse and readmission rates, improving involvement and adherence to treatment (3,4), and producing positive outcomes for caregivers, including improved morale, better knowledge of mental illness, enhanced feelings of empowerment, and reduced worry and displeasure about their loved ones (5,6). Moreover, the vast majority of mental health providers believe that educating families about mental illness and its treatment is very important (7). Why, then, do so few clinicians commit the requisite time and energy to providing these effective and much appreciated services? There are four sources of obstacles to the adoption of a psychosocial treatment innovation such as family psychoeducation. The obstacles stem from the psychoeducational program itself (for example, its unfamiliarity and conflicts with the existing treatment ideology); the clinicians (lack of training, experience, and competence in functioning as "teachers" with families); the host agency or institution (countervailing priorities and lack of administrative support); and the process of dissemination (lack of knowledgeable consultants or enthusiastic "champions" or advocates for family psychoeducation and lack of user-friendly curricula or program manuals). These obstacles can be overcome when practitioners and family members work together as stakeholders in the benefits that accrue from ongoing psychoeducation (8). In this month's column, Michelle Sherman, Ph.D., presents the family psychoeducation program she created at the Oklahoma City Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Dr. Sherman describes how she tailored the intervention to the VA population, thus generating the support not only of the clients and their families but also of her fellow clinicians and the VA administration. Her work demonstrates that when mental health clinicians devote time, energy, and expertise to supporting and educating caregivers, significant benefits emerge for both clients and their families.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Bangladesh has the highest natural disaster mortality rate in the world, with over half a million people lost to disaster events since 1970. Most of these people have died during floods or cyclones, both of which are likely to become more frequent due to global climate change. To date, the government's post-disaster response strategy has focused, increasingly effectively, on the physical needs of survivors, through the provision of shelter, food and medical care. However, the serious and widespread mental health consequences of natural disasters in Bangladesh have not yet received the attention that they deserve. This Debate article proposes a practical model that will facilitate the provision of comprehensive and effective post-disaster mental health services for vulnerable Bangladeshis on a sustainable basis.Discussion: A series of socially determined factors render the women and the poor of Bangladesh particularly vulnerable to dying in natural disasters; and, for those who survive, to suffering from some sort of disaster-related mental health illness. For women, this is largely due to the enforced gender separation, or purdah, that they endure; while for the poor, it is the fact that they are, by definition, only able to afford to live in the most climatically dangerous, and under-served parts of the country. Although the disasters themselves are brought by nature, therefore, social determinants increase the vulnerability of particular groups to mental illness as a result of them. While deeply entrenched, these determinants are at least partially amenable to change through policy and action.Summary: In response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the World Health Organisation developed a framework for providing mental health and psychosocial support after major disasters, which, we argue, could be adapted to Bangladeshi post-cyclone and post-flood contexts. The framework is community-based, it includes both medical and non-clinical components, and it could be adapted so that women and the poor are actively sought out and provided for. After training, these services could be run by Bangladesh's pre-existing 50,000-strong Cyclone Preparedness Programme workforce, alongside the country's extensive network of community-based health workers.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Among the 50 million people with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide ∼15 to 60% likely also suffer from depression and/or anxiety and 80% reside in low-income regions where human and technological resources for care are extremely limited.Methods: In Zambia, we carried out a retrospective chart review of 200 randomly selected files of PWE using a structured abstraction form to systematically collect socio-demographic data and clinical details on the detection and treatment of depression and/or anxiety.Results: Only 2 PWE (1%) had depression diagnosed and none were given a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Complaints suggestive of underlying depressive and/or anxiety disorders were documented in 120 (60%), but no diagnoses were made and no referrals, investigations or treatment were offered.Conclusions: Further research is required to establish the prevalence of depression and anxiety among PWE in sub-Saharan Africa and efforts are needed to improve screening and treatment for common, treatable psychiatric comorbidities in PWE in resource limited settings.</ab>

        <ab>Background: NICE guidance states that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) should be offered to all patients with psychosis. However, there is a need to improve access to therapeutic interventions. We aim to train frontline mental health staff to deliver brief, structured CBT-based therapies. We have developed and piloted a manualized intervention to support people with psychosis and anxious avoidance or depression to work towards a personal recovery goal.Methods/design: The 'GOALS Study' is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing usual care plus an 8-week intervention with usual care alone. The key objective is to assess clinical feasibility (recruitment and randomization; compliance with the treatment manual; acceptability and satisfaction; progress towards goals). A secondary objective is a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Sixty-six participants with a diagnosis of psychosis, plus symptoms of depression or anxiety will be recruited from adult mental health services. Those currently refusing medication, in receipt of CBT, or with a primary diagnosis of an organic mental health problem or substance dependency will be excluded. Following informed consent, randomization will be independent of the trial team, at a 50:50 ratio, at the level of the individual and stratified by main problem focus. Following randomization, participants allocated to the intervention group will begin the 8-week intervention with a local, trained member of staff, supervised by the study coordinator. Outcomes will be assessed blind to treatment condition at 0, 12 and 18 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome measure for the efficacy analysis will be activity levels at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include mood, psychotic symptoms, quality of life and clinical distress. A health economic analysis comparing service use in each condition will also be performed. Recruitment began in March, 2013 and is ongoing until December, 2014.Discussion: This is the first trial of the GOALS intervention. The approach is brief and staff can be readily trained in its delivery: there is therefore potential to develop a cost-effective intervention that could be widely disseminated. If the trial proves clinically feasible and demonstrates preliminary evidence of efficacy, a large multi-site trial will be warranted.Trial Registration: Current Controlled TrialsIsrctn: 73188383. http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=13538.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention to reduce mental health problems and bolster resilience among children living in households affected by caregiver HIV in Rwanda.Design: Pre-post design, including 6-month follow-up.Methods: The Family Strengthening Intervention (FSI) aims to reduce mental health problems among HIV-affected children through improved child-caregiver relationships, family communication and parenting skills, HIV psychoeducation and connections to resources. Twenty families (N = 39 children) with at least one HIV-positive caregiver and one child 7-17 years old were enrolled in the FSI. Children and caregivers were administered locally adapted and validated measures of child mental health problems, as well as measures of protective processes and parenting. Assessments were administered at pre and postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. Multilevel models accounting for clustering by family tested changes in outcomes of interest. Qualitative interviews were completed to understand acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction with the FSI.Results: Families reported high satisfaction with the FSI. Caregiver-reported improvements in family connectedness, good parenting, social support and children's pro-social behaviour (P &lt; 0.05) were sustained and strengthened from postintervention to 6-month follow-up. Additional improvements in caregiver-reported child perseverance/self-esteem, depression, anxiety and irritability were seen at follow-up (P &lt; .05). Significant decreases in child-reported harsh punishment were observed at postintervention and follow-up, and decreases in caregiver reported harsh punishment were also recorded on follow-up (P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion: The FSI is a feasible and acceptable intervention that shows promise for improving mental health symptoms and strengthening protective factors among children and families affected by HIV in low-resource settings.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) is a standardized psychosocial intervention that is designed to help people with severe mental illness manage their illness and achieve personal recovery goals. This literature review summarizes the research on consumer-level effects of IMR and articles describing its implementation.Methods: In 2011, the authors conducted a literature search of Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library by using the key words "illness management and recovery," "wellness management and recovery," or "IMR" AND ("schizophrenia" OR "bipolar" OR "depression" OR "recovery" OR "mental health"). Publications that cited two seminal IMR articles also guided further exploration of sources. Articles that did not deal explicitly with IMR or a direct adaptation were excluded.Results: Three randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), three quasi-controlled trials, and three pre-post trials have been conducted. The RCTs found that consumers receiving IMR reported significantly more improved scores on the IMR Scale (IMRS) than consumers who received treatment as usual. IMRS ratings by clinicians and ratings of psychiatric symptoms by independent observers were also more improved for the IMR consumers. Implementation studies (N=16) identified several important barriers to and facilitators of IMR, including supervision and agency support. Implementation outcomes, such as participation rates and fidelity, varied widely.Conclusions: IMR shows promise for improving some consumer-level outcomes. Important issues regarding implementation require additional study. Future research is needed to compare outcomes of IMR consumers and active control groups and to provide a more detailed understanding of how other services utilized by consumers may affect outcomes of IMR.</ab>

        <ab>We analyzed data from a randomized trial of 322 actively depressed smokers and examined the effect of smoking cessation on their mental health functioning. Only 1 of 10 measures at 4 follow-up time points was significant: participants who successfully stopped smoking reported less alcohol use than did participants who continued smoking. Depressive symptoms declined significantly over time for participants who stopped smoking and those who continued smoking; there were no group differences. Individuals in treatment for clinical depression can be helped to stop smoking without adversely affecting their mental health functioning.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Clinicians request guidance to aid the routine use and interpretation of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), but tools are lacking. We aimed to develop a Clinical Decision Support Tool (CDST) focused on information needs, family anxiety, depression, and breathlessness (measured using the Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS)) and related PROM implementation guidance.Methods: We drafted recommendations based on findings from systematic literature searches. In a modified online Delphi study, 38 experts from 12 countries with different professional backgrounds, including four patient/carer representatives, were invited to rate the appropriateness of these recommendations for problems of varying severity in the CDST. The quality of evidence was added for each recommendation, and the final draft CDST reappraised by the experts. The accompanying implementation guidance was built on data from literature scoping with expert revision (n = 11 invited experts).Results: The systematic literature searches identified over 560 potential references, of which 43 met the inclusion criteria. Two Delphi rounds (response rate 66% and 62%; n = 25 and 23) found that good patient care, psychosocial support and empathy, and open communication were central to supporting patients and families affected by all POS concerns as a core requirement. Assessment was recommended for increasing problems (i.e. scores), followed by non-pharmacological interventions and for breathlessness and depression, pharmacological interventions. Accompanying PROM implementation guidance was built based on the 8-step International Society for Quality of Life Research framework, as revised by nine (response rate 82%) experts.Conclusions: This CDST provides a straightforward guide to help support clinical care and improve evidence-based outcomes for patients with progressive illness and their families, addressing four areas of clinical uncertainty. Recommendations should be used flexibly, alongside skilled individual clinical assessment and knowledge, taking into account patients' and families' individual preferences, circumstances, and resources. The CDST is provided with accompanying implementation guidance to facilitate PROM use and is ready for further development and evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Increased life expectancy has resulted in a greater provision of informal care within the community for patients with chronic physical health conditions. Informal carers are at greater risk of poor mental health, with one in three informal carers of stroke survivors experiencing depression. However, currently no psychological treatments tailored to the unique needs of depressed informal carers of stroke survivors exist. Furthermore, informal carers of stroke survivors experience a number of barriers to attending traditional face-to-face psychological services, such as lack of time and the demands of the caring role. The increased flexibility associated with supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help (CBTsh), such as the ability for support to be provided by telephone, email, or face-to-face, alongside shorter support sessions, may help overcome such barriers to access. CBTsh, tailored to depressed informal carers of stroke survivors may represent an effective and acceptable solution.Methods/design: This study is a Phase II (feasibility) randomized controlled trial (RCT) following guidance in the MRC Complex Interventions Research Methods Framework. We will randomize a sample of depressed informal carers of stroke survivors to receive CBT self-help supported by mental health paraprofessionals, or treatment-as-usual. Consistent with the objectives of assessing the feasibility of trial design and procedures for a potential larger scale trial we will measure the following outcomes: a) feasibility of patient recruitment (recruitment and refusal rates); (b) feasibility and acceptability of data collection procedures; (c) levels of attrition; (d) likely intervention effect size; (e) variability in number, length and frequency of support sessions estimated to bring about recovery; and (f) acceptability of the intervention. Additionally, we will collect data on the diagnosis of depression, symptoms of depression and anxiety, functional impairment, carer burden, quality of life, and stroke survivor mobility skill, self-care and functional ability, measured at four and six months post-randomization.Discussion: This study will provide important information for the feasibility and design of a Phase III (effectiveness) trial in the future. If the intervention is identified to be feasible, effective, and acceptable, a written CBTsh intervention for informal carers of stroke survivors, supported by mental health paraprofessionals, could represent a cost-effective model of care.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN63590486.</ab>

        <ab>As part of a larger interview, clients of assertive community treatment programs answered an open-ended question about what they liked least about assertive community treatment. Of 182 clients, 44 percent reported that they disliked nothing; 21 percent said that they disliked features that are considered specific to assertive community treatment, such as home visits, or that have been criticized in the literature, such as intrusiveness; 16 percent said that they were dissatisfied with underimplementation of elements thought to characterize assertive community treatment, such as frequency of visits; and 19 percent said that they were dissatisfied with general aspects of mental health service delivery, such as an inconvenient office location. Compared with clients of programs with low levels of fidelity to assertive community treatment, clients of high-fidelity programs had fewer complaints overall and fewer complaints about features considered to be specific to assertive community treatment.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of maintenance treatment for late-life depression on social adjustment. The authors hypothesized that elderly patients recovering from depression would have better social adjustment with medication and interpersonal psychotherapy than with medication or psychotherapy alone. METHOD: Patients aged 60 and older recovering from recurrent major depression were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: nortriptyline and interpersonal psychotherapy, nortriptyline and clinic visits, placebo and psychotherapy, or placebo and clinic visits. The Social Adjustment Scale was administered every 3 months until illness recurrence. Combined treatment was compared to monotherapy on scores over 1 year among patients who remained in recovery (N=49). RESULTS: Patients receiving nortriptyline and interpersonal psychotherapy maintained social adjustment, which declined in those receiving monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of late-life depression with nortriptyline and psychotherapy is more likely to maintain social adjustment than treatment with either alone. Combination therapy improves not only duration but quality of wellness.</ab>

        <ab>Longitudinal data from 4,331 homeless mentally ill clients at 18 sites participating in the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports program were used to assess participants' quality of life over a one-year period. At baseline higher quality of life was associated with less severe depressive and psychotic symptoms, less use of alcohol and drugs, and more social support. At 12 months improved quality of life was associated with decreased psychotic and depressive symptoms, reduced substance abuse, fewer days of homelessness, and increased social support, income, employment, and service use.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study was to describe the rehabilitation goals of 165 consumers with serious mental illness who were living in the community and to assess the level of concordance between the consumers' perceived importance of their goals and the services they received to help them meet those goals. A structured interview was used to facilitate the expression of rehabilitation goals by consumers in the psychiatric rehabilitation program of a hospital in Montreal, Canada. The most frequently mentioned rehabilitation goals pertained to improving consumers' financial situation, physical health, cognitive capacities, and symptoms. Among these goals, the level of concordance was highest for services addressing symptoms and lowest for religious or spiritual goals.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Melatonin (MLT) is a pleiotropic neurohormone controlling many physiological processes and whose dysfunction may contribute to several different diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, circadian and mood disorders, insomnia, type 2 diabetes and pain. Melatonin is synthesized by the pineal gland during the night and acts through 2 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), MT1 (MEL1a) and MT2 (MEL1b). Although a bulk of research has examined the physiopathological effects of MLT, few studies have investigated the selective role played by MT1 and MT2 receptors. Here we have reviewed current knowledge about the implications of MT2 receptors in brain functions. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and articles reference lists for studies on MT2 receptor ligands in sleep, anxiety, neuropsychiatric diseases and psychopharmacology, including genetic studies on the MTNR1B gene, which encodes the melatonin MT2 receptor. Results: These studies demonstrate that MT2 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer disease and pain and that selective MT2 receptor agonists show hypnotic and anxiolytic properties. Limitations: Studies examining the role of MT2 receptors in psychopharmacology are still limited. Conclusion: The development of novel selective MT2 receptor ligands, together with further preclinical in vivo studies, may clarify the role of this receptor in brain function and psychopharmacology. The superfamily of GPCRs has proven to be among the most successful drug targets and, consequently, MT2 receptors have great potential for pioneer drug discovery in the treatment of mental diseases for which limited therapeutic targets are currently available.</ab>

        <ab>People with mood disorders experience cognitive impairments that are predictive of functional disability. Cognitive remediation (CR) is an empirically validated intervention that is designed to remediate neurocognitive deficits and improve functioning. Although much of the focus of this treatment during the last decade has centred on attention deficit disorders, brain injury, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, emerging evidence suggests that CR is an effective intervention for mood disorders and that these treatment effects translate into improvements in cognitive performance and possibly functioning. Our review aims to examine the profile and magnitude of cognitive impairments in mood disorders, review the evidence in support of CR for this population, and discuss future research directions in CR.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Domestic violence and abuse (DVA), defined as threatening behavior or abuse by adults who are intimate partners or family members, is a key public health and clinical priority. The prevalence of DVA in the United Kingdom and worldwide is high, and its impact on physical and mental health is detrimental and persistent. There is currently little support within healthcare settings for women experiencing DVA. Psychological problems in particular may be difficult to manage outside specialist services, as conventional forms of therapy such as counseling that do not address the violence may be ineffective or even harmful. The aim of this study is to assess the overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel psychological intervention tailored specifically for survivors of DVA and delivered by domestic violence advocates based in third-sector organizations.Methods and Study Design: This study is an open, pragmatic, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial. Women ages 16 years and older experiencing domestic violence are being enrolled and randomly allocated to receive usual DVA agency advocacy support (control) or usual DVA agency support plus psychological intervention (intervention). Those in the intervention group will receive eight specialist psychological advocacy (SPA) sessions weekly or fortnightly, with two follow-up sessions, 1 month and then 3 months later. This will be in addition to any advocacy support sessions each woman receives. Women in the control group will receive usual DVA agency support but no additional SPA sessions. The aim is to recruit 250 women to reach the target sample size. The primary outcomes are psychological well-being and depression severity at 1 yr from baseline, as measured by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Secondary outcome measures include anxiety, posttraumatic stress, severity and frequency of abuse, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Data from a subsample of women in both groups will contribute to a nested qualitative study with repeat interviews during the year of follow-up.Discussion: This study will contribute to the evidence base for management of the psychological needs of women experiencing DVA. The findings will have important implications for healthcare commissioners and providers, as well as third sector specialist DVA agencies providing services to this client group.Trial Registration: ISRCTN58561170.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The activities of mental health practitioners are poorly understood and described because of a lack of generally accepted and understandable categories. Greater precision is needed for accountability, planning, and evaluation. The objective of this study was to identify a valid and reliable set of categories to describe the clinical work practices of intensive case managers in the United Kingdom. Methods: Eight intensive case managers participated in a Delphi process to produce a set of categories that described their clinical work practices. They each completed three questionnaires and participated in a final group discussion. Results: The initial open questionnaire generated 38 potential categories after exact duplicates were removed. In round 2, the intensive case managers each rated the 38 categories from 1 to 5 (essential to unimportant). A high degree of consensus on the relative importance of the 38 suggested practice categories was rapidly achieved. In round 3, they re-rated the categories in the light of group medians and their own round 2 ratings. In a structured face-to-face discussion group, the intensive case managers then reduced the 38 potential categories to ten comprehensive and mutually exclusive categories that were judged to adequately and accurately reflect work practices. They were housing, finance, daily living skills, criminal justice system, occupation and leisure, engagement, physical health, caregivers and significant others, specific mental health intervention or assessment, and medication. Conclusions: Delphi methods were effective and relatively straightforward in producing an agreed-on set of categories with which to record clinical activity and inform care planning.</ab>

        <ab>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) incorporates elements of cognitive-behavioural therapy with mindfulness-based stress reduction into an 8-session group program. Initially conceived as an intervention for relapse prevention in people with recurrent depression, it has since been applied to various psychiatric conditions. Our paper aims to briefly describe MBCT and its putative mechanisms of action, and to review the current findings about the use of MBCT in people with mood and anxiety disorders. The therapeutic stance of MBCT focuses on encouraging patients to adopt a new way of being and relating to their thoughts and feelings, while placing little emphasis on altering or challenging specific cognitions. Preliminary functional neuroimaging studies are consistent with an account of mindfulness improving emotional regulation by enhancing cortical regulation of limbic circuits and attentional control. Research findings from several randomized controlled trials suggest that MBCT is a useful intervention for relapse prevention in patients with recurrent depression, with efficacy that may be similar to maintenance antidepressants. Preliminary studies indicate MBCT also shows promise in the treatment of active depression, including treatment-resistant depression. Pilot studies have also evaluated MBCT in bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. Patient and clinician resources for further information on mindfulness and MBCT are provided.</ab>

        <ab>Use of drugs and alcohol by 43 predominantly male outpatients who had severe mental illness and a comorbid substance use disorder were assessed weekly through the ratings of experienced dual disorder case managers and through blinded research urine toxicology tests. The percentage of weeks in which drugs or alcohol were used was calculated on the basis of one or both assessments. The case managers often missed drug use over the weekends, which was detected by the urine toxicology tests. Agreement between the two methods varied widely, even when the ratings were made by highly experienced case managers. These findings have implications for monitoring patients with dual diagnoses and provide insight into the accuracy of case manager ratings.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Easy access to the internet has spawned a wealth of research to investigate the effects of its use on depression. However, one limitation of many previous studies is that they disregard the interactive mechanisms of risk and protective factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate a resilience model in the relationship between worry, daily internet video game playing, daily sleep duration, mentors, social networks and depression, using a moderated mediation analysis.Methods: 6068 Korean undergraduate and graduate students participated in this study. The participants completed a web-based mental health screening questionnaire including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and information about number of worries, number of mentors, number of campus social networks, daily sleep duration, daily amount of internet video game playing and daily amount of internet searching on computer or smartphone. A moderated mediation analysis was carried out using the PROCESS macro which allowed the inclusion of mediators and moderator in the same model.Results: The results showed that the daily amount of internet video game playing and daily sleep duration partially mediated the association between the number of worries and the severity of depression. In addition, the mediating effect of the daily amount of internet video game playing was moderated by both the number of mentors and the number of campus social networks.Conclusions: The current findings indicate that the negative impact of worry on depression through internet video game playing can be buffered when students seek to have a number of mentors and campus social networks. Interventions should therefore target individuals who have higher number of worries but seek only a few mentors or campus social networks. Social support via campus mentorship and social networks ameliorate the severity of depression in university students.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are increasingly recognized as a health care policy priority. Reducing the treatment gap for common mental disorders requires strengthening the quality of primary mental health care. We developed a knowledge application program designed to improve the organization and delivery of care for anxiety and depression in community-based primary mental health care teams in Quebec, Canada. The principal objectives of the study are: to implement and evaluate this evidence-based knowledge application program; to examine the contextual factors associated with the selection of local quality improvement strategies; to explore barriers and facilitators associated with the implementation of local quality improvement plans; and to study the implementation of local quality monitoring strategies.Methods: The research design is a mixed-methods prospective multiple case study. The main analysis unit (cases) is composed of the six multidisciplinary community-based primary mental health care teams, and each of the cases has identified at least one primary care medical clinic interested in collaborating with the implementation project. The training modules of the program are based on the Chronic Care Model, and the implementation strategies were developed according to the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services conceptual framework.Discussion: The implementation of an evidence-based knowledge application program for anxiety and depression in primary care aims to improve the organization and delivery of mental health services. The uptake of evidence to improve the quality of care for common mental disorders in primary care is a complex process that requires careful consideration of the context in which innovations are introduced. The project will provide a close examination of the interplay between evidence, context and facilitation, and contribute to the understanding of factors associated with the process of implementation of interventions in routine care. The implementation of the knowledge application program with a population health perspective is consistent with the priorities set forth in the current mental health care reform in Quebec. Strengthening primary mental health care will lead to a more efficient health care system.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Frail older people with mental health problems including delirium, dementia and depression are often admitted to general hospitals. However, hospital admission may cause distress, and can be associated with complications. Some commentators suggest that their healthcare needs could be better met elsewhere.Methods: We studied consecutive patients aged 70 or older admitted for emergency medical or trauma care to an 1800 bed general hospital which provided sole emergency medical and trauma services for its local population. Patients were screened for mental health problems, and those screening positive were invited to take part. 250 participants were recruited and a sub-sample of 53 patients was assessed by a geriatrician for diagnoses, impairments and disabilities, healthcare interventions and outstanding needs.Results: Median age was 86 years, median Mini-Mental State Examination score at admission was 16/30, and 45% had delirium. 19% lived in a care home prior to admission. All the patients were complex. A wide range of main admission diagnoses was recorded, and these were usually complicated by falls, immobility, pain, delirium, dehydration or incontinence. There was a median of six active diagnoses, and eight active problems. One quarter of problems was unexplained. A median of 13 interventions was recorded, and a median of a further four interventions suggested by the geriatrician. Those with more severe cognitive impairment had no less medical need.Conclusions: This patient group, admitted to hospital in the United Kingdom, had numerous healthcare problems, and by implication, extensive healthcare needs. Patients with simpler conditions were not identified, but may have already been rapidly discharged or redirected to non-hospital services by the time assessments were made. To meet the needs of this group outside the hospital would need considerable investment in medical, nursing, therapy and diagnostic facilities. In the meantime, acute hospitals should adapt to deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment, and provide for their mental health needs.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Traditional diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD) suggested that the presence or absence of stress prior to onset results in either 'reactive' or 'endogenous' subtypes of the disorder, respectively. Several lines of research suggest that the biological underpinnings of 'reactive' or 'endogenous' subtypes may also differ, resulting in differential response to treatment. We investigated this hypothesis by comparing the gene-expression profiles of three animal models of 'reactive' and 'endogenous' depression. We then translated these findings to clinical samples using a human post-mortem mRNA study.Methods: Affymetrix mouse whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays were used to measure gene expression from hippocampal tissues of 144 mice from the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) project. The study used four inbred mouse strains and two depressogenic 'stress' protocols (maternal separation and Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress) to model 'reactive' depression. Stress-related mRNA differences in mouse were compared with a parallel mRNA study using Flinders Sensitive and Resistant rat lines as a model of 'endogenous' depression. Convergent genes differentially expressed across the animal studies were used to inform candidate gene selection in a human mRNA post-mortem case control study from the Stanley Brain Consortium.Results: In the mouse 'reactive' model, the expression of 350 genes changed in response to early stresses and 370 in response to late stresses. A minimal genetic overlap (less than 8.8%) was detected in response to both stress protocols, but 30% of these genes (21) were also differentially regulated in the 'endogenous' rat study. This overlap is significantly greater than expected by chance. The VAMP-2 gene, differentially expressed across the rodent studies, was also significantly altered in the human study after correcting for multiple testing.Conclusions: Our results suggest that 'endogenous' and 'reactive' subtypes of depression are associated with largely distinct changes in gene-expression. However, they also suggest that the molecular signature of 'reactive' depression caused by early stressors differs considerably from that of 'reactive' depression caused by late stressors. A small set of genes was consistently dysregulated across each paradigm and in post-mortem brain tissue of depressed patients suggesting a final common pathway to the disorder. These genes included the VAMP-2 gene, which has previously been associated with Axis-I disorders including MDD, bipolar depression, schizophrenia and with antidepressant treatment response. We also discuss the implications of our findings for disease classification, personalized medicine and case-control studies of MDD.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is a common and distressing mental health problem that is responsible for significant individual disability and cost to society. Medication and psychological therapies are effective for treating depression and maintenance anti-depressants (m-ADM) can prevent relapse. However, individuals with depression often express a wish for psychological help that can help them recover from depression in the long-term. A recently developed treatment, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), shows potential as a brief group program for people with recurring depression.This trial asks the policy research question; is MBCT with support to taper/discontinue antidepressant medication (MBCT-TS) superior to m-ADM in terms of: a primary outcome of preventing depressive relapse/recurrence over 24 months; and secondary outcomes of (a) depression free days, (b) residual depressive symptoms, (c) antidepressant medication (ADM) usage, (d) psychiatric and medical co-morbidity, (e) quality of life, and (f) cost effectiveness? An explanatory research question also asks whether an increase in mindfulness skills is the key mechanism of change.The design is a single-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial examining MBCT-TS versus m-ADM with an embedded process study. To answer the main policy research question the proposed trial compares MBCT-TS with m-ADM for patients with recurrent depression. Four hundred and twenty patients with recurrent major depressive disorder in full or partial remission will be recruited through primary care.Results: Depressive relapse/recurrence over two years is the primary outcome variable. Analyses will be conducted following CONSORT standards and overseen by the trial's Data Monitoring and Safety Committee. Initial analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with subsequent analyses being per protocol. The explanatory question will be addressed in two mutually informative ways: quantitative measurement of potential mediating variables pre- and post-treatment and a qualitative study of service users' views and experiences.Conclusions: If the results of our exploratory trial are extended to this definitive trial, MBCT-TS will be established as an alternative approach to maintenance antidepressants for people with a history of recurrent depression. The process studies will provide evidence about the effective components which can be used to improve MBCT and inform theory as well as other therapeutic approaches.Trial Registration: Trial registered 7 May 2009; ISRCTN26666654.</ab>

        <ab>Motivational interviewing (MI) was originally developed for the treatment of substance abuse but is rapidly expanding to other major mental health populations beyond addictions. This brief review considers the use of MI and related motivational enhancement therapies (METs) in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, and concurrent psychosis and substance use disorders. MI-MET has been added and (or) integrated into treatment for these problems in a wide variety of ways, most commonly as a pretreatment to other therapies (psychosocial treatments and pharmacotherapy) or integrated into standard assessment procedures. In each problem domain, the bulk of the current evidence supports the value of adding MI to existing therapies in increasing engagement with treatment and in improving clinical outcomes. This is particularly encouraging in that many of the populations included in these investigations represent severe and treatment-recalcitrant populations. However, research on the application of MI to other major mental health problems beyond addictions is in the early stages, with existing studies having numerous limitations (for example, small uncontrolled studies or lack of adequate control groups, and failure to establish both MI treatment integrity and the unique contribution of MI in integrated treatments). In short, the substantial body of promising preliminary findings strongly support the continued investigation of MI and related methods for these populations in well-designed clinical trials that examine not only the additive value of MI but also mechanisms underlying these effects and individual differences (moderators) indicating the need for MI.</ab>

        <ab>In the commentary below, Robert Cancro, M.D., discusses the article on page 327, reprinted from the February 1956 issue of Mental Hospitals, describing how hospitals were dealing with clinical and administrative issues surrounding the use of neuroleptic drugs. Although Dr. Cancro considers the introduction of neuroleptics one of the great psychiatric revolutions of the 20th century, he believes that the changes in patient care and treatment following their introduction have not always been positive.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Post-Stroke Depression with or without Anxiety (PSDA) is a common disorder in the chronic phase of stroke. Neuropsychiatric problems, such as PSDA, have a negative impact on social reintegration and quality of life. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment available for reducing PSDA symptoms. In the recent literature on depression in the general population it has been shown that depression complaints can diminish by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In the current study, the effectiveness of augmented, activation-based and individually tailored CBT on the reduction of depression and anxiety will be investigated in patients with PSDA. Additionally, the effects on various secondary outcome measures, such as quality of life, goal attainment and societal participation will be evaluated. This study is embedded in a consortium of 4 interrelated studies on quality of life after stroke (Restore4Stroke). Methods/design: A multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial is conducted. A sample of 106 PSDA patients, as assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS depression subscale &gt;7), will be recruited and randomly allocated to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental intervention consists of an augmented CBT intervention. The intervention is based on CBT principles of recognizing, registering, and altering negative thoughts and cognitions so that mood, and emotional symptoms are improved. CBT is augmented with direct in-vivo activation offered by occupational or movement therapists. Patients in the control group will receive a computerized cognitive training intervention. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention, and at 6 and 12 months follow up. Discussion: This study is the first randomized clinical trial that evaluates the (maintenance of) effects of augmented CBT on post-stroke depression with or without anxiety symptoms. Together with three other projects, the Restore4Stroke PSDA trial will provide novel information about the (treatment of) emotional problems and quality of life after stroke.

        <ab>Background: The prevalence of mental illness in young people is the highest of any age group, with the onset of depression, anxiety and substance use peaking between 18 and 24 years. Effective treatments that target sub-threshold or mild to moderate levels of disorder in young people are required to reduce the risk of persistence and recurrence. The aims of this study are to evaluate whether treatments that are less intensive than cognitive-behaviour therapy, such as problem solving therapy and exercise treatments, are acceptable and effective in managing depression and anxiety symptoms in young people and to identify possible attributes in those who are likely to respond to these treatments.Methods/design: This is a factorial randomised controlled trial conducted at a large, metropolitan youth mental health service. Participants are young help-seekers aged 15-25 years with sub-threshold or mild to moderate levels of depression and anxiety (with or without comorbid substance use). The interventions comprise 4 treatment combinations delivered by psychologists over 6 sessions on a weekly basis: a psychological intervention (problem solving therapy versus supportive counselling) and an exercise intervention (behavioural exercise versus psychoeducation). Structured assessments occur at baseline, mid-point, end-point (6 weeks) and at a 6- and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes are depression and anxiety symptoms as measured by the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories. Secondary outcomes include remission (defined as no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria for a disorder if threshold level was reached at baseline, or no longer scoring in the clinical range on scale scores if sub-threshold at baseline), substance use, and functioning.Discussion: The effectiveness of less complex psychological and exercise interventions in young help-seekers with sub-threshold or mild to moderate presentations of high prevalence disorders is yet to be explored. This study has been designed to examine the effectiveness of these interventions delivered alone, or in combination, in a youth-specific service. If effective, the interventions have the potential to prevent the progression of early symptoms and distress to later and potentially more serious stages of mental disorder and reduce the likelihood of ongoing problems associated with the risk of persistence and recurrence.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12608000550303.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Major depression is a disabling psychiatric illness with complex origins. Life stress (childhood adversity and recent stressful events) is a robust risk factor for depression. The relationship between life stress and Val66Met polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene has received much attention. The aim of the present work was to review and conduct a meta-analysis on the results from published studies examining this interaction.Methods: A literature search was conducted using PsychINFO and PubMed databases until 22 November 2013. A total of 22 studies with a pooled total of 14,233 participants met the inclusion criteria, the results of which were combined and a meta-analysis performed using the Liptak-Stouffer z-score method.Results: The results suggest that the Met allele of BDNF Val66Met significantly moderates the relationship between life stress and depression (P = 0.03). When the studies were stratified by type of environmental stressor, the evidence was stronger for an interaction with stressful life events (P = 0.01) and weaker for interaction of BDNF Val66Met with childhood adversity (P = 0.051).Conclusions: The interaction between BDNF and life stress in depression is stronger for stressful life events rather than childhood adversity. Methodological limitations of existing studies include poor measurement of life stress.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine strategies for developing effective interventions for clients who have both serious mental illness and posttraumatic symptoms. METHODS: The authors conducted searches for articles published between 1970 and 2000, using MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and PILOTS. They assessed current practices, interviewed consumers and providers, and examined published and unpublished documents from consumer groups and state mental health authorities. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to trauma, particularly violent victimization, is endemic among clients with severe mental illness. Multiple psychiatric and behavioral problems are associated with trauma, but posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common and best-defined consequence of trauma. Mental health consumers and providers have expressed concerns about several trauma-related issues, including possible underdiagnosis of PTSD, misdiagnosis of other psychiatric disorders among trauma survivors, incidents of retraumatization in the mental health treatment system, and inadequate treatment for trauma-related disorders. Despite consensus that trauma and PTSD symptoms should be routinely evaluated, valid assessment techniques are not generally used by mental health care providers. PTSD is often untreated among clients with serious mental illness, or it is treated with untested interventions. It is important that policy makers, service system administrators, and providers recognize the prevalence and impact of trauma in the lives of people with severe mental illness. The development of effective treatments for this population requires a rational, orderly process, beginning with the testing of theoretically grounded interventions in controlled clinical trials.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression. However, CBT is a complex therapy that requires highly trained and qualified practitioners, and its scalability is therefore limited by the costs of training and employing sufficient therapists to meet demand. Behavioural activation (BA) is a psychological treatment for depression that may be an effective alternative to CBT and, because it is simpler, might also be delivered by less highly trained and specialised mental health workers.Methods/design: COBRA is a two-arm, non-inferiority, patient-level randomised controlled trial, including clinical, economic, and process evaluations comparing CBT delivered by highly trained professional therapists to BA delivered by junior professional or para-professional mental health workers to establish whether the clinical effectiveness of BA is non-inferior to CBT and if BA is cost effective compared to CBT. Four hundred and forty patients with major depressive disorder will be recruited through screening in primary care. We will analyse for non-inferiority in per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations. Our primary outcome will be severity of depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) at 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be clinically significant change and severity of depression at 18 months, and anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey-36) at 12 and 18 months. Our economic evaluation will take the United Kingdom National Health Service/Personal Social Services perspective to include costs of the interventions, health and social care services used, plus productivity losses. Cost-effectiveness will explored in terms of quality-adjusted life years using the EuroQol-5D measure of health-related quality of life.Discussion: The clinical and economic outcomes of this trial will provide the evidence to help policy makers, clinicians and guideline developers decide on the merits of including BA as a first-line treatment of depression.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN27473954.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Work-related stress is associated with a variety of mental and emotional problems and can lead to substantial economic costs due to lost productivity, absenteeism or the inability to work. There is a considerable amount of evidence on the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face stress-management interventions for employees; however, they are often costly, time-consuming, and characterized by a high access threshold. Web-based interventions may overcome some of these problems yet the evidence in this field is scarce. This paper describes the protocol for a study that will examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based guided stress-management training which is based on problem solving and emotion regulation and aimed at reducing stress in adult employees.Methods: The study will target stressed employees aged 18 and older. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be applied. Based on a power calculation of d=.35 (1-β of 80%, α = .05), 264 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. Inclusion criteria include an elevated stress level (Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale-10 ≥ 22) and current employment. Exclusion criteria include risk of suicide or previously diagnosed psychosis or dissociative symptoms. The primary outcome will be perceived stress, and secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety. Data will be collected at baseline and seven weeks and six months after randomization. An extended follow up at 12 months is planned for the intervention group. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect health care costs. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.Discussion: The substantial negative consequences of work-related stress emphasize the necessity for effective stress-management trainings. If the proposed internet intervention proves to be (cost-) effective, a preventative, economical stress-management tool will be conceivable. The strengths and limitations of the present study are discussed.Trial Registration: German Register of Clinical Studies (DRKS): DRKS00004749.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a cost-effective psychosocial prevention programme that helps people with recurrent depression stay well in the long term. It was singled out in the 2009 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Depression Guideline as a key priority for implementation. Despite good evidence and guideline recommendations, its roll-out and accessibility across the UK appears to be limited and inequitably distributed. The study aims to describe the current state of MBCT accessibility and implementation across the UK, develop an explanatory framework of what is hindering and facilitating its progress in different areas, and develop an Implementation Plan and related resources to promote better and more equitable availability and use of MBCT within the UK National Health Service.Methods/design: This project is a two-phase qualitative, exploratory and explanatory research study, using an interview survey and in-depth case studies theoretically underpinned by the Promoting Action on Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework. Interviews will be conducted with stakeholders involved in commissioning, managing and implementing MBCT services in each of the four UK countries, and will include areas where MBCT services are being implemented successfully and where implementation is not working well. In-depth case studies will be undertaken on a range of MBCT services to develop a detailed understanding of the barriers and facilitators to implementation. Guided by the study's conceptual framework, data will be synthesized across Phase 1 and Phase 2 to develop a fit for purpose implementation plan.Discussion: Promoting the uptake of evidence-based treatments into routine practice and understanding what influences these processes has the potential to support the adoption and spread of nationally recommended interventions like MBCT. This study could inform a larger scale implementation trial and feed into future implementation of MBCT with other long-term conditions and associated co-morbidities. It could also inform the implementation of interventions that are acceptable and effective, but are not widely accessible or implemented.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and, although efficacious treatments are available, their efficacy is suboptimal and recurrence of symptoms is common. Effective preventive strategies could reduce disability and the long term social and health complications associated with the disorder, but current options are limited. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, simple, and safe intervention that addresses attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if CBM decreases the one-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal depression.Design and Methods: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 532 adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression living in the Australian community (parallel design, 1:1 allocation ratio). Participants will be free of clinically significant symptoms of depression and of psychotic disorders, sensory and cognitive impairment, and risky alcohol use. The CBM intervention will target attentional and interpretive biases associated with depressive symptoms. The sessions will be delivered via the internet over a period of 52 weeks. The primary outcome of interest is the onset of a major depressive episode according the DSM-IV-TR criteria over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes of interest include change in the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and changes in attention and interpretive biases. The assessment of outcomes will take place 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation and will occur via the internet.Discussion: We propose to test the efficacy of an innovative intervention that is well grounded in theory and for which increasing empirical evidence for an effect on mood is available. The intervention is simple, inexpensive, easy to access, and could be easily rolled out into practice if our findings confirm a role for CBM in the prevention of depression.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613001334796.

        <ab>Background: Challenges remain to find ways to support patients with depression who have low levels of physical activity (PA) to overcome perceived barriers and enhance the perceived value of PA for preventing future relapse. There is an evidence-base for behavioural activation (BA) for depression, which focuses on supporting patients to restore activities that have been avoided, but practitioners have no specific training in promoting PA. We aimed to design and evaluate an integrated BA and PA (BAcPAc) practitioner-led, written, self-help intervention to enhance both physical and mental health.Methods/design: This study is informed by the Medical Research Council Complex Intervention Framework and describes a protocol for a pilot phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the feasibility and acceptability of the trial methods to inform a definitive phase III RCT. Following development of the augmented written self-help intervention (BAcPAc) incorporating behavioural activation with physical activity promotion, depressed adults are randomised to receive up to 12 sessions over a maximum of 4 months of either BAcPAc or behavioural activation alone within a written self-help format, which represents treatment as usual. The study is located within two 'Improving Access to Psychological Therapies' services in South West England, with both written self-help interventions supported by mental health paraprofessionals. Measures assessed at 4, 9, and 12 month follow-up include the following: CIS-R, PHQ-9, accelerometer recorded (4 months only) and self-reported PA, body mass index, blood pressure, Insomnia Severity Index, quality of life, and health and social care service use. Process evaluation will include analysis of recorded support sessions and patient and practitioner interviews. At the time of writing the study has recruited 60 patients.Discussion: The feasibility outcomes will inform a definitive RCT to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the augmented BAcPAc written self-help intervention to reduce depression and depressive relapse, and bring about improvements across a range of physical health outcomes.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN74390532, 26.03.2013.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Forensic mental health services have largely ignored examining patients' views on the nature of the services offered to them. A structured communication approach (DIALOG) has been developed with the aim of placing the patient's perspective on their care at the heart of the discussions between patients and clinicians. The effectiveness of the structured communication approach in community mental health services has been demonstrated, but no trial has taken place in a secure psychiatric setting. This pilot study is evaluating a 6-month intervention combining DIALOG with principles of solution-focused therapy on quality of life in medium-secure settings.Methods and Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial design is being employed to conduct a 36-month pilot study. Participants are recruited from six medium-secure inpatient services, with 48 patients in the intervention group and 48 in the control group. The intervention uses a structured communication approach. It comprises six meetings between patient and nurse held monthly over a 6-month period. During each meeting, patients rate their satisfaction with a range of life and treatment domains with responses displayed on a tablet. The rating is followed by a discussion of how to improve the current situation in those domains identified by the patient. Assessments take place prior to the intervention (baseline), at 6 months (postintervention) and at 12 months (follow-up). The primary outcome is the patient's self-reported quality of life.Discussion: This study aims to (1) establish the feasibility of the trial design as the basis for determining the viability of a large full-scale trial, (2) determine the variability of the outcomes of interest (quality of life, levels of satisfaction, disturbance, ward climate and engagement with services), (3) estimate the costs of the intervention and (4) refine the intervention following the outcome of the study based upon the experiences of the nurses and patients. The intervention allows patients to have a greater say in how they are treated and targets care in areas that patients identify as important to them. It is intended to establish systems that support meaningful patient and caregiver involvement and participation.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN34145189.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In the United Kingdom, clinical guidelines recommend that services for depression and anxiety should be structured around a stepped care model, where patients receive treatment at different 'steps,' with the intensity of treatment (i.e., the amount and type) increasing at each step if they fail to benefit at previous steps. There are very limited data available on the implementation of this model, particularly on the intensity of psychological treatment at each step. Our objective was to describe patient pathways through stepped care services and the impact of this on patient flow and management.Methods: We recorded service design features of four National Health Service sites implementing stepped care (e.g., the types of treatments available and their links with other treatments), together with the actual treatments received by individual patients and their transitions between different treatment steps. We computed the proportions of patients accessing, receiving, and transiting between the various steps and mapped these proportions visually to illustrate patient movement.Results: We collected throughput data on 7,698 patients referred. Patient pathways were highly complex and very variable within and between sites. The ratio of low (e.g., self-help) to high-intensity (e.g., cognitive behaviour therapy) treatments delivered varied between sites from 22:1, through 2.1:1, 1.4:1 to 0.5:1. The numbers of patients allocated directly to high-intensity treatment varied from 3% to 45%. Rates of stepping up from low-intensity treatment to high-intensity treatment were less than 10%.Conclusions: When services attempt to implement the recommendation for stepped care in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines, there were significant differences in implementation and consequent high levels of variation in patient pathways. Evaluations driven by the principles of implementation science (such as targeted planning, defined implementation strategies, and clear activity specification around service organisation) are required to improve evidence on the most effective, efficient, and acceptable stepped care systems.</ab>

        <ab>This paper briefly reviews the research literature on motivational interviewing (MI) and behaviour change in adolescents and then discusses the implications of adolescent cognitive and social-emotional developmental processes for the relational and technical components of MI. Research suggests that MI is efficacious in improving substance use in adolescents. Research has been slower to emerge in other behaviours, but available randomized controlled trials suggest that MI has great promise for improving mental and physical health outcomes in this developmental period. The relational and technical components of MI are highly relevant for the adolescent developmental period, and studies have shown that these components are related to outcomes in this population. There are several ways to include MI in clinical interventions for adolescents, ranging from MI in brief settings to using MI as a platform from which all other treatments are offered. Future research is necessary to test the effects of MI in adolescent group settings and the full integration of MI into other adolescent treatment approaches.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Recent studies in North American contexts have suggested that the Housing First model is a promising strategy for providing effective services to homeless people with mental illness. In the context of the highly generous French national health and social care system, which is easily accessible and does not require out-of-pocket payment, the French Health Ministry insists on rigorous techniques, including randomized protocols, to evaluate the impact of Housing First approaches in France.Method and Design: A prospective randomized trial was designed to assess the impact of a Housing First intervention on health outcomes and costs over a period of 24 months on homeless people with severe mental illness, compared to Treatment-As-Usual. The study is being conducted in four cities in France: Lille, Marseille, Paris and Toulouse. The inclusion criteria are as follows: over 18 years of age, absolutely homeless or in precarious housing, and possessing a 'high' level of need: diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and moderate to severe disability according to the Multnomah Community Ability Scale (score ≤ 62) and at least one of the following three criteria: 1) having been hospitalized for mental illness two or more times in any one year during the preceding five years; 2) co-morbid alcohol or substance use; and 3) having been recently arrested or incarcerated. Participants will be randomized to receiving the Housing First intervention or Treatment-As-Usual. The Housing First intervention provides immediate access to independent housing and community care. The primary outcome criterion is the use of high-cost health services (that is,, number of hospital admissions and number of emergency department visits) during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures include health outcomes, social functioning, housing stability and contact with police services. An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of Housing First will also be conducted. A total of 300 individuals per group will be included.Discussion: This is the first study to examine the impact of a Housing First intervention compared to Treatment-As-Usual in France. It should provide key information to policymakers concerning the cost-effectiveness and health outcomes of the Housing First model in the French context.Trial Registration: The current clinical trial number is NCT01570712.</ab>

        <ab>Background: People with mental illness are more likely to suffer physical health problems than comparable populations who do not have mental illness. There is evidence to suggest that exercise, as well has having obvious physical benefits, also has positive effects on mental health. There is a distinct paucity of research testing its effects on young people seeking help for mental health issues. Additionally, it is generally found that compliance with prescribed exercise programmes is low. As such, encouraging young people to exercise at levels recommended by national guidelines may be unrealistic considering their struggle with mental health difficulties. It is proposed that an exercise intervention tailored to young people's preferred intensity may improve mental health outcomes, overall quality of life, and reduce exercise attrition rates.Methods/design: A sequential mixed methods design will be utilised to assess the effectiveness of an individually tailored exercise programme on the mental health outcomes of young people with depression. The mixed methods design incorporates a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), focus groups and interviews and an economic evaluation.Participants: 158 young people (14-17 years) recruited from primary care and voluntary services randomly allocated to either the intervention group or control group. Intervention group: PARTICIPANTS will undertake a 12 week exercise programme of 12 × 60 minutes of preferred intensity aerobic exercise receiving motivational coaching and support throughout. PARTICIPANTS will also be invited to attend focus groups and 1-1 interviews following completion of the exercise programme to illicit potential barriers facilitators to participation.Control Group: PARTICIPANTS will receive treatment as usual.Primary Outcome Measure: Depression using the Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI-2).Secondary Outcome Measures: Quality of Life (EQ-5D), physical fitness (Borg RPE scale, heart rate), incidents of self-harm, treatment received and compliance with treatment, and the cost effectiveness of the intervention. Outcome measures will be taken at baseline, post intervention and 6 month follow up.Discussion: The results of this study will inform policy makers of the effectiveness of preferred intensity exercise on the mental health outcomes of young people with depression, the acceptability of such an intervention to this population and its cost effectiveness.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01474837.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Marital circumstances have been indicated to be a salient risk factor for disproportionately high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Pakistani women. Although social support is a known buffer of psychological distress, there is no clear evidence as to how different aspects of marital relations interact and associate with depression and anxiety in the lives of Pakistani married women and the role of social supports in the context of their marriage.Methods: Two hundred seventy seven married women were recruited from Rawalpindi district of Pakistan using a door knocking approach to psychometrically evaluate five scales for use in the Pakistani context. A confirmatory factor analysis approach was used to investigate the underlying factor structure of Couple satisfaction Index (CSI-4), Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWMAT), Relationship Dynamic Scale (RDS), Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The interplay of the constructs underlying the three aspects of marital relations, and the role of social support on the mental health of married Pakistani women were examined using the Structural Equation Model.Results: The factor structures of MSPSS, CSI-4, LWMAT, RDS and HADS were similar to the findings reported in the developed and developing countries. Perceived higher social support reduces the likelihood of depression and anxiety by enhancing positive relationship as reflected by a low score on the relationship dynamics scale which decreases CMD symptoms. Moreover, perceived higher social support is positively associated with marital adjustment directly and indirectly through relationship dynamics which is associated with the reduced risk of depression through the increased level of reported marital satisfaction. Nuclear family structure, low level of education and higher socio-economic status were significantly associated with increased risk of mental illness among married women.Conclusion: Findings of this study support the importance of considering elements of marital relationship: satisfaction, adjustment and negative interactions which can be prioritized to increase the efficiency of marital interventions. It also highlights the role of social support in the context of marital relationships among Pakistani women. Furthermore, the study presents the etiological models of depression and anxiety with reference to the above.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Evidence-based treatments for child mental health problems are not consistently available in public mental health settings. Expanding availability requires workforce training. However, research has demonstrated that training alone is not sufficient for changing provider behavior, suggesting that ongoing intervention-specific supervision or consultation is required. Supervision is notably under-investigated, particularly as provided in public mental health. The degree to which supervision in this setting includes 'gold standard' supervision elements from efficacy trials (e.g., session review, model fidelity, outcome monitoring, skill-building) is unknown. The current federally-funded investigation leverages the Washington State Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Initiative to describe usual supervision practices and test the impact of systematic implementation of gold standard supervision strategies on treatment fidelity and clinical outcomes.Methods/design: The study has two phases. We will conduct an initial descriptive study (Phase I) of supervision practices within public mental health in Washington State followed by a randomized controlled trial of gold standard supervision strategies (Phase II), with randomization at the clinician level (i.e., supervisors provide both conditions). Study participants will be 35 supervisors and 130 clinicians in community mental health centers. We will enroll one child per clinician in Phase I (N = 130) and three children per clinician in Phase II (N = 390). We use a multi-level mixed within- and between-subjects longitudinal design. Audio recordings of supervision and therapy sessions will be collected and coded throughout both phases. Child outcome data will be collected at the beginning of treatment and at three and six months into treatment.Discussion: This study will provide insight into how supervisors can optimally support clinicians delivering evidence-based treatments. Phase I will provide descriptive information, currently unavailable in the literature, about commonly used supervision strategies in community mental health. The Phase II randomized controlled trial of gold standard supervision strategies is, to our knowledge, the first experimental study of gold standard supervision strategies in community mental health and will yield needed information about how to leverage supervision to improve clinician fidelity and client outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01800266.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric disorders and are the cause of a large and increasing amount of sick-leave in most developed countries. They are also implicated as an increasing mortality risk in community surveys. In this study we addressed, whether sick leave due to anxiety, depression or comorbid anxiety and depression was associated with increased risk of retirement due to permanent disability and increased mortality in a cohort of German workers.Methods: 128,001 German workers with statutory health insurance were followed for a mean of 6.4 years. We examined the associations between 1) depression/anxiety-related sick leave managed on an outpatient basis and 2) anxiety/depression-related psychiatric inpatient treatment, and later permanent disability/mortality using Cox proportional hazard regression models (stratified by sex and disorder) adjusted for age, education and job code classification.Results: Outpatient-managed depression/anxiety-related sick leave was significantly associated with higher permanent disability (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)) 1.48 (1.30, 1.69) for depression, 1.25 (1.07, 1.45) for anxiety, 1.91 (1.56, 2.35) for both). Among outpatients, comorbidly ill men (2.59 (1.97,3.41)) were more likely to retire early than women (1.42 (1.04,1.93)). Retirement rates were higher for depressive and comorbidly ill patients who needed inpatient treatment (depression 3.13 (2,51, 3,92), both 3.54 (2.80, 4.48)). Inpatient-treated depression was also associated with elevated mortality (2.50 (1.80, 3.48)). Anxiety (0.53 (0.38, 0.73)) and female outpatients with depression (0.61 (0.38, 0.97)) had reduced mortality compared to controls.Conclusions: Depression/anxiety diagnoses increase the risk of early retirement; comorbidity and severity further increase that risk, depression more strikingly than anxiety. Sickness-absence diagnoses of anxiety/depression identified a population at high risk of retiring early due to ill health, suggesting a target group for the development of interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is one of the more severe and serious health problems because of its morbidity, disabling effects and for its societal and economic burden. Despite the variety of existing pharmacological and psychological treatments, most of the cases evolve with only partial remission, relapse and recurrence.Cognitive models have contributed significantly to the understanding of unipolar depression and its psychological treatment. However, success is only partial and many authors affirm the need to improve those models and also the treatment programs derived from them. One of the issues that requires further elaboration is the difficulty these patients experience in responding to treatment and in maintaining therapeutic gains across time without relapse or recurrence. Our research group has been working on the notion of cognitive conflict viewed as personal dilemmas according to personal construct theory. We use a novel method for identifying those conflicts using the repertory grid technique (RGT). Preliminary results with depressive patients show that about 90% of them have one or more of those conflicts. This fact might explain the blockage and the difficult progress of these patients, especially the more severe and/or chronic. These results justify the need for specific interventions focused on the resolution of these internal conflicts. This study aims to empirically test the hypothesis that an intervention focused on the dilemma(s) specifically detected for each patient will enhance the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression.Design: A therapy manual for a dilemma-focused intervention will be tested using a randomized clinical trial by comparing the outcome of two treatment conditions: combined group CBT (eight, 2-hour weekly sessions) plus individual dilemma-focused therapy (eight, 1-hour weekly sessions) and CBT alone (eight, 2-hour group weekly sessions plus eight, 1-hour individual weekly sessions).Method: Participants are patients aged over 18 years meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder, with a score of 19 or above on the Beck depression inventory, second edition (BDI-II) and presenting at least one cognitive conflict (implicative dilemma or dilemmatic construct) as assessed using the RGT. The BDI-II is the primary outcome measure, collected at baseline, at the end of therapy, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up; other secondary measures are also used.Discussion: We expect that adding a dilemma-focused intervention to CBT will increase the efficacy of one of the more prestigious therapies for depression, thus resulting in a significant contribution to the psychological treatment of depression.Trial Registration: ISRCTN92443999; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01542957.</ab>

        <ab>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly seen arrhythmia in clinical practice. At present, few studies have been conducted centering on depression and anxiety in AF patients. Our aim in this systematic review is to use the relevant literature to (1) describe the prevalence of depression and anxiety in AF patients, (2) assess the impact that depression and anxiety have on illness perception in patients with AF, (3) provide evidence to support a hypothetical connection between the pathophysiology of AF and depression and anxiety, (4) evaluate the benefit of treatment of AF on depression and anxiety, and (5) give insight on medically managing a patient with AF and concomitant depression and anxiety.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Several studies suggest that the number of risk factors rather than their nature is key to mental health disorders in childhood.Method and Design: The objective of this multicentre randomized controlled parallel trial (PROBE methodology) is to assess the impact in a multi-risk French urban sample of a home-visiting program targeting child mental health and its major determinants. This paper describes the protocol of this study. In the study, pregnant women were eligible if they were: living in the intervention area; able to speak French, less than 26 years old; having their first child; less than 27 weeks of amenorrhea; and if at least one of the following criteria were true: less than twelve years of education, intending to bring up their child without the presence of the child's father, and 3) low income. Participants were randomized into either the intervention or the control group. All had access to usual care in mother-child centres and community mental health services free of charge in every neighbourhood. Psychologists conducted all home visits, which were planned on a weekly basis from the 7th month of pregnancy and progressively decreasing in frequency until the child's second birthday. Principle outcome measures included child mental health at 24 months and two major mediating variables for infant mental health: postnatal maternal depression and the quality of the caring environment. A total of 440 families were recruited, of which a subsample of 120 families received specific attachment and caregiver behaviour assessment. Assessment was conducted by an independent assessment team during home visits and, for the attachment study, in a specifically created Attachment Assessment laboratory.Discussion: The CAPEDP study is the first large-scale randomised, controlled infant mental health promotion programme to take place in France. A major specificity of the program was that all home visits were conducted by specifically trained, supervised psychologists rather than nurses. Significant challenges included designing a mental health promotion programme targeting vulnerable families within one of the most generous but little assessed health and social care systems in the Western World.Trial Registration: Current Clinical trial number is NCT00392847.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Trafficking in women is a widespread human rights violation commonly associated with poor mental health. Yet, to date, no studies have used psychiatric diagnostic assessment to identify common forms of mental distress among survivors returning to their home country.Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted of women aged 18 and over who returned to Moldova between December 2007 and December 2008 registered by the International Organisation for Migration as a survivor of human trafficking. Psychiatric diagnoses in women at a mean of 6 months after return (range 2-12 months) were made by a trained Moldavian psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and compared with diagnoses recorded in the same women within 5 days of return. We described the socio-demographic characteristics of the women in the sample including both pre and post-trafficking information. We then described the distribution of mental health diagnoses recorded during the crisis intervention phase (1-5 days after return) and the re-integration phase (2-12 months after return). We compared diagnoses at the patient level between the two time points by tabulating the diagnoses and carrying out a kappa test of agreement and the Stuart-Maxwell test for marginal homogeneity (an extension of the McNemar test to kxk table).Results: 120/176 (68%) eligible women participated. At 2-12 months after their return, 54% met criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnoses comprising post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone (16%); co-morbid PTSD (20%); other anxiety or mood disorder (18%). 85% of women who had been diagnosed in the crisis phase with co-morbid PTSD or with another anxiety or mood disorder sustained a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder when followed up during rehabilitation.Conclusions: Trafficked women returning to their country of origin are likely to suffer serious psychological distress that may endure well beyond the time they return. Women found to have co-morbid PTSD or other forms of anxiety and depression immediately post-return should be offered evidenced-based mental health treatment for at least the standard 12-month period of rehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression in adolescents seems to be a growing problem that causes mental suffering and prevents young people from joining the workforce. There is also a high risk of relapse during adult life. There is emerging evidence for the effect of psychodynamic psychotherapy in adolescents. In-session relational intervention (that is, transference intervention) is a key component of psychodynamic psychotherapy. However, whether depressed adolescents profit most from psychodynamic psychotherapy with or without transference interventions has not been stated. Object: The effect of transference interventions in depressed adolescents and the moderator moderating effect of quality of object relations, personality disorder and gender will be explored. Methods and Study Design: The First Experimental Study of Transference Work-In Teenagers (FEST-IT) will be a randomized clinical trial with a dismantling design. The study is aimed to explore the effects of transference work in psychodynamic psychotherapy for adolescents with depression. One hundred patients ages 16 to 18 years old will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, in both of which general psychodynamic techniques will be used. The patients will be treated over 28 weeks with either a moderate level of transference intervention or no transference intervention. Follow-up will be at 1 year after treatment termination. The outcome measures will be the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (PFS), Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-Circumplex Version (IIP-C), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and the total mean score of Symptom Checklist-90 (Global Severity Index; GSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Montgomery Åsberg Rating Scale (MADRS). The quality of adolescents' relationships will be a central focus of the study, and the Adolescent Relationship Scales (ARS) and Differentiation-Relatedness Scale (DRS) will also be used. Change will be assessed using linear-mixed models. Gender personality disorder (PD) and quality of object relations (QOR) will be the preselected putative moderators. Discussion: The object of this clinical trial is to explore the effect of transference interventions in psychodynamic psychotherapy in adolescents with a major depressive disorder. Using a randomized and dismantling design, we hope that the study will add more specific knowledge to the evidence base.

        <ab>Background: Very little research has been conducted in the area of depression among older home care clients using personal support services. These older adults are particularly vulnerable to depression because of decreased cognition, comorbid chronic conditions, functional limitations, lack of social support, and reduced access to health services. To date, research has focused on collaborative, nurse-led depression care programs among older adults in primary care settings. Optimal management of depression among older home care clients is not currently known. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a 6-month nurse-led, interprofessional mental health promotion intervention aimed at older home care clients with depressive symptoms using personal support services.Methods/design: This one-group pre-test post-test study aims to recruit a total of 250 long-stay (&gt; 60 days) home care clients, 70 years or older, with depressive symptoms who are receiving personal support services through a home care program in Ontario, Canada. The nurse-led intervention is a multi-faceted 6-month program led by a Registered Nurse that involves regular home visits, monthly case conferences, and evidence-based assessment and management of depression using an interprofessional approach. The primary outcome is the change in severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to 6 months using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies in Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include changes in the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety, health-related quality of life, cognitive function, and the rate and appropriateness of depression treatment from baseline to 12 months. Changes in the costs of use of health services will be assessed from a societal perspective. Descriptive and qualitative data will be collected to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation.Discussion: Data collection began in May 2010 and is expected to be completed by July 2012. A collaborative nurse-led strategy may provide a feasible, acceptable and effective means for improving the health of older home care clients by improving the prevention, recognition, and management of depression in this vulnerable population. The challenges involved in designing a practical, transferable and sustainable nurse-led intervention in home care are also discussed.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01407926.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Closure of asylums and institutions for the mentally ill, coupled with government policies focusing on reducing the number of hospital beds for people with severe mental illness in favor of providing care in a variety of nonhospital settings, underpins the rationale behind care in the community. A major thrust toward community care has been the development of community mental health teams.</ab>

        <ab>Background: In unipolar, and bipolar affective disorders, there is a high risk of relapse that increases as the number of episodes increases. Naturalistic follow-up studies suggest that the progressive development of the diseases is not prevented with the present treatment modalities. It is not known whether centralised and specialised secondary care intervention initiated early after the onset of the diseases can prevent the progression and thereby improve the prognosis.Methods: Two randomised clinical multi-centre trials comparing a centralised and specialised outpatient intervention program consisting of combined pharmacological and psychological intervention with standard decentralised psychiatric treatment. Patients discharged from their first, second, or third hospitalisation due to a manic episode or bipolar disorder (trial 1) or to a single depressive episode or recurrent depressive disorder (trial 2) were randomised. Central randomization for both trials were stratified for the number of hospitalisations and treatment centre. The primary outcome measure for the two trials is time to re-hospitalisation with an affective episode.Discussion: These trials are the first to evaluate the effect of a centralised and specialised intervention in patients with early severe affective disorders. The trials used a pragmatic design comparing a specialised mood disorder clinic intervention with decentralised, non-specialised standard psychiatric treatment.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00253071.</ab>

        <ab>Background: For Norwegian general practitioners (GPs), acute treatment of mental illness and substance abuse are among the most commonly experienced emergency situations in out-of-hours primary healthcare. The largest share of acute referrals to emergency psychiatric wards occurs out-of-hours, and out-of-hours services are responsible for a disproportionately high share of compulsory referrals. Concerns exist regarding the quality of mental healthcare provided in the out-of-hours setting. The aim of this study was to explore which challenges GPs experience when providing emergency care out-of-hours to patients presenting problems related to mental illness or substance abuse.Methods: We conducted a qualitative study based on two individual interviews and six focus groups with purposively sampled GPs (totally 45 participants). The interviews were analysed successively in an editing style, using a thematic approach based on methodological descriptions by Charmaz and Malterud.Results: Safety and uncertainty were the dominating themes in the discussions. The threat to personal safety due to unpredictable patient behaviour was a central concern, and present security precautions in the out-of-hours services were questioned. The GPs expressed high levels of uncertainty in their work with patients presenting problems related to mental illness or substance abuse. The complexity of the problems presented, shortage of time, limited access to reliable information and limited range of interventions available during out-of-hours contributed to this uncertainty. Perceived access to second opinion seemed to have a major impact on subjectively experienced work stress.Conclusions: The GPs experienced out-of-hours psychiatry as a field with high levels of uncertainty and limited support to help them meet the experienced challenges. This might influence the quality of care provided. If the current organisation of emergency mental healthcare is to be kept, we need to provide GPs with a better support framework out-of-hours.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Major depression is a common mental health problem in the general population, associated with a substantial impact on quality of life and societal costs. However, many depressed patients in primary care do not receive the care they need. Reason for this is that pharmacotherapy is only effective in severely depressed patients and psychological treatments in primary care are scarce and costly. A more feasible treatment in primary care might be computerised cognitive behavioural therapy. This can be a self-help computer program based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy. Although previous studies suggest that computerised cognitive behavioural therapy is effective, more research is necessary. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of online computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression in primary care. Methods/Design: In a randomised trial we will compare (a) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy with (b) treatment as usual by a GP, and (c) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy in combination with usual GP care. Three hundred mild to moderately depressed patients (aged 18-65) will be recruited in the general population by means of a large-scale Internet-based screening (N = 200,000). Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups. Primary outcome measure of the clinical evaluation is the severity of depression. Other outcomes include psychological distress, social functioning, and dysfunctional beliefs. The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective, in which all costs will be related to clinical effectiveness and health-related quality of life. All outcome assessments will take place on the Internet at baseline, two, three, six, nine, and twelve months. Costs are measured on a monthly basis. A time horizon of one year will be used without long-term extrapolation of either costs or quality of life. Discussion: Although computerised cognitive behavioural therapy is a promising treatment for depression in primary care, more research is needed. The effectiveness of online computerised cognitive behavioural therapy without support remains to be evaluated as well as the effects of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy in combination with usual GP care. Economic evaluation is also needed. Methodological strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Trial registration: The study has been registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre (ISRCTN47481236).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Although Primary Health Care (PHC) Teams are used to deal with prevention and treatment of sanitary problems in adults with chronic diseases, they usually have a lack of experience in development of psychotherapeutic interventions. However, these interventions are the ones that achieve better results to reduce symptomatology and improve emotional state of caregivers.The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention of psychotherapy in improving the mental health and Quality of life of caregivers. This intervention is based on theoretical approaches to care adjusted to cognitive theory, in order to be applied in primary health care centres.Methods/design: This is multicentre clinical trials study, randomized in two parallel groups, carry out in two PHC, Study population: 150 caregivers will be included by consecutive sampling and they will be randomized the half to experimental group and the other half to control group. They provide mostly all the assistance to care-dependent familiars receiving attention in PHC Centers.Measurements: Each caregiver will be evaluated on a personal interview. The caregivers' assessment protocol: 1) Assessment of different socio-demographic related to care, and caregiver's personal situation. 2)Care-dependent individuals will also be assessed by Barthel Index and Pfeiffer Questionnaire (SPMSQ). 3)Change in caregivers will be the principal measure: family function (Family APGAR Questionnaire), burden short questionnaire (Short Zarit Burden Interview), quality of life (Ruiz &amp; Baca: 1993 Questionnaire), the Duke-UNK Functional Social Support Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire-12, and changes in Dysfunctional Thoughts about caring. 4) Intervention implementation measures will also be assessed.Intervention: A psychotherapeutic intervention will be 8 sessions of 90 minutes in groups. This intervention has been initially developed for family caregivers of patients with dementia.Discussion: Psychotherapeutic interventions have been proved to obtain better results to reduce symptomatology and improve emotional state of caregivers. Moreover, this intervention has been proved to be effective in a different setting other than PHC, and was developed by professionals of Mental Health. If we found that this intervention is effective in PHC and with our professionals, it would be an important instrument to offer to caregivers of care-dependent patients.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01177696.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Whilst evidence suggests cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may be effective for depressed older people in a primary care setting, few studies have examined its cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), a talking control (TC) and treatment as usual (TAU), delivered in a primary care setting, for older people with depression.Methods: Cost data generated from a single blind randomised controlled trial of 204 people aged 65 years or more were offered only Treatment as Usual, or TAU plus up to twelve sessions of CBT or a talking control is presented. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was the main outcome measure for depression. Direct treatment costs were compared with reductions in depression scores. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using non-parametric bootstrapping. The primary analysis focussed on the cost-effectiveness of CBT compared with TAU at 10 months follow up.Results: Complete cost data were available for 198 patients at 4 and 10 month follow up. There were no significant differences between groups in baseline costs. The majority of health service contacts at follow up were made with general practitioners. Fewer contacts with mental health services were recorded in patients allocated to CBT, though these differences were not significant. Overall total per patient costs (including intervention costs) were significantly higher in the CBT group compared with the TAU group at 10 month follow up (difference £427, 95% CI: £56 - £787, p &lt; 0.001). Reductions in BDI-II scores were significantly greater in the CBT group (difference 3.6 points, 95% CI: 0.7-6.5 points, p = 0.018). CBT is associated with an incremental cost of £120 per additional point reduction in BDI score and a 90% probability of being considered cost-effective if purchasers are willing to pay up to £270 per point reduction in the BDI-II score.Conclusions: CBT is significantly more costly than TAU alone or TAU plus TC, but more clinically effective. Based on current estimates, CBT is likely to be recommended as a cost-effective treatment option for this patient group if the value placed on a unit reduction in BDI-II is greater than £115.Trial Registration: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN18271323.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts are major public health problems worldwide. Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/design: In this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.Discussion: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts. Several limitations and strengths of the design are discussed.Trial Registration: Netherlands Trial Register, NTR1689.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Interventions are needed which can successfully modify more than one disease risk factor at a time, but much remains to be learned about the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of multiple risk factor (MRF) interventions. To address these issues and inform future intervention development, we conducted a randomized pilot trial (n = 52). This study was designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Step Up program, a MRF cognitive-behavioral program designed to improve participants' mental and physical well-being by reducing depressive symptoms, promoting smoking cessation, and increasing physical activity.Methods: Participants were recruited from a large health care organization and randomized to receive usual care treatment for depression, smoking, and physical activity promotion or the phone-based Step Up counseling program plus usual care. Participants were assessed at baseline, three and six months.Results: The intervention was acceptable to participants and feasible to offer within a healthcare system. The pilot also offered important insights into the optimal design of a MRF program. While not powered to detect clinically significant outcomes, changes in target behaviors indicated positive trends at six month follow-up and statistically significant improvement was also observed for depression. Significantly more experimental participants reported a clinically significant improvement (50% reduction) in their baseline depression score at four months (54% vs. 26%, OR = 3.35, 95% CI [1.01-12.10], p = 0.05) and 6 months (52% vs. 13%, OR = 7.27, 95% CI [1.85-37.30], p = 0.004)Conclusions: Overall, results suggest the Step Up program warrants additional research, although some program enhancements may be beneficial. Key lessons learned from this research are shared to promote the understanding of others working in this field.Trial Registration: The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00644995).</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is a common and distressing mental health problem that is responsible for significant individual disability and cost to society. Medication and psychological therapies are effective for treating depression and maintenance anti-depressants (m-ADM) can prevent relapse. However, individuals with depression often express a wish for psychological help that can help them recover from depression in the long-term. We need to develop psychological therapies that prevent depressive relapse/recurrence. A recently developed treatment, Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT, see http://www.mbct.co.uk) shows potential as a brief group programme for people with recurring depression. In two studies it has been shown to halve the rates of depression recurring compared to usual care.This trial asks the policy research question, is MBCT superior to m-ADM in terms of: a primary outcome of preventing depressive relapse/recurrence over 24 months; and, secondary outcomes of (a) depression free days, (b) residual depressive symptoms, (c) antidepressant (ADM) usage, (d) psychiatric and medical co-morbidity, (e) quality of life, and (f) cost effectiveness? An explanatory research question asks is an increase in mindfulness skills the key mechanism of change?Methods/design: The design is a single blind, parallel RCT examining MBCT vs. m-ADM with an embedded process study. To answer the main policy research question the proposed trial compares MBCT plus ADM-tapering with m-ADM for patients with recurrent depression. Four hundred and twenty patients with recurrent major depressive disorder in full or partial remission will be recruited through primary care. Depressive relapse/recurrence over two years is the primary outcome variable. The explanatory question will be addressed in two mutually informative ways: quantitative measurement of potential mediating variables pre/post-treatment and a qualitative study of service users' views and experiences.Discussion: If the results of our exploratory trial are extended to this definitive trial, MBCT will be established as an alternative approach to maintenance anti-depressants for people with a history of recurrent depression. The process studies will provide evidence about the effective components which can be used to improve MBCT and inform theory as well as other therapeutic approaches.Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN26666654.</ab>

        <ab>The study examines differences regarding quality of life (QoL), mental health and illness beliefs between in-centre haemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD/PD) patients. Differences are examined between patients who recently commenced treatment compared to patients on long term treatment.~Background~Background~144 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients were recruited from three treatment units, of which 135 provided full data on the variables studied. Patients consisted of: a) 77 in-centre haemodialysis (HD) and 58 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD/PD) patients, all currently being treated by dialysis for varied length of time. Patients were compared for differences after being grouped into those who recently commenced treatment (&lt; 4 years) and those on long term treatment (&gt; 4 years). Next, cases were selected as to form two equivalent groups of HD and CAPD/PD patients in terms of length of treatment and sociodemographic variables. The groups consisted of: a) 41 in-centre haemodialysis (HD) and b) 48 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD/PD) patients, fitting the selection criteria of recent commencement of treatment and similar sociodemographic characteristics. Patient-reported assessments included: WHOQOL-BREF, GHQ-28 and the MHLC, which is a health locus of control inventory.~Methods~Methods~Differences in mean scores were mainly observed in the HD patients with &gt; 4 years of treatment, providing lower mean scores in the QoL domains of physical health, social relationships and environment, as well as in overall mental health. Differences in CAPD/PD groups, between those in early and those in later years of treatment, were not found to be large and significant. Concerning the analysis on equivalent groups derived from selection of cases, HD patients indicated significantly lower mean scores in the QoL domain of environment and higher scores in the GHQ-28 subscales of anxiety/insomnia and severe depression, indicating more symptoms in these areas of mental health. With regards to illness beliefs, HD patients who recently commenced treatment provided higher mean scores in the dimension of internal health locus of control, while CAPD/PD patients on long term treatment indicated higher mean scores in the dimension of chance. Regarding differences in health beliefs between equivalent groups of HD and CAPD/PD patients, HD patients focused more on the dimension of internal health locus of control.~Results~Results~The results provide evidence that patients in HD treatment modality, particularly those with many years of treatment, were experiencing a more compromised QoL in comparison to CAPD/PD patients.~Conclusion~Conclusions</ab>

        <ab>A matched-case-control study compared eight-week outcomes between a group of 16 depressed women who received brief (eight-session) interpersonal psychotherapy and a group of 16 who received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline). Women who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression and who had a score above 15 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were treated openly with brief interpersonal psychotherapy and were matched on key variables with women being treated with sertraline. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to compare groups on measures of symptoms and functioning during eight weeks of treatment. Both groups improved significantly over time, with large effect sizes. However, contrary to expectations, the women who received psychotherapy improved more quickly than those who received sertraline.</ab>

        <ab>With deinstitutionalization and the influx into the community of persons with severe mental illness, the police have become frontline professionals who manage these persons when they are in crisis. This article examines and comments on the issues raised by this phenomenon as it affects both the law enforcement and mental health systems. Two common-law principles provide the rationale for the police to take responsibility for persons with mental illness: their power and authority to protect the safety and welfare of the community, and their parens patriae obligations to protect individuals with disabilities. The police often fulfill the role of gatekeeper in deciding whether a person with mental illness who has come to their attention should enter the mental health system or the criminal justice system. Criminalization may result if this role is not performed appropriately. The authors describe a variety of mobile crisis teams composed of police, mental health professionals, or both. The need for police officers to have training in recognizing mental illness and knowing how to access mental health resources is emphasized. Collaboration between the law enforcement and mental health systems is crucial, and the very different areas of expertise of each should be recognized and should not be confused.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: The recognition and treatment of depressive- and anxiety disorders is not always in line with current standards. The results of programs to improve the quality of care, are not encouraging. Perhaps these programs do not match with the problems experienced in family practice. This study aims to systematically explore how FPs perceive recognition, diagnosis and management of depressive and anxiety disorders. METHODS: focus group discussions with FPs, qualitative analysis of transcriptions using thematic coding. RESULTS: The FPs considered recognising, diagnosing and managing depressive- and anxiety disorders as an important task. They expressed serious doubts about the validity and usefulness of the DSM IV concept of depressive and anxiety disorders in family practice especially because of the high frequency of swift natural recovery. An important barrier was that many patients have difficulties in accepting the diagnosis and treatment with antidepressant drugs. FPs lacked guidance in the assessment of patients' burden. The FPs experienced they had too little time for patient education and counseling. The under capacity of specialised mental health care and its minimal collaboration with FPs were experienced as problematic. Valuable suggestions for solving the problems encountered were made CONCLUSION: Next to serious doubts regarding the diagnostic concept of depressive- and anxiety disorders a number of factors were identified which serve as barriers for suitablemental health care by FPs. These doubts and barriers should be taken into account in future research and in the design of interventions to improve mental health care in family practice.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Kinin B1 receptors are inducible molecules up-regulated after inflammatory stimuli. This study evaluated the relevance of kinin B1 receptors in a mouse depression behavior model.Methods: Mice were exposed to a 5-min swimming session, and 30 min later they were injected with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Depression-like behavior was assessed by determining immobility time in a tail suspension test. Different brain structures were collected for molecular and immunohistochemical studies. Anhedonia was assessed by means of a sucrose intake test.Results: Our protocol elicited an increase in depression-like behavior in CF1 mice, as assessed by the tail-suspension test, at 24 h. This behavior was significantly reduced by treatment with the selective B1 receptor antagonists R-715 and SSR240612. Administration of SSR240612 also prevented an increase in number of activated microglial cells in mouse hippocampus, but did not affect a reduction in expression of mRNA for brain-derived neurotrophic factor. The increased immobility time following LPS treatment was preceded by an enhancement of hippocampal and cortical B1 receptor mRNA expression (which were maximal at 1 h), and a marked production of TNFα in serum, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (between 1 and 6 h). The depression-like behavior was virtually abolished in TNFα p55 receptor-knockout mice, and increased B1 receptor mRNA expression was completely absent in this mouse strain. Furthermore, treatment with SSR240612 was also effective in preventing anhedonia in LPS-treated mice, as assessed using a sucrose preference test.Conclusion: Our data show, for the first time, involvement of kinin B1 receptors in depressive behavioral responses, in a process likely associated with microglial activation and TNFα production. Thus, selective and orally active B1 receptor antagonists might well represent promising pharmacological tools for depression therapy.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) - 12 was designed as a short questionnaire to assess psychiatric morbidity. Despite the fact that studies have suggested a number of competing multidimensional factor structures, it continues to be largely used as a unidimensional instrument. This may have an impact on the identification of psychiatric morbidity in target populations. The aim of this study was to explore the dimensionality of the GHQ-12 and to evaluate a number of alternative models for the instrument.Methods: The data were drawn from a large heterogeneous sample of cancer patients. The Partial Credit Model (Rasch) was applied to the 12-item GHQ. Item misfit (infit mean square &gt;or= 1.3) was identified, misfitting items removed and unidimensionality and differential item functioning (age, gender, and treatment aims) were assessed. The factor structures of the various alternative models proposed in the literature were explored and optimum model fit evaluated using Confirmatory Factor Analysis.Results: The Rasch analysis of the 12-item GHQ identified six misfitting items. Removal of these items produced a six-item instrument which was not unidimensional. The Rasch analysis of an 8-item GHQ demonstrated two unidimensional structures corresponding to Anxiety/Depression and Social Dysfunction. No significant differential item functioning was observed by age, gender and treatment aims for the six- and eight-item GHQ. Two models competed for best fit from the confirmatory factor analysis, namely the GHQ-8 and Hankin's (2008) unidimensional model, however, the GHQ-8 produced the best overall fit statistics.Conclusions: The results are consistent with the evidence that the GHQ-12 is a multi-dimensional instrument. Use of the summated scores for the GHQ-12 could potentially lead to an incorrect assessment of patients' psychiatric morbidity. Further evaluation of the GHQ-12 with different target populations is warranted.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The author sought to provide a contemporary understanding of depression in schizophrenia and promote a treatment orientation. METHOD: Computer and library-based resources were used to review the literature on depression in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Despite multiple definitions of 'depression,' a substantial rate of depression has consistently been found in patients with schizophrenia. A differential diagnosis can be used to advance the understanding and treatment of depression in schizophrenia, and changes in response to the advent of atypical antipsychotic agents can be understood in the context of this differential diagnosis paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: Depression is an important co-occurring syndrome in schizophrenia. In at least some schizophrenic patients, the stress-vulnerability model has potential as an integrating concept concerning the relationship between depression and psychosis.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND. Investigators from several states have reported that children entering foster care are at risk for medical and mental health conditions. Additional information based on data from a larger statewide population of children in foster care would assist in the development of appropriate strategies of care for these children. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this work was to describe the prevalence of medical and mental health conditions, the number of referrals for specialty care, the use of medications and to compare the prevalence of these conditions across age groups of children entering foster care in Utah. METHODS. We conducted an analysis of a statewide database containing abstracted medical and mental health information from the initial medical and mental health assessments of all children entering foster care between January 1, 2001, and December 16, 2004. RESULTS. Of the 6177 children who entered foster care during the study period, 83% were white and 24% were Hispanic. One or more acute or chronic medical conditions were present in 54%, and 44% had &gt;/=1 mental health condition. The most prevalent medical conditions in all of the children were overweight or obesity (35%), 30% had a referral for specialty care. The most prevalent mental health conditions were oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (18%), reactive attachment and adjustment disorders (17%), and mood disorders (15%). The frequency of psychotropic medication use increased with age. Of the 2747 children of all ages with a diagnosed mental health condition, 35% were receiving psychotropic medications. CONCLUSIONS. This study of a statewide cohort of children entering foster care supports and strengthens previous evidence that children in foster care are more likely to have more health care needs compared with the general pediatric population. Focused strategies are needed that address prevalent conditions, the need for continuity of care, ongoing mental health services, and medication management.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: Although cognitive behavior therapy is a widely accepted treatment for depression, the problematic nature of efficacy studies is insufficiently recognized. METHOD: The authors reviewed original studies and quantitative analyses on the use of cognitive behavior therapy for depression. RESULTS: The authors suggested that claims for cognitive behavior therapy's efficacy on depression have been overstated, questioned whether its efficacy fits within its theoretical underpinning, and argued against viewing cognitive behavior therapy as a universal rather than a targeted strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Although cognitive behavior therapy may act more by its nonspecific therapeutic ingredients, the authors argued that by testing cognitive behavior therapy's efficacy in heterogeneous study groups, rather than in specific subgroups, failure to differentiate it from control therapies may have been ensured.</ab>

        <ab>The research and practice literature was examined to determine whether community support programs are responsive to ethnocultural issues and to derive strategies for developing culturally relevant programming. Great variation exists across cultures in family practices, conceptions of mental illness, stigma attributed to mental illness, and expectations of the provider system. Ethnic minority cultures are typically centered on the family, whereas Western European cultures are characterized as more individualistic and as valuing independence. Research shows that some rehabilitation approaches based on Western models may produce adverse effects when used with patients from ethnic minority groups. Interventions that incorporate family networks and use group modalities are considered culturally congruent. Clients from sociocentric cultures may have strong support networks and display prosocial behaviors that can be tapped in the rehabilitation process. Community support programs should incorporate cultural factors into psychosocial assessments, train staff to conduct ethnographic interviews, and use focus groups to gain an understanding of the cultures of clients they serve.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the percentages of full remission in studies of patients with major depressive disorder in which pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and control conditions were directly compared. METHOD: Computerized searches of the MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases up to November 2000 were used to identify six multiple-cell randomized, controlled, double-blind trials for well-defined major depressive disorder in which medications, psychotherapy, and control conditions were directly compared and for which remission percentages were reported. RESULTS: The studies included a total of 883 outpatients with mild to moderate, primarily nonmelancholic, nonpsychotic major depressive disorder. Treatment duration ranged from 10 to 34 weeks (median=16 weeks). An intent-to-treat analysis indicated that, according to measurements by independent blind raters, antidepressant medication (tricyclic antidepressants and phenelzine) and psychotherapy (primarily cognitive behavior and interpersonal therapies) were more efficacious than control conditions, but there were no differences between active treatments. The percentages of remission for all patients randomly assigned to medication, psychotherapy, and control conditions were 46.4%, 46.3%, and 24.4%, respectively. Furthermore, significantly more patients dropped out of control conditions (54.4%) than either treatment with medication (37.1%) or psychotherapy (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Both antidepressant medication and psychotherapy may be considered first-line treatments for mildly to moderately depressed outpatients.</ab>

        <ab>This article is based on the authors' experience in designing and implementing outcomes management systems for large managed care organizations. Topics addressed include design of instruments, use of cost-effective technology, development of computerized decision-support tools, and methods for case-mix adjustment. The case-mix-adjustment models are based on a data repository of several thousand treatment cases with multiple measurement points across the course of treatment. Data from controlled and field studies are described. These data suggest that the outcomes management methods outlined in this article can result in significantly improved clinical outcomes and a more rational allocation of behavioral health care resources.</ab>

        <ab>Psychiatric rehabilitation by its very nature is multidisciplinary because of the many competencies required for its implementation. In promoting optimal levels of recovery from schizophrenia and other disabling mental disorders, teams must combine the expert contributions of professionals and paraprofessionals who can individualize a comprehensive array of evidence-based services with competency, consistency, continuity, coordination, collaboration, and fidelity. The authors describe the properties and functions of the multidisciplinary team and key attributes of effective teams. The importance of teams' involving clients, their relatives, and other supporters in setting personally relevant life goals is emphasized. The authors provide examples of the challenges posed by the need to individualize services and of the ways in which barriers to communication and coordination can be overcome. The roles of the various team members are described, including leadership roles and the unique role of the psychiatrist, in the context of newly emerging, evidence-based treatments for psychiatric rehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>OBJECTIVE: The author sought to illustrate the invalidity of meta-analyses that claim to quantitatively compare the benefits of psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy in patients with psychiatric disorders. METHOD: Studies included in four meta-analyses were retrieved and their study designs evaluated. RESULTS: The meta-analyses compared effect sizes from disparate studies that were not uniformly blind, random, controlled, or of high quality. The studies did not directly address the comparative efficacy question or lacked assay sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous types of studies exemplify the need for caution in evaluating meta-analytic conclusions without first critically examining the included studies. Estimates of the relative efficacy of different treatments are not well founded when based almost exclusively on indirect, multiply confounded comparisons. Meta-analyses based on flawed studies or studies that lack demonstrated assay sensitivity are also inadequate for the criticism of treatment guidelines. Some bodies of data are inadequate to support a proper meta-analysis.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety disorders often go unrecognized in distressed primary care patients, despite the overtly psychosocial nature of their demand for help. This is especially problematic in more severe disorders needing specific treatment (e.g. antidepressant pharmacotherapy or specialized cognitive behavioural therapy). The use of a screening tool to detect (more severe) depressive and anxiety disorders may be useful not to overlook such disorders. We examined the accuracy with which the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are able to detect (more severe) depressive and anxiety disorders in distressed patients, and which cut-off points should be used. METHODS: Seventy general practitioners (GPs) included 295 patients on sick leave due to psychological problems. They excluded patients with recognized depressive or anxiety disorders. Patients completed the 4DSQ and HADS. Standardized diagnoses of DSM-IV defined depressive and anxiety disorders were established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to obtain sensitivity and specificity values for a range of scores, and area under the curve (AUC) values as a measure of diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: With respect to the detection of any depressive or anxiety disorder (180 patients, 61%), the 4DSQ and HADS scales yielded comparable results with AUC values between 0.745 and 0.815. Also with respect to the detection of moderate or severe depressive disorder, the 4DSQ and HADS depression scales performed comparably (AUC 0.780 and 0.739, p 0.165). With respect to the detection of panic disorder, agoraphobia and social phobia, the 4DSQ anxiety scale performed significantly better than the HADS anxiety scale (AUC 0.852 versus 0.757, p 0.001). The recommended cut-off points of both HADS scales appeared to be too low while those of the 4DSQ anxiety scale appeared to be too high. CONCLUSION: In general practice patients on sick leave because of psychological problems, the 4DSQ and the HADS are equally able to detect depressive and anxiety disorders. However, for the detection of cases severe enough to warrant specific treatment, the 4DSQ may have some advantages over the HADS, specifically for the detection of panic disorder, agoraphobia and social phobia.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Comorbid psychopathology is an important predictor of poor outcome for many types of treatments for back or neck pain. But it is unknown if this applies to the results of medial branch blocks (MBBs) for chronic low back or neck pain, which involves injecting the medial branch of the dorsal ramus nerves that innervate the facet joints. The objective of this study was to determine whether high levels of psychopathology are predictive of pain relief after MBB injections in the lumbar or cervical spine.Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Consecutive patients in a pain medicine practice undergoing MBBs of the lumbar or cervical facets with corticosteroids were recruited to participate. Subjects were selected for a MBB based on operationalized selection criteria and the procedure was performed in a standardized manner. Subjects completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) just prior to the procedure and at one-month follow up. Scores on the HADS classified the subjects into three groups based on psychiatric symptoms, which formed the primary predictor variable: Low, Moderate, or High levels of psychopathology. The primary outcome measure was the percent improvement in average daily pain rating one-month following an injection. Analysis of variance and chi-square were used to analyze the analgesia and functional rating differences between groups, and to perform a responder analysis.Results: Eighty six (86) subjects completed the study. The Low psychopathology group (n = 37) reported a mean of 23% improvement in pain at one-month while the High psychopathology group (n = 29) reported a mean worsening of -5.8% in pain (p &lt; .001). Forty five percent (45%) of the Low group had at least 30% improvement in pain versus 10% in the High group (p &lt; .001). Using an analysis of covariance, no baseline demographic, social, or medical variables were significant predictors of pain improvement, nor did they mitigate the effect of psychopathology on the outcome.Conclusion: Psychiatric comorbidity is associated with diminished pain relief after a MBB injection performed with steroid at one-month follow-up. These findings illustrate the importance of assessing comorbid psychopathology as part of a spine care evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>What is the effect of guideline concordant care (ie antidepressant medication or cognitive behavioural therapy) compared with community care for depression in low income minority women?METHODS Design: Randomised controlled trial.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Single blind (outcome assessors blinded).Follow up period: Six months.Setting: Four suburban county health and welfare services, Washington, DC, USA; March 1997 to May 2002.Patients: 267 low income women (117 black and 16 white women born in the USA 134 Latina women born in Latin America) diagnosed with major depressive disorder using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Exclusions: bereavement, substance abuse, pregnancy or planning pregnancy in next 6 months, breast feeding, and current mental health care.Intervention: Antidepressant medication for 6 months (paroxetine 10-50 mg per day, or buproprion for participants not tolerating paroxetine or not improving after 9 weeks of paroxetine); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for 8 weeks (weekly group or individual sessions; followed by 8 further sessions for non-improvers; participant and therapist manuals adapted from a programme specifically for low income English and Spanish speakers), or referral to community care (information about depression and mental health treatments available in the community, offer of referral to mental health care physician). Participants were assessed at baseline and monthly follow up by telephone interview.Outcomes: Improvement in depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score); improved instrumental role functioning (Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) interview); and improvement in social functioning (Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36)).Patient follow up: Community care: 9% attended &gt;/=4 sessions; antidepressants: 75% received antidepressants for &gt;/=9 weeks and 40% received antidepressants for &gt;/=24 weeks; cognitive behaviour therapy: 53% received &gt;/=4 sessions and 36% received &gt;/=6 sessions.MAIN RESULTS:About 75% of women offered community care referral accepted; only 17% received any mental health treatment. Antidepressants and CBT significantly improved depressive symptoms at 6 months compared with community care (adjusted mean HDRS score: 5.2 with antidepressant v 7.2 with CBT v 10.1 with community referral; antidepressant v community referral p&lt;0.001; CBT v community referral p=0.006). Only antidepressant treatment significantly increased instrumental role functioning at 6 months compared with community care (adjusted mean SAS score: 1.7 with antidepressant v 2.2 with CBT v 2.3 with community referral; antidepressant v community referral p = 0.006; CBT v community referral p = 0.58). Both antidepressant and CBT significantly increased social functioning compared with community referral (adjusted mean SP-36 score: 88.0 with antidepressant v 83.7 with CBT v 74.5 with community referral; antidepressant v community referral p = 0.001; CBT v community referral p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS:Guideline based antidepressant treatment or CBT are more effective than community care in treating depression in low income minority women.Authors note that both antidepressant and CBT interventions involved considerable additional support that was not provided to community care referred women. This support included outreach, childcare, transportation to care, and encouragement to comply with treatment. Therefore, the effect of guideline based care alone cannot be gauged by this study.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The broad aim of this study was to assess the contribution of job strain to mental health inequalities by (a) estimating the proportion of depression attributable to job strain (low control and high demand jobs), (b) assessing variation in attributable risk by occupational skill level, and (c) comparing numbers of job strain-attributable depression cases to numbers of compensated 'mental stress' claims. Methods: Standard population attributable risk (PAR) methods were used to estimate the proportion of depression attributable to job strain. An adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.82 for job strain in relation to depression was obtained from a recently published meta-analysis and combined with exposure prevalence data from the Australian state of Victoria. Job strain exposure prevalence was determined from a 2003 population-based telephone survey of working Victorians (n = 1101, 66% response rate) using validated measures of job control (9 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.80) and psychological demands (3 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.66). Estimates of absolute numbers of prevalent cases of depression and successful stress-related workers' compensation claims were obtained from publicly available Australian government sources. Results: Overall job strain-population attributable risk (PAR) for depression was 13.2% for males [95% CI 1.1, 28.1] and 17.2% [95% CI 1.5, 34.9] for females. There was a clear gradient of increasing PAR with decreasing occupational skill level. Estimation of job strain-attributable cases (21,437) versus "mental stress" compensation claims (696) suggest that claims statistics underestimate job strain-attributable depression by roughly 30-fold. Conclusion: Job strain and associated depression risks represent a substantial, preventable, and inequitably distributed public health problem. The social patterning of job strain-attributable depression parallels the social patterning of mental illness, suggesting that job strain is an important contributor to mental health inequalities. The numbers of compensated 'mental stress' claims compared to job strain-attributable depression cases suggest that there is substantial under-recognition and under-compensation of job strain-attributable depression. Primary, secondary, and tertiary intervention efforts should be substantially expanded, with intervention priorities based on hazard and associated health outcome data as an essential complement to claims statistics.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the effect of incontinence surgery and pelvic floor training on quality of life (QOL), anxiety and depression in patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Methods: In a prospective longitudinal study, females with proven SUI were asked to complete a set of standardized questionnaires (sociodemographic data sheet, FACT-G, I-QOL, HADS) before and eight weeks after treatment. The comparison groups consisted of a surgical treatment group and a conservative group that underwent supervised pelvic floor training for eight weeks. Results: From the 67 female patients included in the study a number of 53 patients completed both assessment time points (mean age 57.4, mean years of SUI 7.6). The surgical treatment group consisted of 32 patients of which 21 patients received a modified Burch colposuspension and 11 patients a tension-free mid-urethral tape suspension. The 21 patients in the conservative group attended eight once-weekly supervised pelvic floor training sessions. After treatment the surgical intervention group showed a significantly higher improvement of QOL (FACT-G and I-QOL) and anxiety (HADS) than the pelvic floor training group. Conclusion: For female patients with SUI surgery yielded a better outcome than pelvic floor training with regard to quality of life and anxiety.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This paper presents a case study that demonstrates the evolution of a project entitled "Enhancing QUality-of-care In Psychosis" (EQUIP) that began approximately when the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), and implementation science were emerging. EQUIP developed methods and tools to implement chronic illness care principles in the treatment of schizophrenia, and evaluated this implementation using a small-scale controlled trial. The next iteration of the project, EQUIP-2, was further informed by implementation science and the use of QUERI tools.Methods: This paper reports the background, development, results and implications of EQUIP, and also describes ongoing work in the second phase of the project (EQUIP-2). The EQUIP intervention uses implementation strategies and tools to increase the adoption and implementation of chronic illness care principles. In EQUIP-2, these strategies and tools are conceptually grounded in a stages-of-change model, and include clinical and delivery system interventions and adoption/implementation tools. Formative evaluation occurs in conjunction with the intervention, and includes developmental, progress-focused, implementation-focused, and interpretive evaluation.Results: Evaluation of EQUIP provided an understanding of quality gaps and how to address related problems in schizophrenia. EQUIP showed that solutions to quality problems in schizophrenia differ by treatment domain and are exacerbated by a lack of awareness of evidence-based practices. EQUIP also showed that improving care requires creating resources for physicians to help them easily implement practice changes, plus intensive education as well as product champions who help physicians use these resources. Organizational changes, such as the addition of care managers and informatics systems, were shown to help physicians with identifying problems, making referrals, and monitoring follow-up. In EQUIP-2, which is currently in progress, these initial findings were used to develop a more comprehensive approach to implementing and evaluating the chronic illness care model.Discussion: In QUERI, small-scale projects contribute to the development and enhancement of hands-on, action-oriented service-directed projects that are grounded in current implementation science. This project supports the concept that QUERI tools can be useful in implementing complex care models oriented toward evidence-based improvement of clinical care.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The community's knowledge and beliefs about mental health problems, their risk factors, treatments and sources of help may vary as a function of age. Methods: Data were taken from an epidemiological survey conducted during 2003-2004 with a national clustered sample of Australian adults aged 18 years and over. Following the presentation of a vignette describing depression (n = 1001) or schizophrenia (n = 997), respondents were asked a series of questions relating to their knowledge and recognition of the disorder, beliefs about the helpfulness of treating professionals and medical, psychological and lifestyle treatments, and likely causes. Results: Participant age was coded into five categories and cross-tabulated with mental health literacy variables. Comparisons between age groups revealed that although older adults (70+ years) were poorer than younger age groups at correctly recognising depression and schizophrenia, young adults (18-24 years) were more likely to misidentify schizophrenia as depression. Differences were also observed between younger and older age groups in terms of beliefs about the helpfulness of certain treating professionals and medical and lifestyle treatments for depression and schizophrenia, and older respondents were more likely to believe that schizophrenia could be caused by character weakness. Conclusion: Differences in mental health literacy across the adult lifespan suggest that more specific, age appropriate messages about mental health are required for younger and older age groups. The tendency for young adults to 'over-identify' depression signals the need for awareness campaigns to focus on differentiation between mental disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Background: This study investigated the costs and outcomes of implementing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in a mental health center (MHC). CBT is an evidence-based treatment for CFS that was scarcely available until now. To investigate the possibilities for wider implementation, a pilot implementation project was set up. Method: Costs and effects were evaluated in a non-controlled before- and after study with an eight months time-horizon. Both the costs of performing the treatments and the costs of implementing the treatment program were included in the analysis. The implementation interventions included: informing general practitioners (GPs) and CFS patients, training therapists, and instructing the MHC employees. Given the non-controlled design, cost outcome ratios (CORs) and their acceptability curves were analyzed. Analyses were done from a health care perspective and from a societal perspective. Bootstrap analyses were performed to estimate the uncertainty around the cost and outcome results. Results: 125 CFS patients were included in the study. After treatment 37% had recovered from CFS and the mean gained QALY was 0.03. Costs of patients' health care and productivity losses had decreased significantly. From the societal perspective the implementation led to cost savings and to higher health states for patients, indicating dominancy. From the health care perspective the implementation revealed overall costs of €5.320 per recovered patient, with an acceptability curve showing a 100% probability for a positive COR at a willingness to pay threshold of €6.500 per recovered patient. Conclusion: Implementing CBT for CFS in a MHC appeared to have a favorable cost outcome ratio (COR) from a societal perspective. From a health care perspective the COR depended on how much a recovered CFS patient is being valued. The strength of the evidence was limited by the non-controlled design. The outcomes of this study might facilitate health care providers when confronted with the decision whether or not to adopt CBT for CFS in their institution.</ab>

        <ab>QUESTION: Do non-drinkers and hazardous/harmful drinkers have increased symptoms of depression and anxiety during young adulthood?DesignCross sectional analysis of population-based cohort study.SettingCanberra region, Australia; March 1999 to February 2000.ParticipantsRandom sample of 2404 people aged between 20 and 24 years participating in the 'Path Through Life' project, an ongoing study with interviews every 4 years for 20 years. Complete data were available for 95% (2276).Assessment of risk factorsThe Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scales, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test were completed using hand-held computers.Main outcome measuresAlcohol consumption; anxiety; depression; positive and negative affect.Main resultsFor men, both hazardous/harmful and non/occasional drinkers reported higher symptom scores and lower positive affect than light drinkers. The mental health of non-drinkers could not be explained by a history of hazardous/harmful drinking or current tobacco or cannabis use. Higher levels of distress were accounted for by poorer physical health and lower extraversion. For women, hazardous/harmful drinkers had higher levels of depression and negative affect. Recent stressful events and cannabis and tobacco consumption were important for understanding levels of distress among male and female hazardous/harmful drinkers.ConclusionsHeavy drinkers and male non-drinkers reported increased distress, but had little else in common. These findings contradict hypotheses that account for nondrinkers' distress with past problem drinking, other substance use or characteristics common to heavy drinkers.</ab>

        <ab>How do mental health problems and treatment of these problems affect working life?METHODSDESIGNQualitative study using focus groups.SETTINGLeicestershire, UK.PATIENTS12 focus groups. 9 groups of patients who had anxiety and/or depression in the previous 2 years and used medication (6 groups: 35 patients [28-60 y, 63% women] from various work sectors; 3 groups: 19 patients [18-63 y, 74% women] attending anxiety management courses). 3 groups of 20 staff who had responsibility for human resources, personnel, and occupational health and safety (age not reported, 65% women).METHODSEach focus group session (approximately 90 min) was audiotaped and transcribed. Transcripts were analysed by sorting verbatim material into emergent themes using Knodel's method. An expert panel reviewed the findings to discuss implications for practice.MAIN FINDINGSImpact on working life. Participants shared how their families, friends, or colleagues often recognised their depression or anxiety symptoms first. Typically, participants were unaware until a crisis occurred. Symptoms included nausea, headache, dizziness, trembling, lack of energy, tiredness, lack of concentration, extremes of emotion, and lack of motivation. Sleep patterns were disturbed, which perpetuated the feeling of tiredness. Most respondents felt that their work performance was impaired: they were indecisive, unable to concentrate, and unproductive. Effects of prescribed medication. Drug side effects were similar to anxiety and depression symptoms (ie, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and difficulties with decision making). Participants described feeling distant and dislocated. Sometimes anxiety symptoms were exacerbated by the medication. Non-compliance with medication. Participants often took less than the prescribed amount or discontinued use altogether because their symptoms initially worsened or did not improve. Some experienced symptoms when they forgot to take their drugs or stopped treatment, which made them fear addiction or dependence. Participants who found the medication helpful worried about psychological dependency. Generally, participants did not like taking medication and would often stop once their symptoms began to improve. Patient information. Some participants found their GPs helpful. Many, however, found that they were not given enough information about side effects. The leaflets accompanying medications were frightening and unhelpful. Participants also had differing ideas about how long the medication needed to take effect and the importance of taking medication every day. Participants admitted to hospital found that hospital staff could take the time to explain fully what to expect from medication. Self help groups were also good sources of information. The expert panel felt that GPs needed to 'sell' the benefits of medication and explain how patients might feel heightened anxiety initially. Patient monitoring. The expert panel felt that compliance was not as great a problem with more recent drugs. They also thought that lack of compliance was most problematic in the early stages of treatment, when patients may feel worse, and later on when they start to feel better. Most participants reported that their drug prescriptions were reviewed on a regular basis. Participants valued consistency in treatment. Sometimes they felt that GPs were not familiar with the medication or range of services. When referred to see a specialist, they felt that treatment options and possible causes of their illness were more fully discussed. Access to services varied among participants.CONCLUSIONSPatients with anxiety and depression felt that their work performance was impaired by their symptoms and drug side effects. They felt ill informed and needed more information to help them know what to expect so that they did not discontinue drugs prematurely.</ab>

        <ab>Does treating depression and low perceived social support (LPSS) with cognitive behaviour therapy and, where indicated, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) within 28 days of myocardial infarction (MI) reduce risk of subsequent MI and death?METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial.Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Open for clinicians and patients; outcome assessors and data analysts blinded. Follow up period: 29 months (mean).Setting: 73 hospitals associated with 8 clinical centres in the USA; recruitment October 1996 to October 1999, study completed April 2001.Patients: 2481 people (1084 female, 1397 male) with MI in the previous 28 days, diagnosed with major or minor depression or dysthymia (ENRICHD modified DSM-IV criteria: symptoms present ,14 days or &gt;/=7 days provided at least 1 prior episode of major depression) or LPSS (ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (ESSI)), or both. Exclusions: MI following a coronary intervention; receiving psychotherapy for depression; major comorbidity; participation in another research protocol. Ongoing treatment with antidepressants was a criterion for exclusion before April 1998 but was altered at that time to allow inclusion of people on antidepressants for &gt;/=14 days whose depression had not improved.Intervention: The treatment group received CBT for depression. For participants with LPSS, CBT was supplemented with techniques adapted from social learning theory and other psychotherapeutic support trials. Group sessions were initiated after at least 3 individual sessions. Treatment group participants who, after 5 weeks, showed a poor response (reduction of &lt;50% in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores &gt;24) were considered for pharmacotherapy. Participants were initiated on sertraline (50 mg/d to 200 mg/d) and if necessary changed to another SSRI or nortriptyline. Behavioural intervention continued for &lt;/= 6 months, group therapy for an additional 12 weeks, and pharmacotherapy for 12 months. The control group received usual care.Outcomes: Non-fatal recurrent MI and all-cause death. Change in BDI and ESSI scores at 6 months were secondary outcomes.Patient follow up: 93%.MAIN RESULTSAt 29 months, there was no significant difference between the treatment and usual care groups for the primary outcome (recurrent MI or death: 24% v 24%; hazard ratio 1.01; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.18). At 6 months, (see table) the treatment intervention improved psychosocial outcomes compared with usual care (p&lt;0.001). These differences were not maintained at 30 months for BDI or at 42 months for ESSI scores.CONCLUSION:Although the intervention may improve depression and LPSS after MI in the short term, it does not decrease the risk of recurrent MI and death.</ab>

Adults with organic disorders were excluded.Risk factors: Participants were interviewed to obtain information on: age, education level, socioeconomic status, marital status, social support, professional support, history of treatment for depression or generalised anxiety, or both, and presence of chronic disease (Cambridge Examination of Mental Disorders of the Elderly questions), cognitive status (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)), abilities in activities of daily living (ADL and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales).Outcomes: GMS-AGECAT diagnosis of pure depression (depression case level &gt;/=3), pure generalised anxiety (generalised anxiety case level &gt;/=3), or mixed anxiety/depression (both depression and generalised anxiety case levels &gt;/=3).MAIN RESULTSThe prevalence of generalised anxiety was higher among people with depression (14.5%) than in people without depression (1.3%; p value not given); the same was true for the prevalence of depression in people with generalised anxiety (60.4% in people with anxiety v 10.8% in those without; p&lt;0.0001). The likelihood of comorbidity significantly increased with increasing severity of both depression and generalised anxiety (p&lt;0.0001). Women showed significantly higher comorbidity then men (OR for mixed anxiety/depression 5.53, 95% CI 2.36 to 13.00). Risk profiles for pure and mixed diagnoses were similar (see table).CONCLUSIONSDepression and generalised anxiety show a high incidence of comorbidity, increasing in parallel to disease severity. Risk factors for the diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or mixed diagnosis were similar. Mixed anxiety/depression is much more frequent in women than in men.</ab>

        <ab>QUESTION: How cost effective is cognitive therapy for preventing relapse in depression?DesignRandomised controlled trial with allocation concealment. Outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation. The reviewers audited blinding status and assessed inter-rater reliability.SettingUnited Kingdom; timeframe not specified.Participants158 people aged 21-65 years with partially remitted major depression, despite treatment. All participants had an episode of unipolar major depression satisfying DSM-III-R criteria within the past 18 months, but not in the past 2 months. At randomisation all participants had residual symptoms of at least 8 weeks duration, with a score of 8 or greater on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and 9 or greater on the Beck Depression Inventory. Mean age 43 years; 49% women. People with a history of bipolar disorder or significant Axis I or Axis II comorbidity were excluded, as were those receiving formal psychotherapy and those who had received more than 5 sessions of cognitive therapy in the past.InterventionParticipants received clinical management and antidepressants with or without cognitive therapy. The minimum dose of antidepressants was equivalent to 125 mg of amitryptiline. Clinical management comprised 30 minute appointments with a psychiatrist every 4 weeks for 20 weeks and every 8 weeks during 48-week follow up. Cognitive therapy comprised 16 sessions over 20 weeks, with two booster sessions.Main outcome measuresThe major outcomes were relapse rates and healthcare resource use measured prospectively over a 17 month period. The economic analysis comprised direct costs to the National Health Service. Indirect costs and nonhealth service expenditure were not considered.Main resultsIn people receiving cognitive therapy, cumulative relapse rates were significantly lower than controls (29% v 47%). The overall mean cost of cognitive therapy wasPounds 1164 per person (95% CI Pounds 1084 to Pounds 1244, see table). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio ranged from Pounds 4328 to Pounds 5027 per additional relapse prevented.ConclusionsIn people with medication-resistant depression, adding cognitive therapy to standard treatment is more costly, but more effective, than antidepressants and clinical management alone. The cost of providing cognitive therapy is about Pounds 12.50 per additional relapse-free day.</ab>

        <ab>QUESTION: How do anti-depressants and psychotherapy compare in generating full remission in major depressive disorder?Design:Systematic review with meta-analysis.Data sources:Studies were identified using Medline and PsychInfo (to November 2000).Study selection:Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials with blinded participants and assessors that (1) directly compared medications, psychotherapy and controls for well defined major depressive disorder; (2) included remission data. 6 studies were included with 883 outpatients with mild to moderate non-psychotic major depressive disorder. Mean age ranged from 32-40 years; 77% women (range 68-85%). Median treatment duration was 16 weeks (range 10-34).Data extraction:Data were extracted on baseline measurements, sample size, duration of treatment, remission, follow up and dropout rates. The main outcome was full remission.Main results:Tricyclic antidepressants, phenelzine and psychotherapy (primarily cognitive behaviour and interpersonal therapies) were more effective at promoting remission than control conditions. There was no difference in remission between antidepressants and psychotherapy regimens (table).Conclusions:Antidepressants and psychotherapy may both be effective first-line treatments for outpatients with mild to moderate depression.</ab>

        <ab>QUESTION: Is cognitive therapy more effective than other psychological treatments for depression?DesignReanalysis of meta-analysis conducted in 1998.Data sourcesThe authors do not describe the data sources used in the original meta-analysis (the search strategy is outlined in a previous article).Study selectionEligible studies were randomised trials comparing cognitive therapy with another psychological treatment for people with a major depressive or dysthymic disorder. People with psychotic or bipolar disorders were excluded. 22 studies were included in the original meta-analysis, 10 of which used a 'bona fide' comparison group. Treatments were defined as 'bona fide' if the therapist was trained to provide therapy, held at least a masters degree or was enrolled in a relevant graduate programme; face to face meetings were used to develop a relationship; treatment was individualised for the participant rather than involving a rigid standard protocol, and therapy included psychologically valid components.Data extractionData were extracted on population, sample size, treatment characteristics and effect size. Larger studies were more heavily weighted when calculating aggregate effect sizes. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory in all studies.Main resultsCognitive therapy and 'other therapies' were equally effective for reducing depression scores. The aggregate effect size of cognitive therapy was 0.49 over non bona fide therapies (95% CI 0.28 to 0.69); 0.16 over bona fide therapies (95% CI -0.01 to 0.32), and 0.03 over bona fide therapies once a statistical outlier was removed (95% CI -0.15 to 0.2).ConclusionsPrevious meta-analyses suggested that cognitive therapy is more effective than other therapies for depression (excluding behaviour therapy). After accounting for 'control' treatments, this reanalysis found no evidence that cognitive therapy was more effective than other psychological therapies. The authors conclude that bona fide psychological treatments for depression are equally effective.</ab>

        <ab>QUESTION: In adolescents with depressive symptoms and who have depressed parents, does a group cognitive intervention prevent or delay the onset of the subsequent development of a full depressive episode?DesignRandomised (allocation concealed*}**, blinded (data collectors, data analysts, and study investigators}[**]*, controlled trial with 24 months of follow up (median 14 months of follow up).SettingHealth maintenance organization (HMO) in Portland, Oregon, USA.Patients94 adolescents (mean age 15 y, 60% girls) with both subsyndromal depression and a parent with either a current episode of major depression or dysthymia, or an episode in the previous 12 months. 83% were followed for up to 24 months.Intervention45 adolescents were allocated to usual HMO care plus a 15 session group cognitive therapy prevention programme and 49 were allocated to usual HMO care only. In the group cognitive therapy prevention programme adolescents were taught cognitive restructuring techniques. Each session lasted 1 hour.Main outcome measuresScores on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCI.), the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale (CES-D), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E), and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF); and risk of incident major depressive episodes.Main resultsTreatment programme by time effects favouring the cognitive therapy group were shown for the CES-D (p=0.005), the HAM-D (p=0.05), the K-SADS-E (p=0.04), and the GAF (p=0.04) but not the CBCL (p=0.62). The statistically significant group differences were evident from baseline to after treatment and after treatment to 1 year follow up, but not to 2 years follow up. After adjustment for sex, age, CES-D score, and depression history, the cumulative risk of incident major depressive episodes at 12 months follow up was lower in the cognitive therapy group than in the usual care group (table). This difference was no longer statistically significant (p=0.07) at 24 months.ConclusionIn adolescent offspring of depressed parents, a group cognitive therapy programme reduced depressive symptoms and the cumulative risk of depressive episodes at 12 months follow up.*See glossary.**Information provided by author.</ab>
