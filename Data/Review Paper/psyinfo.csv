"Journal Article","Intercultural dimensions in the treatment of traumatized refugee families.","This article conceptualizes problems of traumatized refugee families and describes therapeutic work that seeks to transcend dilemmas and tensions arising within the discourses on culture, trauma, and treatment. Several options for treatment that help avoid the usual traps and pitfalls in trauma treatment of culturally diverse populations are presented and discussed. These options include the use of multifocal conceptual lenses, the creation of possibilities for various interpretations within a flexible therapeutic setting, intercultural negotiations, and the invocation of culturally relevant resources.

"Journal Article","The incorporation of literature into clinical practice.","In this article, the importance of flexibility in clinical practice is discussed, and the incorporation of literature is taken as an example of such flexibility. Literature might for example provide opportunities for reflecting on emotions, relationships, and possible future selves. We present the work of 2 clinicians who used literature in their clinical practice, an approach that in these cases became fundamental for successful treatment. In the first case, the client introduced literature as an important topic and the clinician responded to the client’s need to discuss literature. In the second case, the clinician reflected on literature she had read herself. She thus understood the client and could establish a genuine therapeutic dialogue. Both cases show how flexible incorporation of literature and other modes of artistic expression can provide an opening space for therapeutic dialogue, and opportunities for reflection. Clinical practice is however currently focused on diagnoses and structured interventions. Therefore, the possibility to approach clients in a flexible manner needs to be acknowledged and supported.

"Letter","Chronic pain and the adaptive significance of positive emotions.","The February–March 2014 special issue of the American Psychologist featured articles summarizing select contributions from the field of psychology to the assessment and treatment of chronic pain. The articles examined a range of psychosocial and family factors that influence individual adjustment and contribute to disparities in pain care. The reviews also considered the psychological correlates and neurophysiological mechanisms of specific pain treatments, including cognitive–behavioral therapy, hypnosis, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness, and meditation. Although a number of articles emphasized the role that negative states of mind play in pain outcomes, positive emotions were given only brief mention. Here, we provide a rationale for the inclusion of positive emotions in chronic pain research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Ong, Anthony D.;Zautra, Alex J.;Reid, M.

"Journal Article","Positive social psychology: A multilevel inquiry into sociocultural well-being initiatives.","Although the field of positive psychology has made great strides in developing interventions for well-being, many of these are aimed at individuals, designed to engender adaptive psychological qualities and skills. As such, relatively little attention has been paid within the field to the sociocultural factors that influence health and well-being. However, there is an emergent body of work that does focus on these factors, as summarized in this paper. Using Bronfenbrenner’s (1977) multilevel ecological systems theory as a framework, the paper provides an overview of sociocultural well-being interventions and research at multiple levels of scale (microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, macrosystems, and ecosystems). In doing so, the paper has 2 main aims: (a) to show how positive change in well-being can be affected by the strategic manipulation of sociocultural contextual factors; and (b) to suggest ways in which the adoption of such a contextual approach can inform policy making.

"Journal Article","Psychological and relational health profiles of soldiers in committed romantic relationships.","The present study explored the heterogeneity of military service members’ psychological and relational functioning using a sample of 7,866 soldiers in committed romantic relationships from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members (Army STARRS). A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify and predict unique clusters of soldiers’ relative psychological (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety symptom severity) and relational (i.e., relationship happiness, how often their relationship was going well, how often they confided in their partner, how often they considered or discussed ending their relationship, relational insecurity, and relational turbulence) functioning. Results revealed 4 distinct classes of comparative psychological and relational health: hardy soldiers and healthy relaters (70.2%), stressed soldiers but healthy relaters (13.1%), hardy soldiers but strained relaters (12.7%), and stressed soldiers and strained relaters (4.0%). Class descriptions, as well as implications for theory and clinical practice are reviewed. Notably, 7 out of 10 soldiers in this nationally representative sample reported little to no psychological or relational distress. These findings invite more adaptive narratives of service member resilience and a more nuanced conceptualization of gradations in psychological and relational functioning.

"Journal Article","Universal design for learning.","The concept of universal design (UD) emerged from architectural design of buildings that offer access for all who enter them. An innovation that was promulgated following state and federal legislation, UD is now required in all public buildings to make them fully accessible to the widest spectrum of users, including people with disabilities. The UDL framework provides guidance for creating flexible curricula and instructional environments, and for using technology to maximize success for all students, including those with physical and/or psychiatric disabilities. The UDL perspective embraces the idea of instructor creativity in developing teaching strategies and assessment techniques that are effective for all learners, while still maintaining the integrity of the course and achieving its objectives. UDL creates a learning culture in which diversity is accepted and embraced, and where all students are encouraged to learn and demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of ways.

"Journal Article","Client factors that predict the therapeutic alliance in a chronic, complex trauma sample.","This investigation aimed to examine how specific client characteristics of individuals with chronic, complex trauma are associated with the type of coping strategies that they use and the quality of the therapeutic alliance. Fifty-nine adult participants with diagnostic levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and who attended therapy for complex trauma in Northern Ireland were obtained via opportunity sampling. Participants completed self-report measures of client attachment style, alexithymia, coping strategies, and the therapeutic alliance. Preoccupied attachment factors such as Need for Approval and Preoccupation with Relationships were related to use of maladaptive coping strategies. In contrast, the adaptive coping strategies of Acceptance and Instrumental Support were significant predictors of a positive therapeutic alliance whereas established psychological and traumatogenic factors (e.g., attachment, number of traumatic events) did not significantly predict the therapeutic alliance. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between client characteristics and the therapeutic alliance within complex trauma populations as well as developing protocols to assist this process.

"Journal Article","Quality of life for youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury.","The primary aim of this study was to characterize parent- and youth-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for youth experiencing persistent symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The youth in the current study were participating in a longitudinal project examining neuropsychological consultation as an intervention for persistent symptoms after mTBI. Participants included 71 youth aged 8 to17 years old who had sustained mild head injuries 2 to 12 months prior to enrollment and who were referred clinically to an outpatient pediatric concussion program because of concerns about persistent problems. Parents and children completed the PedsQL over the phone at the time of enrollment. Child- and parent-reported HRQOL was significantly worse than for other pediatric populations with a variety of chronic health conditions. HRQOL was not associated with injury-related factors. One important novel finding was that families involved in litigation reported significantly lower HRQOL than families not involved in litigation. Providers would benefit from screening for involvement in litigation early on. Children who experience persistent symptomatology and impaired functioning following mTBI are likely to benefit most from early intervention and reassurance de-emphasizing injury-related factors and focusing on cognitive–behavioral treatment aimed at improving adaptive coping, pain management, and stress reduction.

"Journal Article","The power of the mand: Utilizing the mand repertoire to decrease problem behavior.","The acquisition of a competent manding repertoire can present a challenge for a typically developing child with verbal behavior; it can be even more cumbersome for a child with autism who is effectively vocally nonverbal. Minshawi et al. (2014) recognized that the side effects of language delays, such as self-injurious behavior (SIB), must also be addressed because of the high correlation between SIB and a limited vocal verbal repertoire. The present study examined the relationship between SIB and a manding repertoire with 2 methods of communication. The participant of the present study was a 12-year-old boy who received direct, 1-on-1 Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy, emphasizing the development of the verbal repertoire. The study focused on 2 goals: establishing an effective manding repertoire while decreasing SIB. The subject began the study using PECS as his primary communication system, adaptive sign language was introduced as a secondary method of communication. The results suggest a correlation between an increased verbal repertoire and the decrease of SIB.

"Journal Article","State of the art procedures for Assessment and treatment of learners with behavioral problems.","Challenging behavior can create significant obstacles to academic and social progress for individuals in a school setting, particularly those with developmental disabilities. Functional assessments such as rating scales, ABC analyses, and functional analyses, are evidenced to be the most effective methods for identifying the maintaining variables of problem behavior and for informing efficient, function-based interventions. Although the empirical literature and federal mandates support the use of functional assessment, obstacles to the practical application of these procedures in school settings (e.g., training requirements, time constraints) may deter school staff from using them consistently. Recent research has addressed some of these concerns, and there is developing evidence for briefer, more user-friendly versions of functional assessment. Practitioners can maximize the effectiveness of the intervention process by linking treatment components to functional assessment results. Effective, function-based interventions are comprised of procedures designed to reduce target behavior prior to it occurrence, procedures to teach the learner to access the reinforcer (or an adaptive alternative) appropriately, and systematic procedures for responding to the behavior. Future studies should continue to refine these procedures and address the use of functional assessment with ext ended populations, including adults with disabilities and typically developing children.

"Journal Article","How cohabitation, marriage, separation, and divorce influence BMI: A prospective panel study.","Objective: This study examines how changes in cohabitation or marital status affect Body Mass Index (BMI) over time in a large representative sample. Method: Participants were 20,950 individuals (50% female; 19 to 100 years), representative of the German population, who provided 81,926 observations over 16 years. Face-to-face interviews were used to obtain demographic data, including cohabitation and marital status, height, body weight, and weight-relevant behaviors (exercise, healthy eating, and smoking). Control variables included age, notable changes in status (life events such as having children or change in employment status), perceived stress, and subjective health. Results: Cohabitation led to significant weight gain in men and women—after four years or longer, about twice the gain associated with marriage (controlling for weight-related behaviors, age, children, employment, stress, and health). BMI after separation was largely comparable to BMI before starting cohabitation; women lost some weight in the first year, men gained some weight after four or more years of separation. Divorce generally predicted weight gain. Changes in exercise, healthy eating, and smoking did not attenuate the effect of changes in relationship status on BMI. Conclusions: This is among the first longitudinal studies to directly compare the effects of key changes in relationship status on BMI. The findings extend and qualify previous results by showing that the benefits of marriage or cohabitation do not necessarily include a healthier BMI. They also suggest that relationship transitions—particularly moving in with a partner and divorce—may be important time windows for weight gain prevention.

"Journal Article","Health behavior models for informing digital technology interventions for individuals with mental illness.","Objective: Theoretical models offer valuable insights for designing effective and sustainable behavioral health interventions, yet the application of theory for informing digital technology interventions for people with mental illness has received limited attention. We offer a perspective on the importance of applying behavior theories and models to developing digital technology interventions for addressing mental and physical health concerns among people with mental illness. Method: In this commentary, we summarize prominent theories of human behavior, highlight key theoretical constructs, and identify opportunities to inform digital health interventions for people with mental illness. We consider limitations with existing theories and models, and examine recent theoretical advances that can specifically guide development of digital technology interventions. Results: Established behavioral frameworks including health belief model, theory of planned behavior, transtheoretical model, and social cognitive theory consist of important and overlapping constructs that can inform digital health interventions for people with mental illness. As digital technologies continue to evolve and enable longitudinal data collection, real-time behavior monitoring, and adaptive features tailored to users’ changing needs over time, there are new opportunities to broaden our understanding of health behaviors and mechanisms of behavior change. Recent advances include dynamic models of behavior, persuasive system design, the behavioral intervention technology model, and behavioral models for just-in-time adaptive interventions. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: Behavior theories offer advantages for guiding use of digital technologies. Future researchers must explore how theoretical models can effectively advance efforts to develop, evaluate, and disseminate digital health interventions targeting individuals with mental illness.

"Journal Article","Immediate and long-term efficacy of executive functions cognitive training in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","There has been growing interest in enhancing cognition in older adulthood via computerized cognitive training (CCT), though, there is controversy surrounding the efficacy of CCT in promoting improvements to functional everyday activities. As core executive-functions (EFs)—cognitive-flexibility, inhibition, working memory—are applicable to most aspects of daily living, CCT targeting these processes would likely promote gains on trained tasks, and potentially on similar untrained tasks (near-transfer), and general cognitive performance (far-transfer). We report two meta-analyses investigating the immediate (pretest to posttest) and long-term efficacy (pretest to follow-up) of core-EF CCT in improving cognition among older adults. Sixty-four studies (encompassing 3,594 participants) included an eligible CCT intervention targeting at least 1 core-EF (e.g., working memory training). Both immediate and long-term efficacy analyses revealed significant, large training effects for trained outcomes, and significant, small training effects for near-transfer and far-transfer outcomes. When comparing the same studies, effect sizes from immediate and long-term efficacy analyses were comparable, suggesting that CCT gains were maintained over time. Further analyses of immediate efficacy revealed significant, small training effects for performance on executive functioning, fluid intelligence, memory, and visuospatial domains, but not for attention or processing speed. After adjusting for publication bias, the training effect for fluid intelligence was nonsignificant, whereas processing speed was significant. It is recommended that future studies employ adaptive multidomain training as these studies were shown to produce significant training effects at each transfer level. Overall, core-EF CCT interventions show promise in promoting immediate and long-term improvements in cognitive performance among older adults.

"Journal Article","Rapid-response behavioral triage for tics (RRBTT): A 2-week clinical case series.","Traditional behavioral treatments for tic disorders in youth require 8 sessions delivered over 10 weeks. Treatment duration represents a major barrier for patients and families, hinders direct comparisons between behavioral treatment and front line medication, and may motivate front line pharmacotherapy in place of behavioral interventions. The current case series describes an accelerated rapid-response behavioral triage for tics (RRBTT) and treatment outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted on clinically referred patients (n = 10). The RRBTT consisted of 8 sessions delivered over 2 weeks, with a 1-month booster and evaluation session. Primary outcome measures were completed by the therapist conjointly with the parent and child at baseline, 1 and 2 weeks after beginning treatment, and 1 month after completing treatment. On average, youth experienced significant reductions (17.9%) in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale after 1 week of treatment and (40.8%) by the 2-week posttreatment assessment (effect size = .76). Posttreatment improvements in outcomes maintained at the 1-month follow-up with no additional treatment. Half of the patients (n = 5) were rated as treatment responders, with 4 additional patients rated as receiving some benefit. The current findings highlight the flexible administration of an accelerated behavioral treatment, suggesting that the RRBTT may be effective in treating children and adolescents with tic disorders. These preliminary findings suggest the need for large-scale randomized controlled trials of RRBTT.

Specifically, the current study examined conduct problem youths' mental set (or theory) regarding intelligence (entity vs. incremental) upon task performance. We assessed 36 juvenile offenders with psychopathic features and tested whether providing them with two different messages regarding intelligence would affect their functioning on a task related to academic performance. The study employed a MANOVA design with two motivational conditions and three outcomes including fluency, flexibility, and originality. Results showed that youth with psychopathic features who were given a message that intelligence grows over time, were more fluent and flexible than youth who were informed that intelligence is static. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of originality. The implications of these findings are discussed including the possible benefits of interventions for adolescent offenders with conduct problems and psychopathic features.

"Journal Article","Acculturative stress and coping strategies among Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong: A qualitative inquiry.","Despite the growing population of Mainland Chinese students at the local government-funded universities in Hong Kong, little is known about their acculturation experiences and psychosocial adjustment. Drawing on an acculturation framework (Berry, 2003) and theories of coping (Folkman, 1984), resilience (Masten, 2001), and socioecological processes (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), this article provides an in-depth account of acculturative stress and coping behaviors experienced by Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong. Using qualitative research methods, we conducted seven focus groups with a total of 32 Mainland Chinese students from a public university in Hong Kong over a 3-month period. Analytic strategy included identifying the unit of analysis, coding, sorting code, checking code, and creating salient themes. Findings suggested that Mainland Chinese university students faced acculturative stress stemming from “language barriers,” “prejudice and discrimination,” “cultural differences,” and “transport, food, and accommodation.” The study also found that the participants used a number of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies in the face of acculturative stress. As an extension of this research, future studies should examine the subtle difference between a subculture (Hong Kong) and its mother culture (Mainland China) and how that affects acculturative stress. Implications of these findings are discussed at the levels of theory, policy, and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Bhowmik, Miron Kumar;Cheung, Rebecca Y.

"Journal Article","Youth-serving institutional resources and neighborhood safety: Ties with positive youth development.","Neighborhoods are critical contexts for adolescent development, but little attention has been paid to how neighborhood characteristics play a role in positive youth development (PYD), notably among predominantly African American youth. This study examined distinct features of the neighborhood, including youth-serving institutional resources (YSI) and safety, as they relate to PYD among adolescents from low-income neighborhoods in an urban setting (n = 491, 68.6% African American). Because neighborhood experiences during adolescence often differ based on gender, we also examined moderation by gender. Results from cross-sectional, multilevel data suggest that neighborhood safety, YSIs, and gender are differentially associated with indicators of PYD (i.e., hope, mastery, friend support). The pattern of results suggested that when associated with mastery, YSIs may compensate for low-safety neighborhoods for adolescent females but not males. In terms of associations with friend support, YSIs may foster the development of PYD in low-safety neighborhoods for males but not females.

"Journal Article","Medicaid expansion and mental health: A Minnesota case study.","Introduction: The health status and psychosocial needs of the Medicaid expansion population have been estimated but not measured. This population includes childless adults predicted to have high rates of mental illness, especially among the homeless. Given limitations in access to mental health services, it is unclear how prepared the U.S. health care system is to care for the needs of the expansion population. Method: Using enrollment and claims data from the Minnesota Department of Human Services, this study presents prevalence rates of mental illness diagnoses and measures of unstable housing in Minnesota’s childless-adult early Medicaid expansion population. Rates are compared with prior predictions of serious psychological distress and mental illness constructed from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) using χ2 and t tests. Results: Diagnoses of mental illness in Minnesota’s childless-adult early Medicaid expansion population were more than 15% higher than prevalence measures of mental illness/distress for the current Medicaid population. Diagnosis rates fell within confidence intervals of estimates of mental illness for Minnesota’s Medicaid expansion population. Almost 1 in 3 enrollees had a marker of unstable housing; of this group, half had mental illness and/or distress. Discussion: Findings support predictions of the high burden of mental illness and unstable housing among the Medicaid expansion population. Minnesota offers lessons to other regions working to care for such populations: (a) the use of flexible financing structures to build integrated care systems and (b) passage of legislation to allow data sharing among mental health, social services, and medical care.

"Journal Article","Predictors of longitudinal outcomes after unstable response to acute-phase cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder.","After patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) respond to acute-phase cognitive therapy (CT), continuation-phase treatments may be applied to improve long-term outcomes. We clarified which CT responders experience remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence by testing baseline demographic, clinical, and personality variables. The sample of CT responders at higher risk of relapse (N = 241) was randomized to 8 months of continuation-phase CT, double-blinded fluoxetine, or pill placebo, and followed 24 months (Jarrett & Thase, 2010). Patients with lower positive emotionality and behavioral activation at the end of acute-phase CT showed increased risk for relapse/recurrence of MDD. In addition, patients with lower positive emotionality and behavioral activation, as well as higher residual depression (including emotional, cognitive, and social facets), showed decreased probability of remission (≥6 continuous weeks of minimal or absent symptoms) after acute-phase CT. Finally, patients with greater residual depression, as well as younger age and earlier MDD onset, showed decreased probability of recovery (≥35 continuous weeks of minimal or absent symptoms) after acute-phase CT. Moderator analyses did not reveal differential prediction across the continuation phase treatment arms. These results may help clinicians gauge the prognoses and need for continuation treatment among MDD patients who respond to acute-phase CT.

"Journal Article","Internet-based maintenance treatment for patients with eating disorders.","The sustainability of treatment effects is a major challenge in clinical practice. As in most other mental disorders, patients with eating disorders frequently experience relapses following treatment termination. This calls for feasible maintenance strategies that can be implemented in clinical routine at reasonable cost and effort for both treatment providers and patients. This article introduces an Internet-based intervention for maintenance support of patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) and related eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS). The program comprises several online components for psychoeducation, self-help, peer support, and professional counseling. In the present pilot study, 22 women had access to the program for 4 months. The intervention proved feasible and well accepted, and participants' satisfaction with the program was high. Adherence to the various program components was overall acceptable. Patterns of utilization support the assumption that patients with eating disorders have heterogeneous needs for support following treatment termination. The study confirms the potential of flexible and individually tailored Internet-based interventions for the optimization of care for these patients.

"Journal Article","A pilot study of a family cognitive adaptation training guide for individuals with schizophrenia.","Objective: There is a paucity of accessible, evidence-based tools for caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia. This study examines changes in the self-assessed and caregiver-assessed outcomes of people with schizophrenia after exposure to a cognitive adaptation training (CAT) guide that addressed pragmatic, in-home approaches to offset the cognitive impacts of the illness. Method: This study examined the 4-month, pre–post outcomes of a CAT guide, as compared with a popular, general manual, for families of individuals with schizophrenia. A total of 17 caregiver-supported individual dyads completed all measures, having been randomized to either a CAT-guide group or a support-manual group. Measures included medication adherence, adaptive functioning, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Semistructured interviews assessed use and utility questions. Results: Caregiver-assessed improvements in community functioning with medium–high effect sizes were observed in both study conditions. Self-report ratings by supported individuals did not change from baseline to 4 months and no change was observed in medication adherence or quality of life for either condition. Caregiver-burden ratings significantly declined with a large effect size, again with no difference as a function of manual type. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: These findings suggest that there is some promise in providing families with evidence-based information in manual form. Further research informed by this study’s findings should include assessments of whether and how environmental cognitive supports can be of specific benefit to families affected by schizophrenia.

"Journal Article","Change in patients’ interpersonal impacts as a mediator of the alliance-outcome association in treatment for chronic depression.","Objective: Theories posit that chronically depressed individuals have hostile and submissive interpersonal styles that undermine their interpersonal effectiveness and contribute to the cause and maintenance of their depression. Recent findings support this theory and demonstrate that chronically depressed patients’ interpersonal impacts on their therapist become more adaptive (i.e., less hostile and submissive, and more friendly and assertive) during a targeted chronic depression treatment: cognitive–behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP). In this study, the authors examined whether such changes in interpersonal impacts (as rated by clinicians’ experiences of interacting with their patients) mediated the association between early patient-rated alliance quality and final session depression. Method: Data derived from a large trial for chronic depression that compared the efficacy of CBASP, nefazodone, and their combination. The current subsample (N = 220) included patients in the CBASP and combined conditions who completed at least 1 depression assessment and the alliance measure, and whose therapists completed at least 1 interpersonal impacts assessment. Mediation models were fit using a bootstrapping procedure for assessing indirect effects. Results: As hypothesized, results supported a mediating effect; higher early alliance predicted decreases in patient hostile-submissiveness during therapy, which in turn related to lower final session depression (indirect effect B = −.02, 95% confidence interval: −.07, −.001). This indirect effect accounted for 13% of the total effect of alliance on depression. There was no moderating effect of treatment condition on the indirect effect. Conclusions: Results further support CBASP change theory and suggest a candidate mechanism of the alliance’s effect on outcome.

"Journal Article","Detecting critical decision points in psychotherapy and psychotherapy + medication for chronic depression.","Objective: We sought to quantify clinical decision points for identifying depression treatment nonremitters prior to end-of-treatment. Method: Data came from the psychotherapy arms of a randomized clinical trial for chronic depression. Participants (n = 352; 65.6% female; 92.3% White; mean age = 44.3 years) received 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) or CBASP plus an antidepressant medication. In half of the sample, receiver operating curve analyses were used to identify efficient percentage of symptom reduction cut points on the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms–Self-Report (IDS–SR) for predicting end-of-treatment nonremission based on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Cohen’s kappa for identified cut points were calculated using the remaining half of the sample. Results: Percentage of IDS–SR symptom reduction at Weeks 6 and 8 predicted end-of-treatment HRSD remission status in both the combined treatment (Week 6 cut point = 50.0%, Cohen’s κ = .42; Week 8 cut point = 54.3%, Cohen’s κ = .45) and psychotherapy only (Week 6 cut point = 60.7%, Cohen’s κ = .41; Week 8 cut point = 48.7%, Cohen’s κ = .49). Status at Week 8 was more reliable for identifying nonremitters in psychotherapy-only treatment. Conclusions: Those with chronic depression who will not remit in structured, time-limited psychotherapy for depression, either with therapy alone or in combination with antidepressant medication, are identifiable prior to end of treatment. Findings provide an operationalized strategy for designing adaptive psychotherapy interventions.

"Journal Article","Professional care as an option prior to self-harm: A qualitative study exploring young people's experiences.","Background: Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a growing problem among young people and is a major risk factor for suicide. Young adults experiencing mental distress and suicidal ideation are reluctant to seek help, requiring new strategies to reach this group. Aims: The present study explored young people's views of professional care before first contact for DSH, and factors that influenced the establishing of contact. Method: Interviews with 10 young individuals, shortly after they had harmed themselves, were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The participants emphasized the importance of receiving more knowledge on where to turn, having different help-seeking options, and receiving immediate help. Family and friends were vital for support and making health care contact. The quality of the professional contact was stressed. Several reasons for not communicating distress were mentioned. Two themes were identified: 'A need for a more flexible, available and varied health care' and 'A struggle to be independent and yet being in need of reliable support.' Conclusion: These findings suggest that easy and direct access to professional help is a decisive factor for young people experiencing psychological problems and that health services must find new ways of communicating information on seeking mental health help.

"Journal Article","Clinical considerations when intervening with individuals exposed to violence.","Objective: Clinical considerations that can be culled from the intervention research presented in this special issue are summarized for practitioners treating violence-involved (i.e., perpetrators and victims of violence) populations. Clinical reflections are organized thematically, with studies grouped based on (a) unique settings for clinical care, (b) innovative methods for clinical care, (c) advanced assessments for monitoring clinical care, and (d) co-occurring conditions to address when providing clinical care. Key Points: Unique settings for clinical service delivery, including hospitals and schools, provide opportunities for multicomponent and multidisciplinary treatment of violence-involved individuals. Innovative methods for clinical care incorporate technological advances and pharmacology to move beyond traditional service delivery techniques. Advanced assessments for clinical work consider not just psychopathology, but also adaptive functioning and cognitive sequelae when conceptualizing individuals involved in violence. HIV is one of many conditions that commonly co-occur with violence; ways to incorporate sexual risk into violence treatment and vice versa are addressed. Implications: Clinicians can consider this summary of clinical takeaway points as a practical resource for treating violence-involved populations.

When 5½ years old, the client experienced a tornado while separated from his mother and twin sister at a theme park. He developed significant symptoms of PTSD and developmental regression not present prior to the incident. Subsequent treatment from several providers and medications targeting symptoms were unsuccessful. This treatment, 1 year posttrauma, resulted in the resolution of his PTSD symptoms, reestablishment of pretraumatized development trajectory, and recovery to age-appropriate expectations and growth sustained 3 years posttrauma.

"Journal Article","Psychoeducation for children and adults after the Marmara earthquake: An evaluation study.","Education about the psychological reactions in the aftermath of a traumatic event may help reduce the adverse effects by providing a cognitive framework for one’s experience, and provides the survivors of trauma view their reactions as expectable; recognize the circumstances under which they should consider seeking further counseling; increase use of adaptive ways of coping; increase ability to help family members cope. This type of psychosocial intervention was used to reach the parents and children in the earthquake affected region after the Marmara earthquakes. The major aim of the present study is to make an assessment of the impact of these interventions. The assessment procedure consists of a satisfaction survey of the parents and children who attended the seminars. A comparison is also made between those who attended the seminars and those who did not, in terms of their opinions on issues regarding the psychological effects of the earthquakes. This report represents the data from a total of 463 parents and 774 students. In the parents group, 326 were in the comparison group and 137 were in the study group. Among the students, 181 were in the comparison group and 593 in the study group. Two questionnaires were used to collect data from the participants in the study. One questionnaire was for children over 12 years of age, and the other was for the parents. The results in general showed that, the seminars were helpful for parents and children to learn about the psychological reactions people have after earthquakes. However, they also showed that, to be more effective, there is a need for improvement in the way the seminars are conducted.

"Journal Article","A review and meta-analysis of perfectionism interventions: Comparing face-to-face with online modalities.","Extending Lloyd, Schmidt, Khondoker, and Tchanturia (2015), this review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of randomized controlled trials aimed at reducing perfectionism and associated symptoms of depression and anxiety. Of particular interest was the examination of a moderator of delivery method (face-to-face vs. online) in testing the effectiveness of psychological interventions. Also examined is the effect of two structural moderators (control condition type, sample characteristic). A total of 10 studies were identified (65 perfectionism effect sizes, 8 depression effect sizes, and 8 anxiety effect sizes). Psychological interventions were effective in decreasing perfectionism dimensions, depression, and anxiety with medium effect sizes. There were no significant differences in delivery modality, control condition type, and sample characteristic on effect sizes. Findings suggest that psychological interventions are generally effective in reducing perfectionism, although there is no apparent delineation in increasing “adaptive” perfectionism and decreasing “maladaptive” perfectionism. Although comparable benefits were shown in face-to-face and online intervention delivery modes, we suggest prudently incorporating online interventions into clinical practice.

"Comment/Reply","Commentary: 'Treatment Is Not Enough: We Must Prevent Depression in Women,' by Le, Munoz, Ippen and Stoddard (2003).","Le, Munoz, Ippen and Stoddard (2003) made a compelling argument for making depression prevention in women a national priority. They noted the limited amount of research on depression prevention and emphasized the need for growth in this area. We discuss several issues in our commentary that deserve further thought and consideration. Given the high prevalence of depression and the prevalence of associated psychosocial and economic risk factors (e.g., poverty, stress), we question whether universal prevention efforts are appropriate. We also note that social, economic, and political factors likely influence women's risk for depression. A major challenge of future prevention research in this area will be to incorporate other disciplines in the task of understanding the relationships among these factors. Gaining a better conceptual understanding of the nature of these complex relationships will enable us to develop better risk profiles and to develop conceptual models that will be flexible enough to incorporate the diversity in women's gender socialization, educational and economic status, racial and ethnic identity, acculturation, and so forth.

"Journal Article","Present, protective, and promotive: Mentors’ roles in the lives of young adults in residential care.","Mentoring relationships are considered among the most significant relationships with nonparental figures and a protective factor against a wide range of negative outcomes. This exploratory study explored mentoring relationships in the lives of 140 care leavers, and the way those relationships influenced their life course. Findings showed that most of the mentors were known to the young adults from their former care placement for 3 years and above. Thematic analysis revealed 2 main “types” of mentor: (1) a present, accessible and supportive mentor, who is mainly characterized as a parental figure and a role model, a life coach who is also a confidant; (2) a motivating and catalyzing mentor, who is characterized as promoting adaptive coping with life stressors, and leading the young adults to set and achieve their goals and change their behavioral and mental status for the better. The discussion addresses the contribution of mentoring relationships to the young adults’ resilience in reference to social support and attachment theories. It discusses the importance of promoting a “mentoring policy” within the residential care settings, to enable youth to continue their relationships with their mentors during their challenging transition to emerging adulthood.

"Journal Article","Best practices and recommendations for digital interventions to improve engagement and adherence in chronic illness sufferers.","Chronic illnesses cause considerable burden in quality of life, often leading to physical, psychological, and social dysfunctioning of the sufferers and their family. There is a growing need for flexible provision of home-based psychological services to increase reach even for traditionally underserved chronic illness sufferer populations. Digital interventions can fulfill this role and provide a range of psychological services to improve functioning. Despite the potential of digital interventions, concerns remain regarding users’ engagement, as low engagement is associated with low adherence rates, high attrition, and suboptimal exposure to the intervention. Human–computer interaction (e.g., theoretical models of persuasive system design, gamification, tailoring, and supportive accountability) and user characteristics (e.g., gender, age, computer literacy) are the main identified culprits contributing to engagement and adherence difficulties. To date, there have not been any clear and concise recommendations for improved utilization and engagement in digital interventions. This paper provides an overview of user engagement factors and proposes research informed recommendations for engagement and adherence planning in digital intervention development. The recommendations were derived from the literature and consensualized by expert members of the European Federation of Psychology Associations, Psychology and Health Standing Committee, and e-Health Task Force. These recommendations serve as a starting point for researchers and clinicians interested in the digitalized health field and promote effective planning for engagement when developing digital interventions with the potential to maximize adherence and optimal exposure in the treatment of chronic health conditions.

"Journal Article","Nonattachment and mindfulness: Related but distinct constructs.","In this study, we examined whether nonattachment, a relatively new construct in the mindfulness literature, showed convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity in relation to the well-studied 5 facets of mindfulness. Mindfulness was defined as a multifaceted construct including observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity; and measured using the recently validated, 20-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Tran, Glück, & Nader, 2013; Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006). Nonattachment was defined as a flexible, balanced way of relating to one’s experiences without clinging to or suppressing them, and measured using the 7-item Nonattachment Scale (NAS-7; Elphinstone, Sahdra, & Ciarrochi, 2015; Sahdra, Shaver, & Brown, 2015). In a large nationally representative sample of Americans (N = 7,884; 52% women; age, M = 47.9, SD = 16), nonattachment was positively related to all 5 aspects of mindfulness. Structural equation modeling showed that the 20-item FFMQ and NAS-7 showed good fit; their factor structures were invariant across genders and age groups; and NAS-7 was empirically distinguishable from the 5 mindfulness facets.

"Journal Article","The protective function of personal growth initiative among a genocide-affected population in Rwanda.","The aim of the current study was to investigate the extent to which individual differences in personal growth initiative (PGI) were associated with lower reports of functional impairment of daily activities among a genocide-affected population in Rwanda. PGI measures an individual’s motivation to develop as a person and the extent to which he or she is active in setting goals that work toward achieving self-improvement. We found that PGI was negatively associated with functional impairment when controlling for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other demographic factors. Our results suggest that PGI may constitute an important mindset for facilitating adaptive functioning in the aftermath of adversity and in the midst of psychological distress, and as such they might have practical applications for the development of intervention programs.

The participant was a 9-year old girl with a severe disability and problem behaviors. Experimental procedures included functional analysis, extinction, and functional communication training. Results showed that in accordance with the matching theory, responses (problem or adaptive) that were continuously reinforced occurred at a higher rate when compared to responses on extinction. In addition, extinction for some problem responses increased the rate of nontargeted problem responses; however, concurrent reinforcement of a newly learned functionally equivalent communication response increased the rate of this behavior and decreased all problem behaviors.

"Journal Article","War trauma, psychological distress, and coping among Afghan civilians seeking primary health care.","The present study examined the relationship between war trauma and distress and the potential moderating role of emotion and social, avoidant, and religious coping among 81 participants seeking medical services at a primary care clinic in Kabul. Local Afghan researchers administered the Afghan Symptom Checklist, Afghan War Experiences Scale, a brief scale of other non-war-related traumatic experiences, two subscales of the COPE, an Avoidant Coping Scale, and a demographics questionnaire, and conducted a brief semistructured interview. Results revealed a significant contribution of war-related traumatic events (11%) to symptoms of distress and an additional contribution of nonwar-related trauma (7%) to distress (p’s ≤ .01). Emotion and social coping and avoidant coping were positively correlated with distress (r = .23, and .60, respectively) and did not moderate the relationship between war trauma and distress. Qualitative responses were also recorded regarding various coping strategies and shed light on specific ways in which participants dealt with trauma. Demographics revealed that women reported higher symptom levels than men (p < .05), and age was positively correlated with symptoms, while education showed a negative relation with symptoms (r = .46 and −.22, respectively). While traumatic events were positively associated with distress, adaptive coping strategies that mitigated this distress were not identified by the quantitative analyses. Qualitative data suggested that religious practices, staying busy, and seeking help from others were the most frequently reported coping strategies. It is important to continue to explore these factors and others that may help mitigate the impact of traumatic events in this culture.

"Journal Article","Is the association between sexual satisfaction and neuroticism in treatment-seeking couples curvilinear?","Neuroticism is generally regarded as an inherently negative characteristic. However, previous findings suggest that this trait may have adaptive features in the context of close relationships. The current study examined the curvilinear association among neuroticism and sexual satisfaction in both partners of couples from a clinical population. The sample was composed of 539 treatment-seeking couples who completed measures of personality and sexual satisfaction. Results indicated that very low to low levels of self-reported neuroticism were positively associated with self-reported sexual satisfaction, whereas low to high levels were negatively associated with sexual satisfaction. Thus, both very low and high levels of neuroticism predicted poorer sexual satisfaction, whereas low to moderate levels of neuroticism predicted higher levels of sexual satisfaction. This association remained significant after controlling for the other dimensions of the five-factor model of personality. The current findings suggest that, in clinical couples, the association between neuroticism and couple outcomes may be more complex than the linear relation that has been the focus of past studies.

The theoretical basis, mechanism of change, and research support for three of the UP-A’s guiding treatment principles are presented. Verbal exchanges between UP-A therapists and adolescent clients are shared to demonstrate clinical processes related to UP-A techniques that follow such guiding principles. The benefits of this approach to treatment are discussed, including reduction in the number of evidence-based treatment manuals to be learned, administered, and supervised. The UP-A has demonstrated positive outcomes, yet further examination of clinical process variables is warranted. These clinical process variables and additional future directions for the UP-A are addressed.

"Review-Book","Review of Reaching out: The psychology of assertive outreach.","Reviews the book, Reaching out: The psychology of assertive outreach by Caroline Cupitt (see record 2009-16331-000). Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an evidence based service-delivery model that provides comprehensive, practical, flexible, team based treatment for people with serious and persistent mental illnesses. This book is an interesting collection of chapters edited by Caroline Cupitt that describes the experiences of implementing assertive outreach in Great Britain and the value of psychological approaches within an outreach team. The authors argue that assertive outreach is a very powerful intervention, but that ACT teams often lack valuable psychotherapeutic depth. The book is divided into two sections. Part I: Taking a Psychological Approach, includes five chapters describing the authors' strategies for incorporating psychological components into assertive outreach teams and two chapters on teamwork. Part II of the book includes five chapters on delivering psychological therapies within the context of assertive outreach. On balance, this book is an interesting and reasonably useful book. Like most edited volumes, some chapters are better than others and most readers will pay close attention to some parts and skim through others.

"Journal Article","An interprofessional care model for evaluating autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) among low-income children.","The worldwide prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is increasing, which will likely result in a growth of programs targeting the assessment and intervention needs of this population. However, there are few published studies documenting the development of programs that can serve as a valuable tool for communication of optimal service delivery and common obstacles and challenges. Programs targeting low-income, ethnically diverse populations are particularly imperative given the existing socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in ASD assessment and diagnosis. This article outlines the development of the MetroHealth Autism Assessment Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, an interprofessional clinic targeting the assessment and diagnosis of ASDs in children ages 24 to 48 months from an inner-city underprivileged Medicaid population. In line with our goals of increasing diagnostic efficiency and care coordination, we examined clinical outcomes relative to preclinic data in time to diagnosis, number of providers seen prior to diagnosis, and number of “no-show” appointments. Results indicated significantly reduced time to diagnoses relative to preclinic data, likely associated with better care coordination. Number of providers seen and no-show appointments were not significantly different. Establishment of the clinic has enabled us to connect patients to community-based resources in a timely manner, potentially reducing disparities in ASD diagnosis and intervention. Obstacles have included scheduling monthly clinical staff meetings and procuring funding for a patient navigator. Future objectives include launching a parent support group and implementing short-term cognitive–behavioral therapy-based interventions for mothers of newly diagnosed children.

Guided by a social ecological perspective on child health, the Pediatric Psychosocial Preventative Health Model (PPPHM) is a 3-tier model based on a public health orientation. The goal of the PPPHM is to conceptualize how families of acutely and chronically ill children might be provided psychosocial support to match their level of need and risk. The largest group of families, Universal, consists of competent and adaptive families confronting health-related stressors. A smaller group of families, Targeted, is at some elevated risk for ongoing psychosocial difficulties. The smallest group of families, Clinical/Treatment, exhibits more evident symptomatology. Examples of family and systems interventions that integrate care among behavioral health care providers and within multidisciplinary treatment teams, across levels of the PPPHM, are presented and discussed.

"Journal Article","Genetics, family systems, and multicultural influences.","With groundbreaking advances in genomic research, the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of most health and mental health disorders will increasingly be understood as having a genetic component. This article provides an overview of the family systems genetic illness (FSGI) model to address the psychosocial challenges of genomic conditions for patients and their families and to help provide a biopsychosocial framework for clinical practice and research. The author also discusses some of the data highlighting the importance of multicultural issues in genetic screening and testing and the need for further research in this area. The FSGI model clusters genomic disorders on the basis of key characteristics that define types of disorders with similar patterns of psychosocial demands over time. Key disease variables include the likelihood of developing a disorder, based on specific genetic mutations; overall clinical severity; timing of clinical onset in the life cycle; and whether effective treatment interventions exist to alter disease onset or progression. Core nonsymptomatic time phases with key developmental challenges are described pre- and posttesting, including a long-term adaptation phase. The model is designed to be flexible and responsive to future discoveries in genomic research. Examples of its utility are discussed for preventive screening, family assessment and consultation, treatment planning, and service delivery in a variety of health care settings.

"Journal Article","Evaluating postdeployment training for coping with intrusive cognition: A comparison of training approaches.","Objective: Although intrusive cognition (IC) is remarkably common in soldiers postdeployment and successful coping with ICs may predict better long-term psychological health, few elements of current programmatic postdeployment trainings have directly addressed adaptive strategies for managing intrusive deployment-related cognitions. The current study explored the efficacy of a brief acceptance-based skills training for coping with ICs relative to a change-based skills training, a psychoeducation-only training, or training as usual. Method: Participants were 1,524 (1,372 men) active-duty U.S. Army soldiers between 3 and 12 months’ postdeployment. Results: Soldiers who received acceptance-based training demonstrated larger reductions in distress and impairment related to ICs about deployment at 1 month follow-up and larger reductions in symptoms of PTSD and general psychopathology relative to other training conditions. In contrast, participants in the change-oriented skills training showed relatively fewer benefits than did those in the acceptance-based training. In addition, soldiers who received the psychoeducation-only training showed no benefits relative to training as usual. Conclusions: Results suggest that brief trainings focused on postdeployment ICs may have benefits for soldiers up to 1 month later and may be a useful addition to a broader postdeployment transition program. Findings also indicate that an acceptance-based training approach may be more beneficial than a change-oriented approach for helping soldiers manage ICs and that psychoeducation alone may be insufficient for helping soldiers manage these cognitions.

"Journal Article","A stepped care approach to clinical suicide prevention.","Despite the enormous humanitarian and economic toll of suicide, mental health systems of care are largely underprepared to work effectively with suicidal individuals and suicide is a leading “Sentinel Event” in U.S. health care settings (The Joint Commission, 2016). In response to these concerns, a recent policy initiative called “Zero Suicide” has advocated a systems-level response to the suicidal risk within health care and this policy initiative is yielding positive results (Hogan & Goldstein Grumet, 2016). Along these lines, a “stepped care” approach developed by Jobes (2016) has been adapted and used within the Zero Suicide curriculum as a model for systems-level care that is suicide-specific, evidence-based, least-restrictive, and cost-effective. The Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is an example of one suicide-specific evidence-based clinical intervention that can be adapted and used across the full range of stepped care service settings (Jobes, 2016). This article describes various applications and uses of CAMS at all service levels and highlights CAMS-related innovations. It is argued that psychological services are uniquely poised to make a major difference in clinical suicide prevention through a systems-level approach using evidence-based care such as CAMS.

"Journal Article","Treating inhalant abuse in adolescence: A recorded music expressive arts intervention.","Inhalant abuse is a significant public health problem that disproportionately affects adolescents. It is therefore critical to advance research on effective interventions to treat this vulnerable population. Because inhalant abuse is well known to compromise neuropsychological functioning, learning, and memory, it creates challenges for language-based psychotherapy. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of a new multimodal therapy—which we refer to as recorded music expressive arts (RMEA)—on symptom reduction and enhanced coping. Through a single case design (16-week ABA design: 3-week baseline, 10-week intervention, and 3-week postintervention), RMEA (involving songwriting, recording, and music production) was evaluated for effectiveness in psychotherapy with a 14-year-old White male, who was experiencing significant neuropsychological sequelae secondary to 3 months of inhalant abuse. It was hypothesized that the RMEA intervention would (a) ameliorate symptoms of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Symptom Checklist-90-R, (b) reduce psychiatric symptoms as measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-R, and (c) increase the use of adaptive coping strategies as measured by Adolescent Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced. Visual inspection of scale score trends partially supported Hypothesis 1 and more strongly supported Hypothesis 2 and 3. The results suggest that RMEA may be promising in further research with adolescent mental health, especially with those individuals who are in treatment for inhalant abuse—an often difficult-to-treat population refractory to language-based therapeutic approaches.

"Journal Article","PTSD as a moderator of a parenting intervention for military families.","The stress of multiple deployments and exposure to combat places service members at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may detrimentally affect parenting. Evidence-based parenting programs have been successful in promoting adaptive parenting practices among families exposed to stress. However, the effects of preventive interventions on parenting may vary by military parent’s PTSD. The current study includes families who participated in a randomized controlled trial of a parenting intervention for military families known as After Deployment, Adaptive Parenting Tools (ADAPT). Families were randomized to either a 14-week, group-based parenting program or a comparison group. Participants included families with 4- to 12-year-old children in which at least 1 parent deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan (N = 336; 945 individuals). Structural equation modeling was used to examine parent self-reported PTSD as a potential moderator of the relationship between intent-to-treat status and effective parenting practices 12 months postbaseline while accounting for baseline effective parenting, length and number of deployments, and family demographics. Father PTSD was a significant moderator, such that the intervention was less effective for fathers who met clinical levels of PTSD. No significant moderation effects were found among mothers. These findings may have important implications for the development of future evidence-based parenting programs.

"Journal Article","Employee resilience: Directions for resilience development.","Resilience in organizations denotes system agility and robustness, essential to survival and thriving in increasingly challenging contexts. Contemporary scholarship has acknowledged the relationship between employee resilience and organizational resilience. Yet interventions aimed at developing employee resilience tend to use stress and well-being as proxy resilience indicators, focusing primarily on individual rehabilitation or the development of personal resources. We argue that these interventions should also consider the development of organizational resources that ensure both the inherent and adaptive resilience of employees. This article introduces employee resilience as behavioral capability, signaled by adaptive, learning, and network-leveraging behaviors, and it discusses ways in which supportive organizational contexts enable the development and enactment of these behaviors. The article proposes a series of resilience-building initiatives, embedded in everyday practice, and elucidates how leading and organizing for the development of employee resilience contributes to improved well-being and performance.

"Journal Article","Sociodemographic outcomes from an urban pediatric obesity program.","Objective: Pediatric weight management programs are plagued by insufficient changes in standardized body mass index (zBMI), disproportionately impacting racial minorities. Treatment outcomes of a pediatric weight management program with a large and diverse baseline sample were evaluated. Demographic and socioeconomic predictors of change in zBMI after 1 year were examined separately to identify characteristics contributing to treatment outcomes. It was hypothesized that socioeconomic disparities would account for lower zBMI outcomes above and beyond demographic factors. Method: Data were collected from 1,784 youth at baseline (n = 271 at 12 months; age M = 11.89 years, SD = 3.15). Information on zBMI, demographics (sex, race, age, mother’s body mass index [BMI]) and socioeconomic status (SES; health insurance, number parents in home) were collected at baseline and 12 months post intervention. Results: After 1 year, average change in zBMI was −0.12 (SD = 0.21). Linear hierarchical regression analysis assessed if SES factors predicted change in zBMI after 12 months above and beyond demographic factors. Demographics were entered in Block 1, and SES factors in Block 2. The final model significantly accounted for 14.2% of variance in change in zBMI (p < .000). Examining blocks separately indicated SES variables did not significantly add to the model beyond demographic variables, contributing to less than 1.0% of the variance. Unique predictors included age, and mother’s BMI. Conclusions: Participation in the program was associated with decreases in zBMI for youth who completed the year of treatment and follow-ups. Factors related to age and family had the largest association with weight loss. SES factors were not related to change in zBMI beyond demographic factors.

"Editorial","“That’s why they call it practice”.","The authors discuss how, as their residency family medicine practices are transforming into Patient-Centered Medical Homes, they are witnessing shifting expectations for everyone: medical assistant, faculty and resident physician, licensed practical nurse, behavioral health clinician. At all levels of experience and expertise, they are called on to change. In the health care context, “practice” has multiple meanings. Practice, in the sense of “the clinical scope of work we do every day” corresponds to Merriam Webster’s first definition of the word, “to be professionally engaged in” or “to do or perform often, customarily, or habitually.” In this editorial, the authors call upon their colleagues to recognize the second definition of “practice” and build in opportunities to “train by repeated exercises” within day to day clinical activity. By this they mean, build in mechanisms to prompt reflection on your work, every day, seeking and incorporating feedback from others on your team. Effective primary care systems protect time for practice and learning. These organizations demonstrate “adaptive reserve,” consisting of action and reflection cycles, facilitative leadership, a learning culture, the ability to improvise, and effective relationships and communication.

"Journal Article","Choice and outcome in mental health supported housing.","Objective: This paper discusses choice in mental health supported housing, providing results from a longitudinal study of two models of supported housing (a higher support and a lower support model). Methods: The progress of 27 tenants at the two sites was tracked on measures of satisfaction with housing, social support satisfaction, mental health, physical health, and mastery over the course of one year. Measurements were taken at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Results: Although there were trends toward positive changes at both sites, with the Bonferroni adjustment, only positive within group changes in perceptions of physical health between baseline and 12 months at the higher support site endured. There were no significant differences in changes between the two sites. Conclusions: We conclude that there appears to be some support for the positive effects of choice in mental health supported housing. Further research in this area will require flexible programming and funding that create opportunities for true partnerships with consumer-survivors.

"Journal Article","A pilot study of “Gutstrong” for adolescents with functional gastrointestinal disorders.","The objective of this study was to provide preliminary findings of efficacy and acceptability for “Gutstrong,” a minimal contact cognitive–behavioral treatment program being developed for adolescents with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Twenty adolescents (13 to 17 years) presenting for initial subspecialty evaluation of chronic abdominal pain were randomized to receive (a) standard medical care only or (b) standard medical care plus “Gutstrong.” Adolescents completing “Gutstrong” self-reported decreased frequency of pain episodes, increased health-related quality of life and percentage of pain-free days, and improvements in adaptive coping compared with the control group. “Gutstrong” was rated as helpful, informative, and acceptable, with minor improvements suggested. “Gutstrong” has the potential to be a beneficial adjunct to standard medical care for adolescents with FGIDs. The efficacy, appeal, and cost-effectiveness of this program warrant further evaluation as part of a large-scale clinical trial. Application to other age groups and patient populations also should be considered in future steps.

Author Ruth Lanius’s name was misspelled as Ruth Lanins; author Scot McNary’s name was misspelled Scott McNary; author Clare Pain’s name was misspelled Claire Pain; and the affiliation for Richard Loewenstein should have read Sheppard Pratt Health System. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2009-08949-005.) The goals of this naturalistic, cross-sectional study were to describe the patient, therapist, and therapeutic conditions of an international sample of dissociative disorder (DD) patients treated by community therapists and to determine if community treatment for DD appears to be as effective as treatment for chronic PTSD and conditions comorbid with DD. Analyses found that across both patient (N = 280) and therapist (N = 292) reports, patients in the later stages of treatment engaged in fewer self-injurious behaviors, had fewer hospitalizations, and showed higher levels of various measures of adaptive functioning (e.g., GAF) than those in the initial stage of treatment. Additionally, patients in the later stages of treatment reported lower symptoms of dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder, and distress than patients in the initial stage of treatment. The effect sizes for Stage 5 versus Stage 1 differences in DD treatment were comparable to those published for chronic PTSD associated with childhood trauma and depression comorbid with borderline personality disorder. Given the prevalence, severity, chronicity, and high health care costs associated with DD, these results suggest that extended treatment for DD may be beneficial and merits further research.

"Journal Article","An investigation of the influence of case and clinician gender in clinical decision-making.","The present study was intended to assess the reliability of clinician judgments, with a particular interest in how such judgments vary by the gender of the case vignette and clinician. A national sample of 123 mental health professionals (57.7% male) provided clinical judgments on 12 case vignettes primarily representing personality pathology; two identical versions of each vignette were prepared, with the only difference being the use of masculine or feminine pronouns identifying the client. Clinical judgments included evaluations of adaptive functioning, long-term prognostic assessments, short-term risk evaluations, and treatment recommendations. Analyses included intraclass correlations between clinicians to assess reliability, as well as an examination of the variance of clinical judgments as a function of the identified gender of the case and the gender of the participating clinician. No significant two-way interactions were found between case gender and clinician gender in predicting the clinical judgments. A significant main effect of case gender in predicting vocational functioning was observed, such that female cases were rated as having better estimated vocational functioning than male cases. In addition, a significant main effect of clinician gender in predicting aggression and violence risk was found, such that ratings by female clinicians were higher than ratings by male clinicians. Results offer little if any evidence to suggest the influence of client or clinician gender on the majority of clinical judgments made in the present study. However, these results bear replication, particularly in light of the two significant main effects that did emerge.

Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS® CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS® domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS® anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS® CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

"Journal Article","Statistical models for multilevel skewed physical activity data in health research and behavioral medicine.","Objective: Researchers who study physical activity often use outcome variables that have a lower bound of zero and are positively skewed (e.g., minutes of physical activity in a day). Researchers also often use statistical methods that assume the outcome is normally distributed or transform the outcome as an attempt to make it more normal, both of which can be problematic. In this article, the authors describe multilevel 2-part models that use a mixture of logistic regression—to predict whether a person was active—and gamma regression—to predict amount of activity if there was activity. Method: The authors contrast the 2-part models to a linear multilevel model using data from a longitudinal study of physical activity (N = 113; 2,305 observations). The dependent variable was minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity in a day and the predictor variables were day, satisfaction, and gender. Results: The 2-part models outperform the linear model and provide researchers critical information that is conceptually relevant, such as distinguishing between predictors of whether activity occurred and of how much activity occurred. Conclusions: Two-part models represent a flexible and useful addition to the analysis repertoire of health researchers. To assist researchers in learning these methods, the online supplemental materials provide additional technical information as well as annotated computer code for estimating these models.

"Journal Article","Early outcomes and lessons learned from a study of the Building Recovery of Individual Dreams and Goals through Education and Support (BRIDGES) program in Tennessee.","Objective: Peer-led education interventions have the potential to provide mental health consumers with the knowledge, skills and support they need to live successful and rewarding self-determined lives. However, few studies have explored whether and how these interventions enhance recovery. This study addresses this knowledge gap by examining changes among 160 participants in the Building Recovery of Individual Dreams and Goals (BRIDGES) education program. BRIDGES is a peer-led 8-week course taught by trained instructors who publicly disclose the fact that they are in recovery from mental illness. Method: Structured interviews assessing recovery outcomes were conducted with participants in the month prior to their receipt of BRIDGES, and immediately after receipt of the intervention. Paired t-tests were conducted to examine changes in psychiatric symptoms, hopefulness, social support, self-advocacy, empowerment, adaptive coping, and recovery pre-receipt and post-receipt of BRIDGES. Results: Post-receipt of BRIDGES, participants reported significantly fewer psychiatric symptoms, decreased use of maladaptive coping behaviors, and increased feelings of hopefulness, self-advocacy, empowerment, and recovery. Conclusions: These promising early results from our ongoing study of BRIDGES suggest that peer-led education interventions are a valuable resource. Additional research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of these interventions, including potential long-term post-program participation benefits.

"Journal Article","Translation of associative learning models into extinction reminders delivered via mobile phones during cue exposure interventions for substance use.","Despite experimental findings and some treatment research supporting the use of cues as a means to induce and extinguish cravings, interventions using cue exposure have not been well integrated into contemporary substance abuse treatments. A primary problem with exposure-based interventions for addiction is that after learning not to use substances in the presence of addiction cues inside the clinic (i.e., extinction), stimuli in the naturalistic setting outside the clinic may continue to elicit craving, drug use, or other maladaptive conditioned responses. For exposure-based substance use interventions to be efficacious, new approaches are needed that can prevent relapse by directly generalizing learning from the therapeutic setting into naturalistic settings associated with a high risk for relapse. Basic research suggests that extinction reminders (ERs) can be paired with the context of learning new and more adaptive conditioned responses to substance abuse cues in exposure therapies for addiction. Using mobile phones and automated dialing and data collection software, ERs can be delivered in everyday high-risk settings to inhibit conditioned responses to substance-use-related stimuli. In this review, we describe how associative learning mechanisms (e.g., conditioned inhibition) can inform how ERs are conceptualized, learned, and implemented to prevent substance use when delivered via mobile phones. This approach, exposure with portable reminders of extinction, is introduced as an adjunctive intervention that uses brief automated ERs between clinic visits when individuals are in high-risk settings for drug use.

"Journal Article","Q-learning: A data analysis method for constructing adaptive interventions.","Increasing interest in individualizing and adapting intervention services over time has led to the development of adaptive interventions. Adaptive interventions operationalize the individualization of a sequence of intervention options over time via the use of decision rules that input participant information and output intervention recommendations. We introduce Q-learning, which is a generalization of regression analysis to settings in which a sequence of decisions regarding intervention options or services is made. The use of Q is to indicate that this method is used to assess the relative quality of the intervention options. In particular, we use Q-learning with linear regression to estimate the optimal (i.e., most effective) sequence of decision rules. We illustrate how Q-learning can be used with data from sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs; Murphy, 2005) to inform the construction of a more deeply tailored sequence of decision rules than those embedded in the SMART design. We also discuss the advantages of Q-learning compared to other data analysis approaches. Finally, we use the Adaptive Interventions for Children With ADHD SMART study (Center for Children and Families, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, William E. Pelham as principal investigator) for illustration.

Throughout 10 years of data collection, Palestinian-Arab culture and Islamic faith have consistently emerged as important factors that can be considered when interpreting this participant’s general level of autonomy, medical autonomy, medical adherence, and psychological adjustment. This case study examines important aspects of adaptive and independent functioning for youth with spina bifida and how this family’s culture interacts with these different domains of functioning. In order to fully capture this family’s distinct lived experience, this case study reviews both quantitative data and qualitative data, highlighting the importance of considering context when performing clinical research. Moreover, it explores potential conflicts between an Arab collectivist family structure and Western biomedical ethics and suggests how clinicians might navigate these conflicts and bolster culturally rooted strengths of families and patients from non-Western backgrounds.

"Journal Article","Dynamic conflicts in recurrent major depression: Does combined short-term psychotherapy and antidepressive medication lead to healthy dynamic functioning?","After Malan, Heath, Bacal, and Balfour’s (1975) pioneering empirical work, there has been a growing interest in studying whether psychotherapy improves dynamic conflicts. We examined whether dynamic conflicts and adaptation to conflicts improve following short-term psychotherapy. Twelve patients with acute recurrent major depression were randomized to receive antidepressive medications plus 20 sessions of either cognitive–behavioral or dynamic psychotherapy. The Psychodynamic Conflict Rating Scales (PCRS) assessed conflicts and adaptation to conflicts at intake and 1-year follow-up. The Hamilton and Beck Depression Scales assessed depression, and defenses were rated at intake and at 1 year. Significant change was found on measures of depression. Dynamic conflicts showed significant improvement in levels of adaptation (median/mean effect size = 1.41/.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.03, 1.81]). However, change in Overall Pathological Conflict scores was not significant (median/mean effect size = 1.23/.85, 95% CI [−.28, 1.99]), principally because 1/3 of subjects failed to progress in this time frame. At 1 year, change in Overall Pathological Conflict scores correlated with self-report (rs = −.72, 95% CI [−94, .01]) but not observer-rated depression. At 1 year, PCRS Conflict scores were correlated with defensive functioning (rs = .77, 95% CI [−.95, −.10]). Short-term psychotherapy was associated with improvement in depression and adaptation to conflict, but there was more heterogeneity in improvement in conflict pathology. The PCRS showed convergent validity with defensive functioning. Longer term therapies and follow-up may be required to develop dynamic recovery and resistance to recurrences of major depression.

"Journal Article","Comprehensive grief care for children and families: Policy and practice implications.","Since the 1998 publication of the groundbreaking Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kaiser Permanente, increased research and funding has focused on mitigating experiences that place children at risk for developmental disruption. Surprisingly, the death of a parent, sibling, or other important attachment figure—often noted as one of the most disruptive and potentially traumatic experiences for a child—has received relatively little attention in these efforts. This article explores the current landscape of support for grieving children and families— including significant barriers to care and gaps in empirical knowledge. Given the complexity of the issue and the nascent state of the childhood bereavement field, it is fertile ground for social innovations that challenge current norms. In addition, the argument is made for a strengths-based, wellness approach to childhood bereavement that seizes upon opportunities to both promote adaptive adjustment and prevent further complications of unaddressed grief and trauma.

"Journal Article","Discrimination, segregation, and chronic inflammation: Testing the weathering explanation for the poor health of Black Americans.","Several studies have reported a relation between race-related stressors and the poor health of Black Americans. Such findings raise questions regarding the mediating biological mechanisms that might account for this link. The present study investigated elevated systemic inflammation, a factor shown to be a strong predictor of chronic illness and mortality in all ethnic populations, as a possible factor. Using 7 waves of data from the Family and Community Health Study, collected over a 20-year period from over 400 Black Americans, we investigated the extent to which exposure to discrimination and segregation at various points in the life course predicted adult inflammation at age 28. Our analyses examined whether cumulative stress, stress generation, or predictive adaptive response (PAR) models best accounted for any associations that existed between these race-related stressors and adult inflammation. At every wave of data collection, assessments of discrimination and segregation were related to adult inflammation. However, multivariate analyses using structure equation modeling indicated that the PAR model best explained the effect of these race-related stressors on inflammation. Exposure to discrimination and segregation during the juvenile years predicted adult inflammation and amplified the inflammatory effect of adult exposure to these race-related stressors. These effects were considerably more robust than that of traditional health risk factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and low SES. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the limitations of the widely accepted risk factor approach to increasing the health of Black Americans.

"Journal Article","Sensory processing, participation, and recovery in adults with serious mental illnesses.","Objective: People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) have different sensory processing patterns compared to the general population. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between different sensory processing patterns and community participation and recovery-oriented outcomes to inform the development of innovative rehabilitation interventions, including those resulting in more accommodating environments. Methods: A quasi-experimental, comparative research design was conducted by using data obtained from 95 adults with SMI who received public mental health services. Participants completed a sensory processing profile and measures of community participation, recovery, and quality of life. Comparisons were made between sensory profile categories for each dependent variable using multivariate analyses of variance. Results: The category with more evidence of self-reported low registration and sensory sensitivity than most reported less participation and lower levels of recovery than did their peers with processing patterns in typical ranges. The category with more self-reported sensory sensitivity than most reported lower quality of life. Finally, the category in the “similar” to “more than most” range on self-reported sensory seeking had higher levels of participation and recovery. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Assessment of sensory processing patterns in adults with SMI can inform sensory-based interventions that might result in greater community participation and other recovery outcomes. Interventions can include those that seek to enhance person–environment fit by altering the environment, as well as interventions that enhance adaptive sensory responses to external stimuli.

"Journal Article","A longitudinal naturalistic study of patients with dissociative disorders treated by community clinicians.","Severe dissociative disorders (DD) are associated with high levels of impairment, treatment utilization, and treatment costs, yet relatively little systematic research has focused on treatment for these challenging patients. The goal of this naturalistic observational 30-month follow-up study of an international sample of patients with dissociative disorders was to determine if treatment provided by community providers was associated with improvements in symptoms and adaptive functioning. The patients were diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (DID) and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS). The patients and their therapists completed surveys at study entry and at 6-, 18-, and 30-month follow-up. At the 30-month follow-up, 119 of the original 226 patients completed the surveys. According to patients’ reports, they showed decreased levels of dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, general distress, drug use, physical pain, and depression over the course of treatment. As treatment progressed, patients reported increased socializing, attending school or volunteering, and feeling good. According to therapists’ reports, patients engaged in less self-injurious behavior and had fewer hospitalizations as well as increased global assessment of functioning scores (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and adaptive capacities over time. These results suggest that treatment provided by therapists who have training in treating DID/DDNOS appears to be beneficial across a number of clinical domains. Additional research into the treatment of DD is warranted.

Method: A detailed step-by-step explanation of how control engineering methods can be used with intensive longitudinal data to design an adaptive intensive intervention is provided. The methods are evaluated via simulation. Results: Simulation results illustrate how the designed adaptive intensive intervention can result in improved outcomes with less treatment by providing treatment only when it is needed. Furthermore, the methods are robust to model misspecification as well as the influence of unobserved causes.

This study tailored the frequency of home visits in a prevention program for aggressive- disruptive children (n = 410; 56% minority) on the basis of 2 kinds of clinical judgment: ratings of parental functioning using a standardized multi-item scale and global assessments of family need for services. Stronger reliability and better concurrent and predictive validity emerged for the 1st kind of clinical judgment than for the 2nd.

"Journal Article","Video-based mobile health interventions for people with schizophrenia: Bringing the “pocket therapist” to life.","Objective: To examine whether video-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions are feasible, acceptable, understandable, and engaging to people with schizophrenia. Method: This study used a mixed-methods design. Ten individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited for a month-long trial in which they used FOCUS-Audio/Video (FOCUS–AV), a smartphone system that offers video and written intervention options. Participants completed posttrial measures and engaged in semistructured interviews. Findings: One participant dropped out. The remaining 9 participants used intervention videos successfully. Participants responded to 67% of system-delivered prompts to engage FOCUS–AV, and 52% of FOCUS–AV use was initiated by the users. On average, participants used interventions 6 days a week, 4 times daily. Participants used video functions an average of 28 times. They chose video over written interventions on 67% of the times they used on-demand functions but opted for written content 78% of the times they responded to prescheduled prompts. Clinician videos were rated as more personal, engaging, and helpful than written interventions. Video and written interventions were rated as equally usable and understandable. Written interventions were rated as more favorable in letting users proceed at their own pace. Similarly to what is seen in live therapy, the communication style and demeanor of clinicians depicted in intervention videos reportedly affected participants’ experience with treatment. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Video-based mHealth may be a feasible, usable, acceptable, and highly engaging method for flexible delivery of interventions to people with schizophrenia using mobile technology. Producing intervention videos is more time-, labor-, and cost-intensive than generating written content, but participant feedback suggests that there may be added value in this approach. Additional research will determine whether video-based mHealth interventions lead to better, faster, or more sustainable clinical gains.

Method: A narrative review of published literature was conducted. Results: A complex adaptive systems perspective offers a framework and language that can assist individuals to make sense of their experiences and reconstruct their narratives during an often erratic and uncertain life transition. It is a novel research direction focused on a critical area of recovery and addresses the need for alternative approaches that embrace the complexities of health care.

"Journal Article","Job burnout in mental health providers: A meta-analysis of 35 years of intervention research.","Burnout is prevalent among mental health providers and is associated with significant employee, consumer, and organizational costs. Over the past 35 years, numerous intervention studies have been conducted but have yet to be reviewed and synthesized using a quantitative approach. To fill this gap, we performed a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of burnout interventions for mental health workers. We completed a systematic literature search of burnout intervention studies that spanned more than 3 decades (1980 to 2015). Each eligible study was independently coded by 2 researchers, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model with effect sizes based on the Hedges’ g statistic. We computed an overall intervention effect size and performed moderator analyses. Twenty-seven unique samples were included in the meta-analysis, representing 1,894 mental health workers. Interventions had a small but positive effect on provider burnout (Hedges’ g = .13, p = .006). Moderator analyses suggested that person-directed interventions were more effective than organization-directed interventions at reducing emotional exhaustion (Qbetween = 6.70, p = .010) and that job training/education was the most effective organizational intervention subtype (Qbetween = 12.50, p < .001). Lower baseline burnout levels were associated with smaller intervention effects and accounted for a significant proportion of effect size variability. The field has made limited progress in ameliorating mental health provider burnout. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers implement a wider breadth of interventions that are tailored to address unique organizational and staff needs and that incorporate longer follow-up periods.

"Journal Article","An online optimism intervention reduces depression in pessimistic individuals.","Objective: Interest in online positive psychology interventions (OPPIs) continues to grow. The empirical literature has identified design factors (e.g., variety and duration of activities) and moderators (e.g., personality traits) that can influence their effectiveness. A randomized controlled trial tested an empirically informed OPPI designed to promote self-efficacy and an optimistic outlook. Pessimism was included as a trait moderator. Method: Participants (N = 466) were English-speaking adults interested in becoming happier. They were randomly assigned to complete either an OPPI cultivating optimism or a control condition writing about daily activities for 3 weeks. Follow-up assessments occurred 1 and 2 months following the exercise period. Results: A hierarchical linear model analysis indicated that the optimism intervention increased the pursuit of engagement-related happiness in the short term and reduced dysfunctional attitudes across follow-ups. Pessimistic individuals had more to gain and reported fewer depressive symptoms at post-test. Conclusions: These findings support the conclusion that empirically informed online interventions can improve psychological well-being, at least in the short run, and may be particularly helpful when tailored to the needs of the individual.

"Journal Article","An experience sampling study examining the potential impact of a mindfulness-based intervention on emotion differentiation.","Research has shown that how well people can differentiate between different emotional states is an essential requirement for adaptive emotion regulation. People with low levels of emotion differentiation tend to be more vulnerable to develop emotional disorders. Although we know quite a lot about the correlates of emotion differentiation, research on factors or interventions which could improve emotion differentiation skills is scarce. Here, we hypothesize, and study empirically, whether a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) may impact the differentiation of negative and positive emotions. A within-subjects pre-, post-, and follow-up design involving experience sampling was used. At each phase participants reported their current emotions and mindfulness skills up to 40 times across 4 consecutive days using smartphones. Multilevel modeling showed a significant improvement in negative emotion differentiation postintervention and at 4 months of follow-up, and a significant improvement in positive emotion differentiation at 4 months follow-up. The improvement in negative emotion differentiation, however, was no longer significant when controlling for levels of negative affect. A time-lagged mediation model showed that posttreatment changes in mindfulness skills mediated subsequent changes in negative emotion differentiation, also when controlling for levels of negative affect. These results suggest that MBI is a promising approach to improve people’s emotion differentiation skills.

Recent empirical evidence suggests that SMART designs conducted within the context of a MOST framework can be used for building and optimizing AIs and may lead to better clinical care. SMART designs help optimize AIs by determining the best sequencing of decision rules. However, despite their growing relevance, MOSTs and SMARTs are relatively underutilized in the development of pediatric interventions. MOST and SMART designs can be used for developing efficient and cost-effective AIs. Intervention research within the field of pediatric psychology may benefit from incorporating these designs.

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that a brief measure incorporating local idioms of positive need fulfilment would predict functioning in a war-affected Sri Lankan population above and beyond psychopathology when controlling for demographic variables and current life stressors. A brief measure of positive need fulfillment was derived from qualitative data and administered to a sample of 163 Sri Lankans affected by the civil war. Positive need fulfillment was found to uniquely predict functioning after controlling for age, war-related life problems, and psychopathology as assessed by the Penn-RESIST-Peradeniya War Problems Questionnaire.

"Journal Article","Enhancing selective exposure to health messages and health intentions: Effects of susceptibility cues and gain–loss framing.","Insufficient message exposure is still a major obstacle for effective health communication activities, and little is known on how message features affect selective exposure and persuasion. This study examined the effects of two health message features, suggested susceptibility and gain–loss framing, on respondents’ selective exposure and subsequent health behavior intentions. Two personality traits, repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation, were studied as moderators of the proposed relationships. An experimental 2 (suggested susceptibility: low vs. high) × 2 (gain–loss framing: gain- vs. loss-framed message) study was conducted. Participants browsed through an online health magazine while their message choices were unobtrusively logged. A subsequent online questionnaire assessed personality dispositions and behavioral intentions. High levels of message susceptibility increased both selective exposure to health messages and respondents’ motivation to engage in adaptive health behaviors. Gain–loss framing did not affect message exposure or behavioral intentions, with one exception: Avoidance-oriented low-anxious respondents selected more loss-framed than gain-framed articles for reading. Repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation did not moderate health message effects, but partly influenced these measures directly or in combination. The number of articles to choose from was limited, and it is unclear to what extent the findings can be generalized to other, more familiar health topics. Emphasizing readers’ susceptibility to health threats appears very effective for increasing exposure to health messages and protective behavioral intentions. The effectiveness of gain–loss framing, by contrast, largely depends on moderating factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Hastall, Matthias R.;Wagner, Anna J.

"Journal Article","Extreme response style and symptom return after depression treatment: The role of positive extreme responding.","Objective: Evidence linking extreme response style (ER) to depressive relapse has been mixed. One reason might be high levels of extreme responses that are positive in nature (ER-Ps) compared with those negative in nature (ER-Ns) at posttreatment. ER-Ps likely consist of both maladaptive “style” responses and adaptive “content” responses (i.e., legitimate denials of dysfunction). The composition of ER-Ps might confound measures of total extreme responding as well as conventional scores on cognitive questionnaires. In the current study, we assessed ER in a new sample by (a) disambiguating ER-Ps that reflect style from those that reflect content and (b) assessing the contribution of ER-Ps to the prediction of relapse/recurrence. Method: Responders (N = 104) to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy versus medications for moderate to severe depression had an average age of 40 years (SD = 12), and they were 58% female, 38% married/cohabitating, and 85% Caucasian. ER variables were calculated using the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS; Weissman, 1979), with ER-Ps categorized as either content or style responses. ER indices and DAS scores were used to predict symptom return over 2 years. Results: No standard extreme responding variables (e.g., an index of total extreme responding) predicted symptom return, but higher relative levels of style ER-P predicted relapse/recurrence. Total DAS scores also predicted relapse/recurrence but only when high levels of style ER-P responses were controlled. Conclusions: ER-Ps, at least on the DAS, appear to contain indicators of both adaptive and maladaptive positive responses. Future research should attend to the valence of the extreme responses as well as to the content of extreme positive responses, which may reflect either healthy or unhealthy tendencies.

"Journal Article","Group parent–child interaction therapy: A randomized control trial for the treatment of conduct problems in young children.","Objective: Although efficacious interventions exist for childhood conduct problems, a majority of families in need of services do not receive them. To address problems of treatment access and adherence, innovative adaptations of current interventions are needed. This randomized control trial investigated the relative efficacy of a novel format of parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT), a treatment for young children with conduct problems. Method: Eighty-one families with 3- to 6-year-old children (71.6% boys, 85.2% White) with diagnoses of oppositional defiant or conduct disorder were randomized to individual PCIT (n = 42) or the novel format, Group PCIT. Parents completed standardized measures of children’s conduct problems, parenting stress, and social support at intake, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Therapist ratings, parent attendance, and homework completion provided measures of treatment adherence. Throughout treatment, parenting skills were assessed using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System. Results: Parents in both group and individual PCIT reported significant improvements from intake to posttreatment and follow-up in their children’s conduct problems and adaptive functioning, as well as significant decreases in parenting stress. Parents in both treatment conditions also showed significant improvements in their parenting skills. There were no interactions between time and treatment format. Contrary to expectation, parents in Group PCIT did not experience greater social support or treatment adherence. Conclusions: Group PCIT was not inferior to individual PCIT and may be a valuable format to reach more families in need of services. Future work should explore the efficiency and sustainability of Group PCIT in community settings.

"Journal Article","Emotional fitness and the movement of affective science from lab to field.","Emotions provide a ubiquitous and consequential backdrop to daily life, influencing everything from physiology to interpersonal relationships in the blink of an eye. Instances of emotional experience accumulate and compound to impact overall mental and physical health. Under optimal conditions, emotions are adaptive for the successful navigation of daily life. However, situational features of military life likely amplify everyday emotions and their impact, creating the need for soldiers to have a well-oiled emotional resilience system in place from the start, to be maintained throughout their careers. Basic research in affective science has identified the active ingredients that would be required in order for such a system of skills and abilities to have maximum impact on overall emotional fitness. Results of this emotional resilience training may provide compounding benefits for the individual as well as have spreading impact for the benefit of the military unit and other social connections.

"Journal Article","SMART longitudinal analysis: A tutorial for using repeated outcome measures from SMART studies to compare adaptive interventions.","In recent years, there has been increased interest in the development of adaptive interventions across various domains of health and psychological research. An adaptive intervention is a protocolized sequence of individualized treatments that seeks to address the unique and changing needs of individuals as they progress through an intervention program. The sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental study design that can be used to build the empirical basis for the construction of effective adaptive interventions. A SMART involves multiple stages of randomizations; each stage of randomization is designed to address scientific questions concerning the best intervention option to employ at that point in the intervention. Several adaptive interventions are embedded in a SMART by design; many SMARTs are motivated by scientific questions that concern the comparison of these embedded adaptive interventions. Until recently, analysis methods available for the comparison of adaptive interventions were limited to end-of-study outcomes. The current article provides an accessible and comprehensive tutorial to a new methodology for using repeated outcome data from SMART studies to compare adaptive interventions. We discuss how existing methods for comparing adaptive interventions in terms of end-of-study outcome data from a SMART can be extended for use with longitudinal outcome data. We also highlight the scientific utility of using longitudinal data from a SMART to compare adaptive interventions. A SMART study aiming to develop an adaptive intervention to engage alcohol- and cocaine-dependent individuals in treatment is used to demonstrate the application of this new methodology.

"Journal Article","A systematic review of psychological interventions for adolescents and young adults living with chronic illness.","Objective: There is increasing recognition that adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with chronic illnesses experience common psychological challenges. This article reviewed published psychological interventions for AYAs with cancer, diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sickle cell disease, and asthma. Common, efficacious intervention components were examined to generate clearer recommendations for future age-appropriate, evidence-based intervention development. Methods: Five databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process & Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL, were searched for studies involving AYAs aged 10–30 years, using quantitative two-group methods, published from 1979–2010. Of 1,233 abstracts, 87 were extracted for further analysis and a final 25 studies were eligible for inclusion. Thirteen of these studies included AYAs with diabetes, 7 studies involved AYAs with cancer, and 5 included AYAs with other illnesses. Results: Educational interventions showed some significant positive results, particularly when targeted knowledge outcomes were measured. Several skills-based programs, some including parents, showed positive results, with moderate effect sizes. Interventions which taught communication skills, incorporated practical components (e.g., role-plays, homework), involved ≥6 sessions, and spanned at least 3 months in length, appeared more likely to achieve positive outcomes. Conclusions: Skills-based interventions delivered over multiple sessions may yield the most positive results in AYAs with chronic illness. Given the few peer-support groups eligible for review, their efficacy remains unclear. This review points to the need for intervention development that teaches adaptive coping skills, is grounded in theoretical frameworks, and adheres to strict randomization and independent assessments to evaluate efficacy in assisting AYAs adjust to chronic illness.

"Journal Article","Etiology and treatment of post-cumulative traumatic stress disorders in different cultures.","Developments in the theories of identity, culture, and traumatology enrich our cross-cultural understanding of mental health dynamics, case conceptualization, and developing effective intervention models to help victims of complex and cumulative traumas especially in different cultures and minority populations. Identity traumas, along with preidentity and nonidentity traumas, contribute to forming cultures. On the other hand, cultures may contribute to delivering some types of culture- and social-made serious traumatic conditions that can be transferred cross-generationally, such as poverty and caste systems. Most current interventions are designed to help with single trauma and ignore the cumulative trauma dynamics as well the collective identity and culture-specific traumas. This understanding entails revising our culturally limited and single-trauma-based interventions to help clients who belong to different cultures or to minority victims of culture- and social-made traumas as well as those who are victims of cumulative traumas. Multisystemic, multimodal, multicomponent flexible and fiddle therapy models emerged as potentially more effective in the treatment of disorders resulting from cumulative and identity traumas. They are more ecologically valid and culturally competent. Specific models of multisystemic, multimodal therapies—the wraparound psychosocial rehabilitation approach, for torture survivors, and the summer day and after-school treatment, for child victims of cumulative traumas—are discussed.

"Journal Article","Consumer factors predicting level of treatment response to illness management and recovery.","Objective: This study aims to identify consumer-level predictors of level of treatment response to illness management and recovery (IMR) to target the appropriate consumers and aid psychiatric rehabilitation settings in developing intervention adaptations. Method: Secondary analyses from a multisite study of IMR were conducted. Self-report data from consumer participants of the parent study (n = 236) were analyzed for the current study. Consumers completed prepost surveys assessing illness management, coping, goal-related hope, social support, medication adherence, and working alliance. Correlations and multiple regression analyses were run to identify self-report variables that predicted level of treatment response to IMR. Results: Analyses revealed that goal-related hope significantly predicted level of improved illness self-management, F(1, 164) = 10.93, p < .001, R2 = .248, R2 change = .05. Additionally, we found that higher levels of maladaptive coping at baseline were predictive of higher levels of adaptive coping at follow-up, F(2, 180) = 5.29, p < .02, R2 = .38, R2 change = .02. Evidence did not support additional predictors. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Previously, consumer-level predictors of level of treatment response have not been explored for IMR. Although 2 significant predictors were identified, study findings suggest more work is needed. Future research is needed to identify additional consumer-level factors predictive of IMR treatment response in order to identify who would benefit most from this treatment program.

"Journal Article","Mediators of an Internet-based psychosocial intervention for women with breast cancer.","Objective: Many interventions have been designed to promote psychological adjustment in cancer survivors; however, notably few studies have specified the mediating processes through which these interventions work. The primary aim of this research is to examine theoretically and empirically grounded mediators of an Internet-based psychosocial intervention for women with breast cancer. Method: Women (N = 88) diagnosed with breast cancer were randomly assigned to participate in a 3-hr workshop for creation of personal websites or a waitlist control. Mediating variables and dependent variables were assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months following workshop participation. Indirect effects were tested using single and multiple mediator models. Results: Relative to control participants, women randomized to Project Connect Online (PCO) evidenced statistically significant benefit 6 months after the workshop on depressive symptoms, positive mood, and life appreciation, as well as on hypothesized mediators (i.e., coping self-confidence, loneliness, social support from friends, but not emotional processing and expression). Change over 6 months in coping self-confidence, loneliness, and social support from friends mediated the relationship between the intervention and improvement in depressive symptoms. Coping self-confidence mediated the relationship between PCO and enhanced positive mood, and social support from friends mediated the relationship between PCO and increased life appreciation. Conclusions: Findings indicate how PCO promoted adaptive change and highlighted modifiable factors, including coping self-confidence, loneliness, and social support from friends, which contributed to positive adjustment to breast cancer. Additional potential mediators and ways in which the intervention can be enhanced are addressed.

"Journal Article","Exploring the use of Sidekicks! For children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","Clinicians and educators are increasingly using technology within the context of existing therapies and teaching methodologies. The growing use of mobile clinical tools is particularly exciting for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as technologically based interventions have been shown to be both efficacious (to target academics, adaptive behavior, disruptive behavior, etc.) and accepted in this population (Odom et al., 2015). In addition, these tools have the potential to address two significant impediments in ASD intervention, the anxiety and/or skill deficits often associated with face-to-face interactions and skill generalization outside of the therapy office (Wieckowski & White, 2017). In other words, the use of technology may serve as an important preliminary or prerequisite step for face-to-face therapeutic progress. The purpose of this paper is to present a new, interactive clinical app that explicitly utilizes an individual’s restricted interests to teach skills and improve communication. The paper will briefly review the ways in which individuals with ASD may be good candidates for technological-based interventions, explore the current role of technology in existing evidence-based therapies, and discuss the use of a new technology, Sidekicks!, that has been developed for this population. A case example will then illustrate the use of Sidekicks! and its anticipated functionality across several public service settings, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and school systems, thereby coordinating the intervention efforts of various professionals involved in the treatment of children with ASD. Finally, limitations of the app (and of technology more generally) and the need for future research will be discussed.

"Journal Article","A salutogenic perspective on adverse experiences: The curvilinear relationship of adversity and well-being.","Research has predominantly focused on the negative effects of adversity on health and well-being. However, the salutogenic perspective suggests that adversity may not always be detrimental (Antonovsky, 1996). In fact, under certain circumstances, adversity may have the potential for positive outcomes, such as increased resilience and thriving (Carver, 1998; Rutter, 1987). The “steeling effect” suggests that past experiences of adversity may increase resistance to later adversities. It proposes that moderate adversity may facilitate more adaptive functioning than no adversity or high levels of adversity (Rutter, 2006, 2012). The relationship between adversity and health may be optimally assessed using curvilinear models, yet the majority of previous studies have examined linear associations (Masten & Cicchetti, 2016). It is therefore the aim of this review to determine whether moderate adversity is associated with more adaptive functioning when compared to no and high levels of adversity. Practical implications and future research are also discussed.

"Journal Article","LGBTQ relationally based positive psychology: An inclusive and systemic framework.","Positive psychologists have contributed to our understandings of how positive emotions and flexible cognition enhance resiliency. However, positive psychologists’ research has been slow to address the relational resources and interactions that help nonheterosexual families overcome adversity. Addressing overlooked lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) and systemic factors in positive psychology, this article draws on family resilience literature and LGBTQ literature to theorize a systemic positive psychology framework for working with nonheterosexual families. We developed the LGBTQ relationally based positive psychology framework that integrates positive psychology’s strengths-based perspective with the systemic orientation of Walsh’s (1996) family resilience framework along with the cultural considerations proposed by LGBTQ family literature. We theorize that the LGBTQ relationally based positive psychology framework takes into consideration the sociopolitical adversities impacting nonheterosexual families and sensitizes positive psychologists, including those working in organized care settings, to the systemic interactions of same-sex loving relationships.

"Journal Article","Dependency and self-criticism in treatments for depression.","Dependency and self-criticism are vulnerability factors for depression. How these personality factors change with treatment for depression and how they relate to symptom change across different types of treatment require further research. In addition, cultural differences that interact with the dependency/self-criticism–depression relation remain underinvestigated. We randomly assigned 149 adults with major depression to receive active medication (MED; n = 50), supportive–expressive therapy (SET; n = 49), or placebo pill (PBO; n = 50). Participants completed the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ; Blatt, D’Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976) before and after treatment and completed the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1967) throughout the course of treatment. Self-criticism as measured on the DEQ decreased with treatment similarly across conditions. DEQ Dependency decreased in MED but remained unchanged in SET and PBO. Higher initial dependency, but not higher initial self-criticism, predicted poor treatment response across conditions. Greater reduction in self-criticism was associated with greater reduction in depressive symptoms, but the effect was weaker for racial minorities (vs. White). Increase in connectedness, an adaptive form of dependency, was associated with symptom improvement in SET but not MED. Hence, different pathways of change seem to be implicated in the treatment of depression depending on culture and type of intervention. Implications for future research are discussed.

"Journal Article","Attention remediation following traumatic brain injury in childhood and adolescence.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently affects both the basic and the superordinate components of attention; deficits vary according to patient age. This study evaluated the efficacy of a specific remediation intervention for attention. Sixty-five TBI patients (aged 6?18 years) with attention deficit were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up: 40 patients received attention-specific neuropsychological training for 6 months, and the control group comprised 25 patients. Cognitive assessment included a Wechsler Intelligence Scale (e.g., A. Orsini, 1993) and the Continuous Performance Test II (CPT II; C. K. Conners, 2000). The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS; S. Sparrow, D. Balla & D. V. Cicchetti, 1984) was administered to assess the treatment's ecological validity. At baseline, all patients presented with a mild intellectual disability and pathological scores on the CPT II. At follow-up, significant differences were found between the 2 groups on the CPT II and VABS: The clinical group improved more than the control group. Specific remediation training for attention, including a combination of a process-specific approach and metacognitive strategies, significantly improved attention performance. Improvement in attention skills also affected adaptive skills positively.

Identifying modifiable factors related to mental health service utilization could facilitate development of interventions to increase utilization. The current study examined the relationship between mental health care utilization and measures of PTSD symptoms, resilience, stigma, beliefs about mental health care, perceived barriers to mental health care, posttraumatic growth and meaning, social support, and personality factors in a sample of 100 OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD symptoms referred to VA mental health care. Participants who received psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (PP) scored higher on measures of PTSD symptoms, stigma, and adaptive beliefs about mental health treatment, and lower on measures of resilience, postdeployment social support, emotional stability, and conscientiousness, than participants who received no treatment (NT). Participants who received psychotherapy only (PT) scored higher on a measure of PTSD symptoms than NT participants. PT participants scored higher on an emotional stability measure and lower on measures of PTSD symptoms and stigma than PP participants. Multinomial logistic regression including all variables significantly related to treatment utilization indicated that PTSD symptoms and adaptive beliefs about psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy were higher in the PT and PP groups than in the NT group, and concerns about discrimination were higher in the PP group than the NT group. Interventions targeting beliefs about mental health care could increase mental health treatment utilization among OEF/OIF/OND veterans. Concerns about stigma may affect the utilization process differently at different decision points.

"Journal Article","Preliminary results for an adaptive family treatment for drug abuse in Hispanic youth.","A small randomized trial investigated a new family-based intervention for Hispanic adolescents who met DSM–IV criteria for substance abuse disorder. The Culturally Informed and Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) is a tailored/adaptive intervention that includes a flexible treatment manual and multiple treatment components. The study used an “add on” design to isolate the effects on substance abuse, behavior problems, and parenting practices attributable to the newly developed components. Twenty-eight Hispanic adolescents and their families were randomized either to the experimental treatment or to traditional family therapy (TFT) and were assessed at baseline and 8-month follow-up. Despite the small sample, results revealed statistically significant time × treatment effects on both self-reported drug use (marijuana + cocaine), F(1, 22) = 10.59, p < .01, η² = .33 and adolescent reports of parenting practices, F(1, 22) = 9.01, p < .01, η² = .29. Both sets of analyses favored CIFFTA participants. There was a significant time × treatment effect, F(1, 22) = 6.72, p = .02, η² = .23, favoring CIFFTA on parent report of parenting practices using a composite that matched the variables used for adolescents, but only a nonsignificant trend, F(1, 22) = 2.43, p = .13, η² = .10, with a composite that used all parenting subscales. Parent reports of adolescent behavior problems did not show a significant time or time × treatment effect. These results show the promise of this adaptive treatment for substance abuse in Hispanic adolescents and suggest the need for a larger randomized trial to fully investigate this treatment.

"Journal Article","The mechanisms of far transfer from cognitive training: Review and hypothesis.","Objective: General intelligence is important for success in daily life, fueling interest in developing cognitive training as an intervention to improve fluid ability (Gf). A major obstacle to the design of effective cognitive interventions has been the paucity of hypotheses bearing on mechanisms underlying transfer of cognitive training to Gf. Despite the large amounts of money and time currently being expended on cognitive training, there is little scientific agreement on how, or even whether, Gf can be heightened by such training. Method: We review the relevant strands of evidence on cognitive-training-related changes in (a) cortical mechanisms of distraction suppression, and (b) activation of the dorsal attention network (DAN). We hypothesize that training-related increases in control of attention are important for what is termed far transfer of cognitive training to untrained abilities, notably to Gf. Results: We review the evidence that distraction suppression evident in behavior, neuronal firing, scalp electroencephalography, and hemodynamic change is important for protecting target processing during perception and also for protecting targets held in working memory. Importantly, attentional control also appears to be central to performance on Gf assessments. Consistent with this evidence, forms of cognitive training that increase ability to ignore distractions (e.g., working memory training and perceptual training) not only affect the DAN but also affect transfer to Gf. Conclusions: Our hypothesis is supported by existing evidence. However, to advance the field of cognitive training, it is necessary that competing hypotheses on mechanisms of far transfer of cognitive training be advanced and empirically tested.

They also reported their level of career decidedness and decisional anxiety at both of these time points as well as near the end of the academic year (about 3 months after the 2nd assessment). The model provided good overall fit to the data and accounted for substantial portions of the variance in engagement in exploratory actions and in the 2 decisional outcomes (decidedness and decisional anxiety) over time. The findings also supported the hypothesized bidirectional paths of the decisional outcomes to self-efficacy and outcome expectations. We consider implications of the findings for the social–cognitive model as well as for future research and practice.

Method: Veteran peer specialists were trained to deliver sessions focusing on mental health and substance use recovery to veterans for an intended 1-hr weekly contact over 9 months. Trajectories of peer engagement over the study’s duration are summarized. A mixed-effects log-linear model of the rate of peer engagement is tested with three sets of covariates representing characteristics of the veterans. These sets were demographics, mental health and substance use status, and indicators of community participation and support. Results: Data indicate that veterans engaged with peers about once per month rather than the intended once per week. However, frequency of contacts varied greatly. The best predictor of engagement was time, with most contacts occurring within the first 6 months. No other veteran characteristic was a statistically significant predictor of engagement. Older veterans tended to have higher rates of engagement with peer supporters. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Planners of peer support services could consider yardsticks of monthly services up to 6 months. Peer support services need a flexible strategy with varying levels of intensity according to need. Peer support services will need to be tailored to better engage younger veterans. Future research should consider other sources of variation in engagement with peer support such as characteristics of the peer supporters and service content and setting.

"Journal Article","A systematic review of evaluated suicide prevention programs targeting indigenous youth.","Background: Indigenous young people have significantly higher suicide rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. There is a need for culturally appropriate and effective suicide prevention programs for this demographic. Aims: This review assesses suicide prevention programs that have been evaluated for indigenous youth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Method: The databases MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for publications on suicide prevention programs targeting indigenous youth that include reports on evaluations and outcomes. Program content, indigenous involvement, evaluation design, program implementation, and outcomes were assessed for each article. Results: The search yielded 229 articles; 90 abstracts were assessed, and 11 articles describing nine programs were reviewed. Two Australian programs and seven American programs were included. Programs were culturally tailored, flexible, and incorporated multiple-levels of prevention. No randomized controlled trials were found, and many programs employed ad hoc evaluations, poor program description, and no process evaluation. Conclusion: Despite culturally appropriate content, the results of the review indicate that more controlled study designs using planned evaluations and valid outcome measures are needed in research on indigenous youth suicide prevention. Such changes may positively influence the future of research on indigenous youth suicide prevention as the outcomes and efficacy will be more reliable.

"Journal Article","The SENSE study: Post intervention effects of a randomized controlled trial of a cognitive–behavioral and mindfulness-based group sleep improvement intervention among at-risk adolescents.","Objective: Sleep problems are a major risk factor for the emergence of mental health problems in adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the post intervention effects of a cognitive–behavioral/mindfulness-based group sleep intervention on sleep and mental health among at-risk adolescents. Method: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted across High schools in Melbourne, Australia. One hundred forty-four adolescents (aged 12–17 years) with high levels of anxiety and sleeping difficulties, but without past or current depressive disorder, were randomized into either a sleep improvement intervention or an active control ‘study skills’ intervention. Both programs consisted of 7 90-min-long group sessions delivered over 7 weeks. One hundred twenty-three participants began the interventions (female = 60%; mean age = 14.48, SD = 0.95), with 60 in the sleep condition and 63 in the control condition. All participants were required to complete a battery of mood and sleep questionnaires, 7 days of wrist actigraphy (an objective measure of sleep), and sleep diary entry at pre- and-post intervention. Results: The sleep intervention condition was associated with significantly greater improvements in subjective sleep (global sleep quality [with a medium effect size], sleep onset latency, daytime sleepiness [with small effect sizes]), objective sleep (sleep onset latency [with a medium effect size]), and anxiety (with a small effect size) compared with the control intervention condition. Conclusion: The SENSE study provides evidence that a multicomponent group sleep intervention that includes cognitive–behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies can reduce sleep initiation problems and related daytime dysfunction, along with concomitant anxiety symptoms, among at-risk adolescents.

"Journal Article","A naturalistic study of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified patients treated by community clinicians.","[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 1(3) of Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy (see record 2009-18612-003). Author Ruth Lanius’s name was misspelled as Ruth Lanins; author Scot McNary’s name was misspelled Scott McNary; author Clare Pain’s name was misspelled Claire Pain; and the affiliation for Richard Loewenstein should have read Sheppard Pratt Health System.] The goals of this naturalistic, cross-sectional study were to describe the patient, therapist, and therapeutic conditions of an international sample of dissociative disorder (DD) patients treated by community therapists and to determine if community treatment for DD appears to be as effective as treatment for chronic PTSD and conditions comorbid with DD. Analyses found that across both patient (N = 280) and therapist (N = 292) reports, patients in the later stages of treatment engaged in fewer self-injurious behaviors, had fewer hospitalizations, and showed higher levels of various measures of adaptive functioning (e.g., GAF) than those in the initial stage of treatment. Additionally, patients in the later stages of treatment reported lower symptoms of dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder, and distress than patients in the initial stage of treatment. The effect sizes for Stage 5 versus Stage 1 differences in DD treatment were comparable to those published for chronic PTSD associated with childhood trauma and depression comorbid with borderline personality disorder. Given the prevalence, severity, chronicity, and high health care costs associated with DD, these results suggest that extended treatment for DD may be beneficial and merits further research.

"Journal Article","The clinical utility of personality subtypes in patients with anorexia nervosa.","Objective: Elucidation of clinically relevant subtypes has been proposed as a means of advancing treatment research, but classifying anorexia nervosa (AN) patients into restricting and binge-eating/purging types has demonstrated limited predictive validity. This study aimed to evaluate whether an approach to classifying eating disorder patients on the basis of comorbid personality psychopathology has utility in predicting treatment response and readmission in patients with AN. Method: Data were collected from 154 AN patients (M [SD] age = 25.6[9.4] years; 95.5% female; 96.8% Caucasian) at admission, discharge, and 3 months postdischarge from intensive treatment. Latent profile analysis of personality traits assessed at admission was performed to classify participants into personality subtypes, which were then used to predict outcomes at discharge and risk of readmission. Results: The best fitting model identified 3 personality subtypes (undercontrolled, overcontrolled, low psychopathology) that contributed significantly to multivariate models predicting study outcomes. Undercontrolled patients were more likely to have a poor outcome at discharge than overcontrolled (OR = 3.56, p = .01) and low psychopathology patients (OR = 11.23, p < .001). Undercontrolled patients also had a greater risk of discharge against medical advice (HR = 2.08, p = .02) and readmission than overcontrolled patients (HR = 3.76, p = .009). Binge-eating/purging versus restricting subtypes did not predict discharge against medical advice or readmission in the multivariate models. Conclusions: Findings support the clinical utility of personality subtypes in AN. Future work is needed to identify mechanisms that explain diminished treatment response in undercontrolled patients and to develop interventions for this high-risk group.

"Journal Article","A randomized, controlled trial of the family check-up model in public secondary schools: Examining links between parent engagement and substance use progressions from early adolescence to adulthood.","Objective: Substance use in adulthood compromises work, relationships, and health. Prevention strategies in early adolescence are designed to reduce substance use and progressions to problematic use by adulthood. This report examines the long-term effects of offering Family Check-up (FCU) at multiple time points in secondary education on the progression of substance use from age 11 to 23 years. Method: Participants (N = 998; 472 females) were randomly assigned individuals to intervention or control in Grade 6 and offered a multilevel intervention that included a classroom-based intervention (universal), the FCU (selected), and tailored family management treatment (indicated). Among intervention families, 23% engaged in the selected and indicated levels during middle school. Results: Intention to treat analyses revealed that randomization to the FCU was associated with reduced growth in marijuana use (p < .05), but not alcohol and tobacco use. We also examined whether engagement in the voluntary FCU services moderated the effect of the intervention on substance use progressions using complier average causal effect (CACE) modeling, and found that engagement in the FCU services predicted reductions in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use by age 23. In comparing engagers with nonengagers: 70% versus 95% showed signs of alcohol abuse or dependence, 28% versus 61% showed signs of tobacco dependence, and 59% versus 84% showed signs of marijuana abuse or dependence. Conclusion: Family interventions that are embedded within public school systems can reach high-risk students and families and prevent progressions from exploration to problematic substance use through early adulthood.
