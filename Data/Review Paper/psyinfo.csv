"Journal Article","Psychological and relational health profiles of soldiers in committed romantic relationships.","The present study explored the heterogeneity of military service members’ psychological and relational functioning using a sample of 7,866 soldiers in committed romantic relationships from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members (Army STARRS). A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify and predict unique clusters of soldiers’ relative psychological (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety symptom severity) and relational (i.e., relationship happiness, how often their relationship was going well, how often they confided in their partner, how often they considered or discussed ending their relationship, relational insecurity, and relational turbulence) functioning. Results revealed 4 distinct classes of comparative psychological and relational health: hardy soldiers and healthy relaters (70.2%), stressed soldiers but healthy relaters (13.1%), hardy soldiers but strained relaters (12.7%), and stressed soldiers and strained relaters (4.0%). Class descriptions, as well as implications for theory and clinical practice are reviewed. Notably, 7 out of 10 soldiers in this nationally representative sample reported little to no psychological or relational distress. These findings invite more adaptive narratives of service member resilience and a more nuanced conceptualization of gradations in psychological and relational functioning.

"Journal Article","How cohabitation, marriage, separation, and divorce influence BMI: A prospective panel study.","Objective: This study examines how changes in cohabitation or marital status affect Body Mass Index (BMI) over time in a large representative sample. Method: Participants were 20,950 individuals (50% female; 19 to 100 years), representative of the German population, who provided 81,926 observations over 16 years. Face-to-face interviews were used to obtain demographic data, including cohabitation and marital status, height, body weight, and weight-relevant behaviors (exercise, healthy eating, and smoking). Control variables included age, notable changes in status (life events such as having children or change in employment status), perceived stress, and subjective health. Results: Cohabitation led to significant weight gain in men and women—after four years or longer, about twice the gain associated with marriage (controlling for weight-related behaviors, age, children, employment, stress, and health). BMI after separation was largely comparable to BMI before starting cohabitation; women lost some weight in the first year, men gained some weight after four or more years of separation. Divorce generally predicted weight gain. Changes in exercise, healthy eating, and smoking did not attenuate the effect of changes in relationship status on BMI. Conclusions: This is among the first longitudinal studies to directly compare the effects of key changes in relationship status on BMI. The findings extend and qualify previous results by showing that the benefits of marriage or cohabitation do not necessarily include a healthier BMI. They also suggest that relationship transitions—particularly moving in with a partner and divorce—may be important time windows for weight gain prevention.

"Journal Article","Immediate and long-term efficacy of executive functions cognitive training in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","There has been growing interest in enhancing cognition in older adulthood via computerized cognitive training (CCT), though, there is controversy surrounding the efficacy of CCT in promoting improvements to functional everyday activities. As core executive-functions (EFs)—cognitive-flexibility, inhibition, working memory—are applicable to most aspects of daily living, CCT targeting these processes would likely promote gains on trained tasks, and potentially on similar untrained tasks (near-transfer), and general cognitive performance (far-transfer). We report two meta-analyses investigating the immediate (pretest to posttest) and long-term efficacy (pretest to follow-up) of core-EF CCT in improving cognition among older adults. Sixty-four studies (encompassing 3,594 participants) included an eligible CCT intervention targeting at least 1 core-EF (e.g., working memory training). Both immediate and long-term efficacy analyses revealed significant, large training effects for trained outcomes, and significant, small training effects for near-transfer and far-transfer outcomes. When comparing the same studies, effect sizes from immediate and long-term efficacy analyses were comparable, suggesting that CCT gains were maintained over time. Further analyses of immediate efficacy revealed significant, small training effects for performance on executive functioning, fluid intelligence, memory, and visuospatial domains, but not for attention or processing speed. After adjusting for publication bias, the training effect for fluid intelligence was nonsignificant, whereas processing speed was significant. It is recommended that future studies employ adaptive multidomain training as these studies were shown to produce significant training effects at each transfer level. Overall, core-EF CCT interventions show promise in promoting immediate and long-term improvements in cognitive performance among older adults.

"Journal Article","Acculturative stress and coping strategies among Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong: A qualitative inquiry.","Despite the growing population of Mainland Chinese students at the local government-funded universities in Hong Kong, little is known about their acculturation experiences and psychosocial adjustment. Drawing on an acculturation framework (Berry, 2003) and theories of coping (Folkman, 1984), resilience (Masten, 2001), and socioecological processes (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), this article provides an in-depth account of acculturative stress and coping behaviors experienced by Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong. Using qualitative research methods, we conducted seven focus groups with a total of 32 Mainland Chinese students from a public university in Hong Kong over a 3-month period. Analytic strategy included identifying the unit of analysis, coding, sorting code, checking code, and creating salient themes. Findings suggested that Mainland Chinese university students faced acculturative stress stemming from “language barriers,” “prejudice and discrimination,” “cultural differences,” and “transport, food, and accommodation.” The study also found that the participants used a number of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies in the face of acculturative stress. As an extension of this research, future studies should examine the subtle difference between a subculture (Hong Kong) and its mother culture (Mainland China) and how that affects acculturative stress. Implications of these findings are discussed at the levels of theory, policy, and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Bhowmik, Miron Kumar;Cheung, Rebecca Y.

"Journal Article","Youth-serving institutional resources and neighborhood safety: Ties with positive youth development.","Neighborhoods are critical contexts for adolescent development, but little attention has been paid to how neighborhood characteristics play a role in positive youth development (PYD), notably among predominantly African American youth. This study examined distinct features of the neighborhood, including youth-serving institutional resources (YSI) and safety, as they relate to PYD among adolescents from low-income neighborhoods in an urban setting (n = 491, 68.6% African American). Because neighborhood experiences during adolescence often differ based on gender, we also examined moderation by gender. Results from cross-sectional, multilevel data suggest that neighborhood safety, YSIs, and gender are differentially associated with indicators of PYD (i.e., hope, mastery, friend support). The pattern of results suggested that when associated with mastery, YSIs may compensate for low-safety neighborhoods for adolescent females but not males. In terms of associations with friend support, YSIs may foster the development of PYD in low-safety neighborhoods for males but not females. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed.

"Journal Article","A pilot study of a family cognitive adaptation training guide for individuals with schizophrenia.","Objective: There is a paucity of accessible, evidence-based tools for caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia. This study examines changes in the self-assessed and caregiver-assessed outcomes of people with schizophrenia after exposure to a cognitive adaptation training (CAT) guide that addressed pragmatic, in-home approaches to offset the cognitive impacts of the illness. Method: This study examined the 4-month, pre–post outcomes of a CAT guide, as compared with a popular, general manual, for families of individuals with schizophrenia. A total of 17 caregiver-supported individual dyads completed all measures, having been randomized to either a CAT-guide group or a support-manual group. Measures included medication adherence, adaptive functioning, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Semistructured interviews assessed use and utility questions. Results: Caregiver-assessed improvements in community functioning with medium–high effect sizes were observed in both study conditions. Self-report ratings by supported individuals did not change from baseline to 4 months and no change was observed in medication adherence or quality of life for either condition. Caregiver-burden ratings significantly declined with a large effect size, again with no difference as a function of manual type. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: These findings suggest that there is some promise in providing families with evidence-based information in manual form. Further research informed by this study’s findings should include assessments of whether and how environmental cognitive supports can be of specific benefit to families affected by schizophrenia.

"Journal Article","A review and meta-analysis of perfectionism interventions: Comparing face-to-face with online modalities.","Extending Lloyd, Schmidt, Khondoker, and Tchanturia (2015), this review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of randomized controlled trials aimed at reducing perfectionism and associated symptoms of depression and anxiety. Of particular interest was the examination of a moderator of delivery method (face-to-face vs. online) in testing the effectiveness of psychological interventions. Also examined is the effect of two structural moderators (control condition type, sample characteristic). A total of 10 studies were identified (65 perfectionism effect sizes, 8 depression effect sizes, and 8 anxiety effect sizes). Psychological interventions were effective in decreasing perfectionism dimensions, depression, and anxiety with medium effect sizes. There were no significant differences in delivery modality, control condition type, and sample characteristic on effect sizes. Findings suggest that psychological interventions are generally effective in reducing perfectionism, although there is no apparent delineation in increasing “adaptive” perfectionism and decreasing “maladaptive” perfectionism. Although comparable benefits were shown in face-to-face and online intervention delivery modes, we suggest prudently incorporating online interventions into clinical practice.

"Journal Article","Best practices and recommendations for digital interventions to improve engagement and adherence in chronic illness sufferers.","Chronic illnesses cause considerable burden in quality of life, often leading to physical, psychological, and social dysfunctioning of the sufferers and their family. There is a growing need for flexible provision of home-based psychological services to increase reach even for traditionally underserved chronic illness sufferer populations. Digital interventions can fulfill this role and provide a range of psychological services to improve functioning. Despite the potential of digital interventions, concerns remain regarding users’ engagement, as low engagement is associated with low adherence rates, high attrition, and suboptimal exposure to the intervention. Human–computer interaction (e.g., theoretical models of persuasive system design, gamification, tailoring, and supportive accountability) and user characteristics (e.g., gender, age, computer literacy) are the main identified culprits contributing to engagement and adherence difficulties. To date, there have not been any clear and concise recommendations for improved utilization and engagement in digital interventions. This paper provides an overview of user engagement factors and proposes research informed recommendations for engagement and adherence planning in digital intervention development. The recommendations were derived from the literature and consensualized by expert members of the European Federation of Psychology Associations, Psychology and Health Standing Committee, and e-Health Task Force. These recommendations serve as a starting point for researchers and clinicians interested in the digitalized health field and promote effective planning for engagement when developing digital interventions with the potential to maximize adherence and optimal exposure in the treatment of chronic health conditions.

"Journal Article","A stepped care approach to clinical suicide prevention.","Despite the enormous humanitarian and economic toll of suicide, mental health systems of care are largely underprepared to work effectively with suicidal individuals and suicide is a leading “Sentinel Event” in U.S. health care settings (The Joint Commission, 2016). In response to these concerns, a recent policy initiative called “Zero Suicide” has advocated a systems-level response to the suicidal risk within health care and this policy initiative is yielding positive results (Hogan & Goldstein Grumet, 2016). Along these lines, a “stepped care” approach developed by Jobes (2016) has been adapted and used within the Zero Suicide curriculum as a model for systems-level care that is suicide-specific, evidence-based, least-restrictive, and cost-effective. The Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is an example of one suicide-specific evidence-based clinical intervention that can be adapted and used across the full range of stepped care service settings (Jobes, 2016). This article describes various applications and uses of CAMS at all service levels and highlights CAMS-related innovations. It is argued that psychological services are uniquely poised to make a major difference in clinical suicide prevention through a systems-level approach using evidence-based care such as CAMS.

"Journal Article","PTSD as a moderator of a parenting intervention for military families.","The stress of multiple deployments and exposure to combat places service members at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may detrimentally affect parenting. Evidence-based parenting programs have been successful in promoting adaptive parenting practices among families exposed to stress. However, the effects of preventive interventions on parenting may vary by military parent’s PTSD. The current study includes families who participated in a randomized controlled trial of a parenting intervention for military families known as After Deployment, Adaptive Parenting Tools (ADAPT). Families were randomized to either a 14-week, group-based parenting program or a comparison group. Participants included families with 4- to 12-year-old children in which at least 1 parent deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan (N = 336; 945 individuals). Structural equation modeling was used to examine parent self-reported PTSD as a potential moderator of the relationship between intent-to-treat status and effective parenting practices 12 months postbaseline while accounting for baseline effective parenting, length and number of deployments, and family demographics. Father PTSD was a significant moderator, such that the intervention was less effective for fathers who met clinical levels of PTSD. No significant moderation effects were found among mothers. These findings may have important implications for the development of future evidence-based parenting programs.

"Journal Article","Sociodemographic outcomes from an urban pediatric obesity program.","Objective: Pediatric weight management programs are plagued by insufficient changes in standardized body mass index (zBMI), disproportionately impacting racial minorities. Treatment outcomes of a pediatric weight management program with a large and diverse baseline sample were evaluated. Demographic and socioeconomic predictors of change in zBMI after 1 year were examined separately to identify characteristics contributing to treatment outcomes. It was hypothesized that socioeconomic disparities would account for lower zBMI outcomes above and beyond demographic factors. Method: Data were collected from 1,784 youth at baseline (n = 271 at 12 months; age M = 11.89 years, SD = 3.15). Information on zBMI, demographics (sex, race, age, mother’s body mass index [BMI]) and socioeconomic status (SES; health insurance, number parents in home) were collected at baseline and 12 months post intervention. Results: After 1 year, average change in zBMI was −0.12 (SD = 0.21). Linear hierarchical regression analysis assessed if SES factors predicted change in zBMI after 12 months above and beyond demographic factors. Demographics were entered in Block 1, and SES factors in Block 2. The final model significantly accounted for 14.2% of variance in change in zBMI (p < .000). Examining blocks separately indicated SES variables did not significantly add to the model beyond demographic variables, contributing to less than 1.0% of the variance. Unique predictors included age, and mother’s BMI. Conclusions: Participation in the program was associated with decreases in zBMI for youth who completed the year of treatment and follow-ups. Factors related to age and family had the largest association with weight loss. SES factors were not related to change in zBMI beyond demographic factors.

"Journal Article","An investigation of the influence of case and clinician gender in clinical decision-making.","The present study was intended to assess the reliability of clinician judgments, with a particular interest in how such judgments vary by the gender of the case vignette and clinician. A national sample of 123 mental health professionals (57.7% male) provided clinical judgments on 12 case vignettes primarily representing personality pathology; two identical versions of each vignette were prepared, with the only difference being the use of masculine or feminine pronouns identifying the client. Clinical judgments included evaluations of adaptive functioning, long-term prognostic assessments, short-term risk evaluations, and treatment recommendations. Analyses included intraclass correlations between clinicians to assess reliability, as well as an examination of the variance of clinical judgments as a function of the identified gender of the case and the gender of the participating clinician. No significant two-way interactions were found between case gender and clinician gender in predicting the clinical judgments. A significant main effect of case gender in predicting vocational functioning was observed, such that female cases were rated as having better estimated vocational functioning than male cases. In addition, a significant main effect of clinician gender in predicting aggression and violence risk was found, such that ratings by female clinicians were higher than ratings by male clinicians. Results offer little if any evidence to suggest the influence of client or clinician gender on the majority of clinical judgments made in the present study. However, these results bear replication, particularly in light of the two significant main effects that did emerge.

Method: Patients were randomized to a CBSM group intervention (n = 95) or a health promotion (HP) attention-matched control condition (n = 97). Participants attended all sessions via video conference using tablets, and completed PROMIS® computer adaptive tests (CATs) assessing anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and physical function weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Assessment completion rates >50% at week 1 and week 10 demonstrated moderate feasibility of repeatedly administering PROMIS® CATs using a web-based method. Multilevel modeling demonstrated no significant group-by-time interactions from week 1 to week 10 for any of the assessed PROMIS® domains adjusting for sociodemographic and medical covariates. However, simple effects demonstrated decreases in PROMIS® anxiety scores from week 1 to 10 for both groups. Results also demonstrated significant relationships of medical variables to psychosocial functioning across time points. Conclusions: Results highlight the feasibility and benefits of utilizing PROMIS® CATs to repeatedly assess psychosocial functioning using a web-based method and indicate that web-based interventions may be effective for decreasing psychosocial distress and adverse symptoms among men with APC undergoing hormone therapy.

Throughout 10 years of data collection, Palestinian-Arab culture and Islamic faith have consistently emerged as important factors that can be considered when interpreting this participant’s general level of autonomy, medical autonomy, medical adherence, and psychological adjustment. This case study examines important aspects of adaptive and independent functioning for youth with spina bifida and how this family’s culture interacts with these different domains of functioning. In order to fully capture this family’s distinct lived experience, this case study reviews both quantitative data and qualitative data, highlighting the importance of considering context when performing clinical research.

"Journal Article","Discrimination, segregation, and chronic inflammation: Testing the weathering explanation for the poor health of Black Americans.","Several studies have reported a relation between race-related stressors and the poor health of Black Americans. Such findings raise questions regarding the mediating biological mechanisms that might account for this link. The present study investigated elevated systemic inflammation, a factor shown to be a strong predictor of chronic illness and mortality in all ethnic populations, as a possible factor. Using 7 waves of data from the Family and Community Health Study, collected over a 20-year period from over 400 Black Americans, we investigated the extent to which exposure to discrimination and segregation at various points in the life course predicted adult inflammation at age 28. Our analyses examined whether cumulative stress, stress generation, or predictive adaptive response (PAR) models best accounted for any associations that existed between these race-related stressors and adult inflammation. At every wave of data collection, assessments of discrimination and segregation were related to adult inflammation. However, multivariate analyses using structure equation modeling indicated that the PAR model best explained the effect of these race-related stressors on inflammation. Exposure to discrimination and segregation during the juvenile years predicted adult inflammation and amplified the inflammatory effect of adult exposure to these race-related stressors. These effects were considerably more robust than that of traditional health risk factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and low SES. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the limitations of the widely accepted risk factor approach to increasing the health of Black Americans.

"Journal Article","Video-based mobile health interventions for people with schizophrenia: Bringing the “pocket therapist” to life.","Objective: To examine whether video-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions are feasible, acceptable, understandable, and engaging to people with schizophrenia. Method: This study used a mixed-methods design. Ten individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited for a month-long trial in which they used FOCUS-Audio/Video (FOCUS–AV), a smartphone system that offers video and written intervention options. Participants completed posttrial measures and engaged in semistructured interviews. Findings: One participant dropped out. The remaining 9 participants used intervention videos successfully. Participants responded to 67% of system-delivered prompts to engage FOCUS–AV, and 52% of FOCUS–AV use was initiated by the users. On average, participants used interventions 6 days a week, 4 times daily. Participants used video functions an average of 28 times. They chose video over written interventions on 67% of the times they used on-demand functions but opted for written content 78% of the times they responded to prescheduled prompts. Clinician videos were rated as more personal, engaging, and helpful than written interventions. Video and written interventions were rated as equally usable and understandable. Written interventions were rated as more favorable in letting users proceed at their own pace. Similarly to what is seen in live therapy, the communication style and demeanor of clinicians depicted in intervention videos reportedly affected participants’ experience with treatment. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Video-based mHealth may be a feasible, usable, acceptable, and highly engaging method for flexible delivery of interventions to people with schizophrenia using mobile technology. Producing intervention videos is more time-, labor-, and cost-intensive than generating written content, but participant feedback suggests that there may be added value in this approach. Additional research will determine whether video-based mHealth interventions lead to better, faster, or more sustainable clinical gains.

"Journal Article","Job burnout in mental health providers: A meta-analysis of 35 years of intervention research.","Burnout is prevalent among mental health providers and is associated with significant employee, consumer, and organizational costs. Over the past 35 years, numerous intervention studies have been conducted but have yet to be reviewed and synthesized using a quantitative approach. To fill this gap, we performed a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of burnout interventions for mental health workers. We completed a systematic literature search of burnout intervention studies that spanned more than 3 decades (1980 to 2015). Each eligible study was independently coded by 2 researchers, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model with effect sizes based on the Hedges’ g statistic. We computed an overall intervention effect size and performed moderator analyses. Twenty-seven unique samples were included in the meta-analysis, representing 1,894 mental health workers. Interventions had a small but positive effect on provider burnout (Hedges’ g = .13, p = .006). Moderator analyses suggested that person-directed interventions were more effective than organization-directed interventions at reducing emotional exhaustion (Qbetween = 6.70, p = .010) and that job training/education was the most effective organizational intervention subtype (Qbetween = 12.50, p < .001). Lower baseline burnout levels were associated with smaller intervention effects and accounted for a significant proportion of effect size variability. The field has made limited progress in ameliorating mental health provider burnout. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers implement a wider breadth of interventions that are tailored to address unique organizational and staff needs and that incorporate longer follow-up periods.

"Journal Article","An experience sampling study examining the potential impact of a mindfulness-based intervention on emotion differentiation.","Research has shown that how well people can differentiate between different emotional states is an essential requirement for adaptive emotion regulation. People with low levels of emotion differentiation tend to be more vulnerable to develop emotional disorders. Although we know quite a lot about the correlates of emotion differentiation, research on factors or interventions which could improve emotion differentiation skills is scarce. Here, we hypothesize, and study empirically, whether a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) may impact the differentiation of negative and positive emotions. A within-subjects pre-, post-, and follow-up design involving experience sampling was used. At each phase participants reported their current emotions and mindfulness skills up to 40 times across 4 consecutive days using smartphones. Multilevel modeling showed a significant improvement in negative emotion differentiation postintervention and at 4 months of follow-up, and a significant improvement in positive emotion differentiation at 4 months follow-up. The improvement in negative emotion differentiation, however, was no longer significant when controlling for levels of negative affect. A time-lagged mediation model showed that posttreatment changes in mindfulness skills mediated subsequent changes in negative emotion differentiation, also when controlling for levels of negative affect. These results suggest that MBI is a promising approach to improve people’s emotion differentiation skills.

"Journal Article","The importance of positive need fulfillment: Evidence from a sample of war-affected Sri Lankans.","There has been growing interest in understanding the psychological and social-environmental factors that facilitate adaptive functioning in populations affected by ethnopolitical warfare. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that a brief measure incorporating local idioms of positive need fulfilment would predict functioning in a war-affected Sri Lankan population above and beyond psychopathology when controlling for demographic variables and current life stressors. A brief measure of positive need fulfillment was derived from qualitative data and administered to a sample of 163 Sri Lankans affected by the civil war. Positive need fulfillment was found to uniquely predict functioning after controlling for age, war-related life problems, and psychopathology as assessed by the Penn-RESIST-Peradeniya War Problems Questionnaire. These findings highlight the importance of both basic need support and the fostering of agency in addition to addressing mental health needs.

"Journal Article","Enhancing selective exposure to health messages and health intentions: Effects of susceptibility cues and gain–loss framing.","Insufficient message exposure is still a major obstacle for effective health communication activities, and little is known on how message features affect selective exposure and persuasion. This study examined the effects of two health message features, suggested susceptibility and gain–loss framing, on respondents’ selective exposure and subsequent health behavior intentions. Two personality traits, repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation, were studied as moderators of the proposed relationships. An experimental 2 (suggested susceptibility: low vs. high) × 2 (gain–loss framing: gain- vs. loss-framed message) study was conducted. Participants browsed through an online health magazine while their message choices were unobtrusively logged. A subsequent online questionnaire assessed personality dispositions and behavioral intentions. High levels of message susceptibility increased both selective exposure to health messages and respondents’ motivation to engage in adaptive health behaviors. Gain–loss framing did not affect message exposure or behavioral intentions, with one exception: Avoidance-oriented low-anxious respondents selected more loss-framed than gain-framed articles for reading. Repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation did not moderate health message effects, but partly influenced these measures directly or in combination. The number of articles to choose from was limited, and it is unclear to what extent the findings can be generalized to other, more familiar health topics. Emphasizing readers’ susceptibility to health threats appears very effective for increasing exposure to health messages and protective behavioral intentions. The effectiveness of gain–loss framing, by contrast, largely depends on moderating factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Hastall, Matthias R.;Wagner, Anna J.

"Journal Article","Initiating joint attention with a smile: Intervention for children with autism.","Joint attention (JA) involves gaze, gesture, and vocal behavior as well as the expression of positive affect such as smiling. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate deficits in JA and affective expression in early childhood, suggesting the need to teach both. We taught children with ASD to shift their gaze and smile in a pattern that mirrors initiating joint attention (IJA). The intervention involved the use of a visual prompt and reinforcement. All children shifted gaze and smiled, showed some generalization and maintenance at 3-month follow-up, and showed changes in the quality of interactions as judged by blind observers. This study extends JA intervention research to address aspects of IJA and the expression of affect.

"Journal Article","SMART longitudinal analysis: A tutorial for using repeated outcome measures from SMART studies to compare adaptive interventions.","In recent years, there has been increased interest in the development of adaptive interventions across various domains of health and psychological research. An adaptive intervention is a protocolized sequence of individualized treatments that seeks to address the unique and changing needs of individuals as they progress through an intervention program. The sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental study design that can be used to build the empirical basis for the construction of effective adaptive interventions. A SMART involves multiple stages of randomizations; each stage of randomization is designed to address scientific questions concerning the best intervention option to employ at that point in the intervention. Several adaptive interventions are embedded in a SMART by design; many SMARTs are motivated by scientific questions that concern the comparison of these embedded adaptive interventions. Until recently, analysis methods available for the comparison of adaptive interventions were limited to end-of-study outcomes. The current article provides an accessible and comprehensive tutorial to a new methodology for using repeated outcome data from SMART studies to compare adaptive interventions. We discuss how existing methods for comparing adaptive interventions in terms of end-of-study outcome data from a SMART can be extended for use with longitudinal outcome data. We also highlight the scientific utility of using longitudinal data from a SMART to compare adaptive interventions. A SMART study aiming to develop an adaptive intervention to engage alcohol- and cocaine-dependent individuals in treatment is used to demonstrate the application of this new methodology.

"Journal Article","Exploring the use of Sidekicks! For children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","Clinicians and educators are increasingly using technology within the context of existing therapies and teaching methodologies. The growing use of mobile clinical tools is particularly exciting for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as technologically based interventions have been shown to be both efficacious (to target academics, adaptive behavior, disruptive behavior, etc.) and accepted in this population (Odom et al., 2015). In addition, these tools have the potential to address two significant impediments in ASD intervention, the anxiety and/or skill deficits often associated with face-to-face interactions and skill generalization outside of the therapy office (Wieckowski & White, 2017). In other words, the use of technology may serve as an important preliminary or prerequisite step for face-to-face therapeutic progress. The purpose of this paper is to present a new, interactive clinical app that explicitly utilizes an individual’s restricted interests to teach skills and improve communication. The paper will briefly review the ways in which individuals with ASD may be good candidates for technological-based interventions, explore the current role of technology in existing evidence-based therapies, and discuss the use of a new technology, Sidekicks!, that has been developed for this population. A case example will then illustrate the use of Sidekicks! and its anticipated functionality across several public service settings, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and school systems, thereby coordinating the intervention efforts of various professionals involved in the treatment of children with ASD. Finally, limitations of the app (and of technology more generally) and the need for future research will be discussed.

Participants were 420 college students who completed measures of career exploration and decision-making self-efficacy, outcome expectations, social support, goals, and actions, along with trait conscientiousness, at 2 time points roughly 4 months apart, near the beginning and middle of an academic year. They also reported their level of career decidedness and decisional anxiety at both of these time points as well as near the end of the academic year (about 3 months after the 2nd assessment). The model provided good overall fit to the data and accounted for substantial portions of the variance in engagement in exploratory actions and in the 2 decisional outcomes (decidedness and decisional anxiety) over time. The findings also supported the hypothesized bidirectional paths of the decisional outcomes to self-efficacy and outcome expectations. We consider implications of the findings for the social–cognitive model as well as for future research and practice.
