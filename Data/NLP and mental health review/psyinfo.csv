"Journal Article","Exploration of benefits and potential harmful effects of an online forum for visitors to the suicide prevention platform in The Netherlands.","Background: Online forums that enable peer-to-peer interaction are widespread and readily available. Aim: This study aimed to identify the reach, benefits, and potential harmful effects for visitors to an online forum embedded in a suicide prevention platform in The Netherlands. Method: The study collected web-based questionnaires from online forum users and moderated posts. Descriptive quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Results: The online forum had 330 members in 2017, of whom 130 were active users (posting at least one message). Respondents (n = 106) experienced from a high severity of suicidal ideation (78%). A minority (12%) visited the forum to find suicide methods and 3% to find a suicide partner. Among respondents who had visited the forum more than once (n = 49), 53% reported no changes in feelings directly after forum use, 35% felt better and 12% felt worse. Peer support and anonymity were the most mentioned benefits, whereas no personal contacts and few reactions to postings were perceived as limitations. Suicide threats and the search for methods were the main reasons for moderating posts. Limitations: Usage habits and user experiences were available from a relatively small group that visited the forum more than once. Conclusion: In its current form, the forum has a low reach with few benefits and a potential for harm for its users. With a questionable benefit-to-risk ratio, the added value of the online forum appears to be small.

"Journal Article","Evaluating clinical outcomes in practice settings: Beyond the limits of grant-funded clinical research.","Effectiveness trials of manualized interventions in real-world contexts are critical to promote high-quality clinical care and to advance the field of health service psychology. However, conducting research in real-world clinic settings is challenging due to many practical constraints, such as limited research funding and personnel for the completion of research tasks. The current article describes how clinicians and researchers at 3 outpatient clinics affiliated with an academic medical center overcame practical and financial constraints to adopt and evaluate a child emotion regulation and social skills training intervention with minimal research funding. We provide an overview of challenges encountered, including adopting a new intervention, balancing the competing demands of program fidelity and flexibility, selecting and administering assessment measures, staffing for research tasks, ethical considerations for choosing a comparison control group and randomizing patients to conditions, and addressing patient concerns about research involvement. Potential solutions that may be of use to other community clinic settings or underresourced clinical research programs are suggested. These include using free, psychometrically sound measures to gather program outcome data, applying for philanthropic and nongovernment grants, dedicating a fixed portion of a clinic’s income to research-related activities, working collaboratively with affiliated or nearby research institutions, engaging volunteers and trainees to support research efforts, and using a treatment-as-usual comparison condition.

"Journal Article","Men who intervene to prevent sexual assault: A grounded theory study on the role of masculinity in bystander intervention.","Sexual violence is a significant public health problem, particularly on college campuses, and disproportionately impacts women. Bystander intervention training has been identified as a promising intervention against sexual assault, as a third party is present in ∼1 in 3 incidents of sexual assault. However, research has found that men report greater barriers to intervention and less efficacy and intention to intervene. Research suggests that men’s masculine norm socialization may contribute to reluctance to intervene, but there is little research on the role of masculinity in potentially facilitating intervention. The purpose of this study was to identify an outlier population of college men (N = 15) who have intervened against sexual assault and to qualitatively examine the social and gender-relevant factors that influenced their intervention. Using grounded theory analysis, results indicated that the core category of “bystander intervention” was composed of direct, indirect, and passive bystander behaviors. These behaviors were influenced by five key categories, which included (a) exposure to training, (b) the role of alcohol, (c) social factors, (d) individual characteristics, and (e) masculine norms. Participants described their development and navigation of masculine norms, which in turn shaped their individual characteristics, exposure to training, and how they navigated the high-risk environments where they noticed potential assaults. Participants also described their decision-making process around intervening and the strategies they used to intervene. We present an emerging theory for understanding college men’s bystander intervention against sexual assault, incorporating both individual and social factors and the complex role of masculine norms.

"Journal Article","Religious identity and psychological well-being among middle-eastern migrants in Australia: The mediating role of perceived social support, social connectedness, and perceived discrimination.","This study aims to examine the relative contribution of religious identity, social support, social connectedness, and perceived discrimination on psychological well-being (PWB) among Middle Eastern (ME) migrants in Australia. This cross-sectional study was conducted within Queensland, Australia. A total of 382 first-generation young adult ME migrants, aged 20–39 years, filled out a self-administered questionnaire. The hypothesized model was tested using a 2-step process: measurement and structural model testing. First, confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the fitness of the measurement model, and reliability and validity indices were calculated. Structural equations modeling was then applied to test the structural model. The mediation analyses were tested using a bootstrapping method. Social support had the largest total effect on PWB through both a direct and an indirect effect via perceived discrimination and social connectedness with ethnic community (SCETH). Religious identity demonstrated both a direct and an indirect effect on PWB through social support, perceived discrimination, SCETH, and social connectedness with mainstream community (SCMN). Perceived discrimination showed a direct and an indirect effect on PWB, mediated by SCMN. The SCETH and SCMN had only direct effects on PWB. Developing interventions that assist religious institutions/networks in offering support and/or strategies to provide support to ME migrants through religious organizations could be helpful in increasing their PWB. Protecting ME migrants against discrimination based on their religious affiliation is a main area of action. Interventions that promote ME migrants’ interaction with others could result in their better mental health outcomes.

"Journal Article","Providers’ involvement of blended families in pediatric weight management programs.","Introduction: Family based interventions are the standard for pediatric weight management programs (PWMPs), yet the details of how to involve additional family members, when youth are part of blended families (i.e., step families) or reside in multiple households is not well understood. The objective of this study is to describe how providers involve blended families and multiple households in PWMPs. Method: A cross-sectional exploratory survey was conducted of providers at PWMPs in the United States and Canada. The survey questions included had both multiple choice and open-ended responses. Univariate analyses were conducted. Results: 71 providers participated, representing 47 centers/clinics. The majority (96%) reported assessing multiple households, most often during the medical history. Providers reported including the primary caretakers at all known residences (59%), but not immediate family members beyond the primary caretakers. Providers reported adapting dietary (88%) and physical activity (77%) recommendations to accommodate multiple households. The most frequent adaptations included the goals at each family/household, adjustments on a per family basis or based on family resources, and making materials available to all family members. The most frequent challenges in extending treatment plans to multiple households included one caretaker/household not willing to participate or being present at visits, and inconsistency between households. Despite providers reporting that they assess multiple households, they did not have a formal interview template or form to use in assessments (27%). Discussion: Providers recognize the challenges and complexity that blended families present with in obesity treatment. Further research is need to increase provider assessment and involvement of blended families and the extension of goals and treatment plans to multiple homes.

"Journal Article","Christian meditation for repetitive negative thinking: A multisite randomized trial examining the effects of a 4-week preventative program.","In the current study, the authors examined the effects of a manualized, preventative program for Christians with repetitive negative thinking (RNT), utilizing Christian meditation as a Christian-sensitive alternative to Buddhist-informed mindfulness meditation. After randomizing participants to a 4-week program or wait-list at two Christian universities, the intervention group received instruction in both kataphatic (using words and images) and apophatic (wordless and imageless) Christian meditation and practiced in a weekly group meeting and on their own. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed several interaction effects (Condition × Time), with the Christian meditation group (n = 36) outperforming the wait-list group (n = 35) on a variety of outcome measures, including experiences of humility and surrendering to God (medium effect sizes), as well as nonattachment and perseverative thinking (large effect sizes). Findings suggest that Christian meditation may hold promise as a daily practice among Christians for the prevention of emotional disorders. Study limitations and directions for future research are also discussed.

"Journal Article","Mental contrasting and implementation intentions to increase physical activity in sedentary, disadvantaged adults: A pilot intervention.","Socioeconomically disadvantaged people in high-income countries like Australia do less physical activity than their more affluent counterparts. Mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) is a goal-setting and goal-striving process that aims to improve self-regulation. The current study explored the feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial that used MCII to increase physical activity levels—and to improve stage of exercise behavior change, self-efficacy, and anthropometric indices—in sedentary, socioeconomically disadvantaged adults in South-East Sydney. Thirty-two people aged 18–65 years were randomized to intervention (n = 15) or control (n = 15) groups, with 30 completing the study, but only 27 supplied reliable self-report physical activity data for analyses. Fitbit accelerometers, physical activity diaries, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire captured physical activity levels across 12 weeks. The control group received physical activity information only via e-mail, whereas the intervention group were also guided through the MCII process during the face-to-face baseline meeting. The intervention group had significantly higher levels of mean minutes and Metabolic Equivalent of Task-minutes of physical activity per week at 12 weeks than the control group. There were no significant differences between groups for overall step counts, but the intervention group took significantly more steps than the control group at Weeks 2, 9 and 10. There were no significant between-groups differences in stage of exercise behavior change, self-efficacy, and anthropometry. This study gives preliminary data that shows promise for using MCII to increase physical activity levels in sedentary, socioeconomically disadvantaged people.

"Journal Article","Community-informed strategies to address trauma and enhance resilience in climate-affected communities.","Trauma from natural disasters affects hurricane-impacted populations with accelerating frequency and often recurrently as a result of climate change. Policy guidance to support community resilience has emerged to mitigate trauma to populations facing disaster and climate change risk, but the guidance itself may be met with mistrust due to historic and recurrent government failures to support traumatized, hurricane-affected communities. The aim of the Community Resilience Learning Collaborative and Research Network study is to address trauma and improve community resilience in response to disaster and climate change-related events in South Louisiana. Key informant interviews from 47 community-based organizations across New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Coastal Louisiana were analyzed and compared with the Key Messages of the 4th National Climate Assessment to determine efficient strategies for building resilience. Community-based organization interviewees emphasized the importance of organizing community-led coalitions and partnerships, implementing trauma-informed care in schools and health care settings, providing infrastructures and educational resources to navigate housing and financial barriers, and creating dialogue to better understand and accept climate change. The strategies revealed in the key informant interviews will be used to design the agency-level coalition-building interventions of Community Resilience Learning Collaborative and Research Network.

"Journal Article","Family-based prevention of adolescents’ co-occurring internalizing/externalizing problems through early childhood parent factors.","Objective: We evaluated whether initiating the Family Check-Up (FCU) during early childhood prevented a severe form of psychopathology in adolescence—co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems—and whether effects operated indirectly through early childhood maternal depression and parents’ positive behavior support. Method: Participants were drawn from a randomized controlled trial of the FCU (50.2% FCU; 49.5% girls; 46.6% Caucasian, and 27.6% Black; 13.4% Hispanic/Latino). At Ages 2 and 3, mothers self-reported depression, and primary caregivers’ (PCs’) positive behavior support was coded by trained observers. PCs, alternate caregivers (ACs), and teachers reported on 14-year-olds’ problem behaviors. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) identified problem behavior groups for each reporter, which were outcomes in multinomial logistic regressions (PC, n = 672; AC, n = 652; teacher, n = 667). Results: LPAs identified a low-problem, internalizing-only, externalizing-only, and co-occurring-problem group for each reporter. For PC- and AC-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, externalizing-only (p < .05), and internalizing-only (p < .05 for PC, p < 0.10 for AC) groups; these effects operated through maternal depression (p < .05). For teacher-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, internalizing-only, and externalizing-only (p < 0.05) groups; effects operated through positive behavior support (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Early delivery of the FCU indirectly prevented adolescents’ co-occurring internalizing/externalizing problems in both home and school contexts by improving the quality of the early home environment.

"Journal Article","Systematic review of the inclusion of people with psychosis in suicide-specific clinical trials.","Background: Psychosis is a significant, yet understudied, risk factor for suicide. There has yet to be a systematic investigation examining the rate and predictors of inclusion of psychotic disorders or symptoms in suicide-focused trials. Aim: Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of inclusion/exclusion of psychosis in studies with suicidal ideation or behavior as a primary endpoint, rate of inclusion across intervention type and other characteristics, and criteria used to exclude psychosis and accompanying rationale. Method: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo to identify relevant articles published between 2000 and 2018. Statements regarding inclusion/exclusion were codified by authors. Results: Out of 122 studies selected, 75 (61.5%) excluded individuals with psychosis. This rate varied by intervention and sample size, but not by year of study or country of origin. Only 9% provided a rationale for psychosis exclusion. Limitations: Minimal reporting of participants' diagnosis in studies disallowed analysis of the rate of inclusion of psychosis in samples. Conclusion: Three out of five trials with suicide-related primary outcomes excluded psychosis; thus, people with psychosis are poorly represented in suicide-specific studies. This disparity could be remedied by either adapting protocols to include people with psychosis or developing new, tailored treatments.

"Journal Article","Inclusion of rural populations in a sample of current mental health intervention research.","Both rural and urban/suburban mental health practitioners are encouraged and sometimes required to use evidence-based practices (EBPs). However, little is known about the body of relevant empirical evidence available to inform effective implementation of EBPs in rural mental health practice. The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory systematic review of a sample of current literature describing the testing of psychosocial or behavioral health interventions conducted using a rural sample. A systematic examination of 53 peer-reviewed journals that were published during calendar year 2017 and included the term mental health or behavioral health in their titles was conducted. Selected journals were first systematically reviewed for articles reporting the testing of a psychosocial or behavioral health intervention. The researchers assessed a sample of 183 articles that were determined to report intervention research results and were subsequently assessed for the use of a rural sample. Fewer than 5% (8 of 183) of the included articles identified utilization of a rural population as all or part of the sample. Furthermore, within the 8 included articles, only 2 studies reported findings specific and generalizable to rural practice. The findings of the current study suggest a lack of rural-based mental health outcome research and an urban-centric perspective. The researchers highlight the need for empirical evidence assessing treatment and interventions that are tested and effective within rural community practice.

"Journal Article","A case report illustrating the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cue-induced craving in an individual with opioid and cocaine use disorder.","Nationally, it was estimated that 11.4 million people misused opioids in 2017 with more than 47,000 opioid-related deaths. Although medication-assisted treatment (MAT) has been effective in enhancing treatment retention and decreasing frequency of opioid use, relapse rates for opioids and other substances remain high, emphasizing the importance of investigating novel interventions to augment MAT. One potential treatment approach is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)—a noninvasive, electrophysiological method of neuromodulation. Recently published studies of rTMS in individuals with alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine use disorder have suggested that this treatment shows promise in reducing cravings and substance use. The literature specific to rTMS and opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited to a single published study in heroin users, which showed that a single session of rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduced cue-induced craving, with a further reduction following 5 consecutive days of rTMS. The following case report involved a 25-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with OUD and cocaine use disorder. This subject continued to demonstrate ongoing substance use despite participating in comprehensive MAT with buprenorphine/naloxone in combination with psychosocial interventions. He was administered 7 separate sessions of rTMS targeting the left DLPFC. Substance-related cues were presented prior to, during, and following these rTMS administration sessions and the subject rated his substance cravings via a 100-point Visual Analog Scale. When compared with his cue-induced craving ratings, there was a mean reduction in craving for heroin and cocaine by ∼60% to 82% following the 7 administration sessions. Although this is a single case, further investigation of rTMS as an augmentation strategy for OUD and polysubstance use is warranted.

"Journal Article","Metropolitan Atlanta Community Adolescent Rapid Testing Initiative: The impact of motivational interviewing and intensive case management on the psychosocial and clinical care outcomes of adolescents and young adults with HIV.","Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to preventing HIV-related complications and transmission for adolescents and young adults with HIV. The Metropolitan Atlanta Community Adolescent Rapid Testing Initiative (MACARTI) was a single-center, prospective, nonrandomized, interventional control group study incorporating motivational interviewing psychotherapy strategies with community outreach, HIV testing, and intensive case management. This substudy of MACARTI examined how the motivational interviewing and case management components influenced psychological distress, proactive coping, HIV/AIDS stress, and HIV stigma in association with HIV disease markers (HIV viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts). Ninety-eight adolescents and young adults with HIV (Mage = 21.5 ± 1.8, range 18–24) were allocated to either the standard of care (n = 49) or MACARTI (n = 49) arms, and results were compared between these two groups. Baseline and follow-up surveys measured psychological distress, proactive coping, HIV/AIDS stress, and HIV stigma. MACARTI arm assignment was associated with statistically significant reductions in psychological distress (p = .016), HIV/AIDS stress (p = .023), and the use of more reflective coping (p = .016) and strategic planning strategies (p = .001) during the first 6 months. These results did not remain significant at 1-year follow-up but may still provide support for the integration of psychotherapy strategies into HIV identification, linkage, and retention efforts in the future.

The aim of this article was to identify whether existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the care of self-harm in adolescents considered the screening, diagnosis, and/or treatment of BPD. Previous work by Courtney, Duda, Szatmari, Henderson, and Bennett (2018) used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods to identify 10 CPGs relevant to self-harm in children and adolescents. In this study, the 10 CPGs were reviewed for content about screening, assessment, and/or treatment recommendations for adolescents with BPD. Out of the 10 CPGs, 4 acknowledged the association between BPD and self-harm in adolescents. There was minimal to no guidance provided in the CPGs regarding specific screening, assessment, or treatment strategies for BPD. This may be due to the lack of evidence for efficacy and effectiveness of screening for BPD, thereby limiting the development of guideline recommendations. Studies that examine the impact of screening for BPD in clinical settings are needed. In the interim, CPGs should cite the prevalence of BPD in adolescents who self-harm and reference research showing the benefit of treatment with dialectical behavioral therapy for self-harm and suicide attempts in youth with BPD.

"Journal Article","Efficacy of a reminiscing and emotion training intervention on maltreating families with preschool-aged children.","The current investigation reports the results of a randomized controlled trial of a brief, relational intervention for maltreated preschool-aged children and their mothers, called Reminiscing and Emotion Training (RET). RET facilitates elaborative and emotionally supportive parent–child communication, which is an essential component of the parent–child relationship and is especially relevant for the preschool age period. Participants were 248 children between the ages of 3- to 6-years-old and their mothers. Following a baseline assessment, 165 maltreating families were randomized into RET or a Community Standard (CS) condition in which families received case management and written parenting information; 83 families participated in the nonmaltreating comparison condition. Results indicated that the key mechanisms targeted by the RET interventions were enhanced, such that mothers who participated in RET were significantly better in elaboration and sensitive guidance during reminiscing at the posttest than were maltreating mothers who did not receive the intervention, with medium to large effect sizes; additionally, mothers in the RET group were more elaborative than mothers from the nonmaltreatment group. Children in the RET condition also contributed significantly more memories and had better emotional knowledge than did children in the CS condition, controlling for baseline values and language, and approximated the functioning of nonmaltreated children. These findings add to a growing literature underscoring the benefits of brief, focused, relational interventions for maltreated children and their caregivers.

"Journal Article","Agreement between structured descriptive assessments and functional analyses conducted over a telehealth system.","This study examined whether experimental functional analyses (FAs) conducted by parents at home with coaching via telehealth would produce differentiated results, and compared these results to the functions identified from structured descriptive assessments (SDAs) also conducted by parents at home via telehealth. Four boys between the ages of 4- and 8-years old with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their parents participated. All assessments were conducted in the children’s homes with their parents serving as intervention agents and with coaching from remote behavior therapists using videoconferencing technology. Parent-implemented FAs produced differentiated results for all 4 children in the study. Overall, analyzing antecedent-behavior (A-B) and behavior-consequence (B-C) relations from the SDA videos identified only half of the functions identified by the FAs. For children whose SDA results were differentiated, analyzing A-B relations correctly identified 4 of 5 functions. Analyzing B-C relations correctly identified 5 of 6 functions identified by the experimental FA, but overidentified attention for all children. Implications for conducting functional analyses and interpreting structured descriptive assessment via telehealth are discussed.

"Journal Article","Predicting implementation of an empirically supported treatment for cancer patients using the theory of planned behavior.","Background: There is a continuing gap between the availability of cancer control empirically supported treatments (ESTs) to address psychological needs of cancer patients and their dissemination to and implementation by providers in the community. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), with constructs of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions, is used to understand the pathways to and prediction of providers’ behavior, that is, implementation of a cancer control EST and its provision to patients. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to prospectively test the TPB in predicting providers’ usage of a cancer-specific EST, the biobehavioral intervention (BBI). Method: Providers (N = 166) were trained. At training’s end, providers completed measures of attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and intentions to use the BBI, and their supervisors completed measures of attitudes operationalized as subjective norms. Providers were followed up and 4 months later reported their usage of the BBI with patients in the last 2 months. Regression-based path analyses tested attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and intentions as predictors of BBI usage and for the possible effect of intentions as a mediator. Results: Provider’s BBI usage was high, delivered to 65.6% of patients. Providers’ attitudes toward the BBI (b = .006; 95% confidence interval [CI: .002, .010]) and subjective norms (supervisors’ attitudes toward providers’ EST usage; b = .021; 95% CI [.007, .034]) predicted usage. Intentions predicted usage in univariate analyses but was not a mediator for usage. Conclusions: Use of theory in implementation science can test and identify variables key to implementation success. Here the TPB identified providers’ and supervisors’ attitudes as predictors of EST usage.

"Journal Article","Correlates and predictors of mental health care utilization for veterans with PTSD: A systematic review.","Objective: Treatment utilization among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is low. Understanding correlates and predictors of mental health care for veterans with PTSD is critical to facilitating treatment utilization. However, given the size of the literature base and disparate findings, it is difficult to interpret available research. Correlates and predictors of mental health care for veterans with PTSD published between 2012 and 2016 were examined to (a) define the scope of recent literature and (b) summarize predictive evidence. Method: This 2-phase systematic review conducted scientific database searches. Phase 1 defined the scope of recent literature (n = 51) and tabulated types of correlates, outcomes, and sources of bias. Phase 2 summarized results from prospective studies (n = 17) evaluating mental health care utilization (PROSPERO ID No. CRD42017082686). Results: Demographics−social network characteristics (61%) and evaluated need (61%) were the most common correlates of mental health utilization. Facilitators with the strongest evidence for predicting utilization (both initiation and retention) were characteristics of the episode of care (e.g., mental health in primary care) and greater PTSD symptom severity. Study biases favoring Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) enrollees (92%) and excluding outside VA care outcomes (86%) limit generalizability of results. Conclusions: Efforts focused on providing mental health in primary care, interventions to address mental health beliefs, and outreach to racial−ethnic minority veterans and those with mild to moderate PTSD could increase mental health care utilization.

"Journal Article","Effects of emulation training on activities of daily living and job-related skills.","As children get older and prepare for a life of self-reliance, it becomes necessary for them to acquire new skills as well as generalize responding across novel settings—without the continuous involvement of a parent or teacher. The ability for an individual to emulate their environment, rather than imitate or rely on cues provided by others, translates to a level of greater independence. Emulation occurs when an individual emits one or more responses that produce an environmental change such that the change mimics or matches the condition of a visual model. The present study tested a procedure to assess the presence of emulation, to train emulation, and to test whether having it in one’s repertoire would result in participants emulating novel tasks independently. Results showed that all participants emulated novel tasks after completing emulation training. These results are discussed as they relate to programming for daily living and vocational tasks.

"Journal Article","Mexican immigrant fathers’ recognition of and coping with maternal depression: The influence of meaning-making on marital and co-parenting roles among men participating in a family intervention.","Fathers play a critical role in recognizing and responding to maternal depression and providing support to the family during the mothers’ illness and recovery. Our study adopted a dual method approach, initially consisting of sample interviewing with 10 Mexican immigrant fathers about their partner’s depression and recovery, co-parenting, and fathers’ coping. Fathers, their partners, and children participated in a family intervention to support the mother’s recovery and address the needs of the family. Approximately 12 months from sample interviews and 8 months after the intervention, we conducted in-depth case studies with 3 of those fathers to explore how their recognition, support, and coping evolved. Results from interviews across time points present fathers’ initial and evolving understanding of maternal depression, and a case study example reflects how fathers’ recognition of their partners’ depression changed, as did their marital and family interactions, as they shifted attribution of their partners’ depression from a controllable state to one of illness. Receipt of accurate information about depression increased fathers’ recognition of depression and allowed them to expand traditional gender norms to take an active role in supporting their partners and children. Fathers’ experiences were not without emotional cost, with many men recounting anxiety, shame, loneliness, and helplessness. This study underscores the importance of including fathers in interventions and research on maternal depression in immigrant families, and it offers recommendations for culturally grounded, family-focused interventions.

"Journal Article","Associations between self-monitoring and weight change in behavioral weight loss interventions.","Objective: The current study is a secondary analysis of the Live SMART trial, a randomized controlled trial comparing a behavioral weight loss (BWL) condition delivered via smartphone (SMART) to a group-based BWL condition (GROUP) and a control condition (CONTROL). Given the established importance of self-monitoring for weight loss, the aims were to evaluate bidirectional associations between adherence to self-monitoring and weight change and to examine the moderating effect of treatment condition on these associations. Method: Adults with overweight/obesity (n = 276; 83% women; 92.8% White; Mage = 55.1 years; Mbody mass index = 35.2 kg/m2) were instructed to self-monitor dietary intake, daily weight, and physical activity minutes via paper diaries in GROUP and CONTROL and via a smartphone application in SMART. All participants were weighed monthly at the research center. Adherence to self-monitoring was assessed via examination of self-monitoring records. Results: Generalized linear mixed models revealed that adherence to self-monitoring of dietary intake, self-weighing, and physical activity for each month was associated with weight change throughout that month, such that increased frequency of self-monitoring led to greater weight loss (ps < .001). For the GROUP condition only, poorer weight losses in 1 month were prospectively associated with poor adherence to self-monitoring the following month (ps ≤ .01). Conclusions: Results provide evidence of a bidirectional association between self-monitoring and weight change. Better self-monitoring was consistently associated with better weight loss across intervention and tracking modalities. Poorer weight loss was prospectively associated with poorer self-monitoring in group treatment, suggesting that social influences could drive adherence in this form of treatment.

"Journal Article","Online expressive writing intervention for reintegration difficulties among veterans: Who is most likely to benefit?","Objective: Some veterans may benefit from psychosocial interventions to facilitate reintegration and prevent chronic impairments following discharge from the service. In a randomized controlled trial, an online expressive writing intervention for Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans with reintegration difficulties reduced distress relative to control conditions, albeit with small between-group effect sizes (Sayer, Noorbaloochi et al., 2015). The aims of this study were to further explore changes in distress severity in the parent study’s experimental group by identifying subgroups with similar trajectories and examining predictors of those trajectories. Method: We used latent class growth modeling to identify trajectories of change in distress among veterans randomized into expressive writing (N = 508). We also tested six predictors of trajectory membership: baseline probable PTSD, social support, combat exposure, sex, VA user status, and active-duty versus National Guard/Reserve status. The sample was mostly White, middle-aged, Army veterans deployed from active duty, all of whom reported reintegration difficulties. Results: A four-class model, with the following classes, best fit the data: Low Baseline Distress–Moderate Decrease (60%; Cohen’s d = −0.69), Moderate Baseline Distress–No Change (25%; Cohen’s d = −0.16), Severe Baseline Distress–Small Increase (10%; Cohen’s d = 0.23), and Severe Baseline Distress–Very Large Decrease (5%; Cohen’s d = −4.80). Veterans without probable PTSD, with less combat exposure, and with higher social support were more likely to be in classes with decreasing distress. Conclusion: Analyses revealed several subgroups with unique patterns of change. Non-therapist-assisted expressive writing may be most suitable for veterans with less complex psychosocial problems.

"Journal Article","Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign for social anxiety disorder.","Attitudinal barriers impede treatment-seeking behaviors in individuals with anxiety disorders. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing campaigns can be a useful approach for reducing barriers and promoting evidence-based psychotherapy; however, little research evaluating the effectiveness of such campaigns for the anxiety disorders exists. The current project presents the results of 2 studies that tested the impact of a brief video campaign focused on social anxiety disorder (SAD) and cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT), aimed to improve knowledge, reduce stigma, and improve attitudes/perceptions toward evidence-based psychotherapy. Study 1 (N = 220) tested the impact of this campaign in a cross-sectional sample, and Study 2 (N = 276) was a preregistered project designed to replicate and extend results from Study 1 using a more tailored stigma instrument and testing the durability of effects (i.e., over 2-week follow-up). Both studies demonstrate that the campaign had a meaningful and lasting impact on knowledge about SAD and CBT, though the impact on stigma and treatment attitudes was less encouraging. This is the first study to assess the sustained impacts of a DTC campaign developed for an anxiety disorder and its evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment.

"Journal Article","The effect of early discrimination on accelerated aging among African Americans.","Objective: This study examined the role of depressive symptoms in mediating the relationship between early life experiences of racial discrimination and accelerated aging in adulthood for African Americans (i.e., prediction over a 19-year period, from ages 10 to 29) after adjusting for gender and health behaviors. Method: Longitudinal self-report data over 7 waves of data collection from the Family and Community Health Study were utilized. The sample included 368 African Americans with usable gene expression data to compute accelerated aging, as well as complete data on all self-report variables including racial discrimination (Schedule of Racist Events) and depression (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children—Version 4). Blood was collected by antecubital blood draws from participants at age 29. The proposed model was tested by path analysis. Results: Findings revealed that high discrimination at ages 10–15 was associated with depression at ages 20–29 (β = .19, p = .001), controlling for depression at ages 10–15, which, in turn, was related to accelerated cellular-level aging (β = .11, p = .048) after controlling for gender, alcohol consumption, and cigarette use. The indirect effect of racial discrimination on aging through depression at ages 20–29 was significant (β = .021, 95% confidence interval [.001, .057]), accounting for 32.3% of the total variance. Conclusion: These findings support research conceptualizations that early life stress due to racial discrimination lead to sustained negative affective states continuing into young adulthood that confer risk for accelerated aging and possibly premature disease and mortality in African Americans. These findings advance knowledge of potential underlying mechanisms that influence racial health disparities.
