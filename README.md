# Personalized Treatment of Mental Health Problems using Adaptive Technology

List of `PhD` resources I want to share with the research community. I was associated with [INTROMAT](http://intromat.no/) project, which holds a vision of improving public mental health with innovative technologies and psychological treatments. I was a PhD candidate hired by the INTROMAT team to research the use of adaptive technology for the personalized treatment of mental health issues including [Depression](https://www.skmukhiya.com.np/category/mental-health/depression/), ADHD, Bipolar Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder.
